<title>KING'S SPEECH, OPENING THE SESSION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00026">The Session was this day opened by Commission. The Lords Commissioners were, Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of Shaftesbury, and Lord Ellenborough. The Usher of the Black Rod having summoned the Commons, the Speaker, attended by a number of Members, appeared at the bar; when the Lord Chancellor proceeded to read His Majesty's Speech to both Houses, as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"My Lords, and Gentlemen,</quote>
<quote>"We are commanded by His Majesty to acquaint you, that His Majesty continues to receive, from all Foreign Princes and States, assurances of their desire to maintain the relations of amity with this Country; and that the Great Powers of Europe participate in the earnest wish of His Majesty to cultivate a good understanding upon all points which may conduce to the preservation of Peace.</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty has viewed for some time past, with great concern, the state of affairs in the East of Europe.</quote>
<quote>"For several years a contest has been carried on between the Ottoman Porte and the Inhabitants of the Greek Provinces and Islands, which has been marked on each side by excesses revolting to humanity.</quote>
<col>2</col>
<quote>"In the progress of that Contest, the Rights of Neutral States, and the Laws which regulate the intercourse of civilized Nations, have been repeatedly violated, and the peaceful Commerce of His Majesty's Subjects has been exposed to frequent interruption, and to depredations, too often aggravated by acts of violence and atrocity.</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty has felt the deepest anxiety to terminate the calamities, and avert the dangers, inseparable from hostilities, which constitute the only exception to the general tranquillity of Europe.</quote>
<quote>"Having been earnestly entreated by the Greeks to interpose His good offices, with a view to effect a reconciliation between them and the Ottoman Porte, His Majesty concerted measures for that purpose, in the first instance, with the Emperor of Russia, and subsequently with his Imperial Majesty and the King of France.</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty has given directions that there should be laid before you Copies of a Protocol signed at Saint Petersburgh by the Plenipotentiaries of His Majesty and of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia, on the 4th of April, 1826, and of the Treaty entered into between His Majesty and the Courts of the Tuileries and of Saint Petersburgh, on the 6th of July, 1827.</quote>
<quote>"In the course of the measures adopted
<image src="S2V0018P0I0009"/>
<col>3</col>
with a view to carry into effect the object of the Treaty, a collision, wholly unexpected by His Majesty, took place in the Port of Navarin between the Fleets of the Contracting Powers and that of the Ottoman Porte.</quote>
<quote>"Notwithstanding the valour displayed by the Combined Fleet, His Majesty deeply laments that this conflict should have occurred with the Naval Force of an ancient Ally; but he still entertains a confident hope that this untoward event will not be followed by further hostilities, and will not impede that amicable adjustment of the existing differences between the Porte and the Greeks, to which it is so manifestly their common interest to accede.</quote>
<quote>"In maintaining the National Faith by adhering to the engagements into which His Majesty has entered, His Majesty will never lose sight of the great objects to which all his efforts have been directed&#x2014;the termination of the contest between the hostile parties.&#x2014;the permanent settlement of their future relations to each other&#x2014;and the maintenance of the repose of Europe upon the basis on which it has rested since the last general Treaty of Peace.</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty has the greatest satisfaction in informing you, that the purposes for which His Majesty, upon the requisition of the Court of Lisbon, detached a Military Force to Portugal have been accomplished. The obligations of good faith baying been fulfilled, and the safety and independence of Portugal secured, His Majesty has given orders that the forces now in that country should be immediately withdrawn.</quote>
<quote>"We are commanded by His Majesty to acquaint you, that His Majesty has concluded Treaties of Amity and Commerce with the Emperor of Brazil, and with the United States of Mexico; copies of which will, by His Majesty's commands, be laid before you.</quote>
<col>4</col>
<quote>"Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty has ordered the estimates for the Current year to be laid before you. They have been prepared with, every regard to economy, consistent with the exigency of the public service.</quote>
<quote>"We are commanded, by. His Majesty to recommend to your early attention an Inquiry into the State of the Revenue and Expenditure of the country.</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty is assured, that it will be satisfactory to you to learn, that, notwithstanding the diminution which has taken place in some branches of the Revenue, the total amount of receipt during the last year has not disappointed the expectations which were entertained at the commencement of it.</quote>
<quote>"My Lords and Gentlemen,</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty has commanded us to inform you, that a considerable increase has taken place in the export of the principal articles of British manufacture. This improvement of our Foreign Trade has led to a more general employment of the population, and affords a satisfactory indication of the continued abatement of those commercial difficulties, which recently affected so severely the National Industry.</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty commands us to assure you, that he places the firmest reliance upon your continued endeavours to improve the condition of all classes of his subjects, and to advance the great object of His, Majesty's solicitude, the prosperity and. happiness of his People."</quote></p>

<title>ADDRESS ON THE KING'S SPEECH.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00027">His Majesty's Speech having been again read by the Lord Chancellor, and also by the Clerk at the Table,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00028"><member>The Earl of Chichester</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;My Lords; In rising to address your lordships on the present occasion, with a view to propose that an humble and dutiful Address be presented to his Majesty, in reply to his most gracious Speech, which we have just heard read, I am fully sensible of the difficulties that must unavoidably, and of ne-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0010"/>
<col>5</col>
cessity, attend such a task&#x2014;a task that is at all times difficult, but which becomes doubly hazardous when undertaken by an individual so inexperienced as myself. I feel confident, however, my lords, that in proposing a loyal and dutiful Address of thanks to his Majesty for a Speech, the leading feature and principle of which consists in a recommendation to adopt, well-grounded precautions, to preserve peace and maintain whole and untarnished our national credit and honour&#x2014;I am confident, that in addressing myself to a subject like this, I may safely rely upon your lordships for support. I can assure your lordships, that if I shall not execute aright the task allotted to me, I shall fail in the attempt, not through any want of sincerity on my part, but in consequence of a deficiency of ability to explain and enforce those principles in the manner they deserve.<lb/>
My lords, reverting to the commencement of the Speech which you have just heard read, it appears from it, that "his Majesty continues to receive from all foreign Prince? and States, assurances of their desire to maintain the relations of amity with this country, and that the great Powers of Europe participate in the earnest wish of his Majesty to cultivate a good understanding upon all points which may conduce to the preservation of peace." My lords, I consider that this passage in his Majesty's Speech must be to your lordships, and the country at large, no small source of satisfaction; for, since the naval engagement which has recently taken place in the port of Navarin, between the Allied squadrons and the Turco-Egyptian fleet, I am aware that considerable fears have been entertained, that the condition of Greece would be rendered still more unfavourable than unfortunately it has long been. Besides, my lords, it may have been apprehended, that the peace which the greater part of Europe has so long enjoyed, might be thereby endangered, and that we ourselves, now scarcely beginning to reap the advantages and to taste the sweets consequent on a restoration of peace, were on the point of being deprived of them by becoming involved in a war with our ancient ally, the Ottoman Porte. My lords, while I am free to confess, that I deeply lament, the loss of valuable lives sustained on that occasion, I cannot but admire&#x2014;and I am certain every man in the country admires

&#x2014;the signal display of skill and valour made by our countrymen in the conflict&#x2014;a courage and ability only equalled by the no less meritorious exertions and conduct of our Allies. But, my lords, while I willingly pay my tribute of admiration to the gallantry of our brave countrymen upon that occasion, and however proud I may feel of their conduct, I am convinced that every true and ardent friend of his country must lament, in common with myself, the occurrence of so unfortunate an accident, or event, as that to which I have alluded [hear]. In all victories, my lords, the degree of honour to which the victors are entitled must very much, if it does not entirely, depend on the justice of the cause in which they happen to be engaged. Had this engagement between the allied squadrons and the Ottoman fleet, been, on our part, the result of premeditated design, and not as it was, the consequence of unforeseen accident, or a misunderstanding not to be provided against, I should find this war a difficult one to be defended, and, as it appears to me, we might all have reason to entertain fears for its consequences. However, on referring to the Speech from the Throne, his Majesty, it will be seen, expressly declares, that so far from this engagement being an act of premeditation, or contemplated as a consequence likely to be produced by the instructions sent out by the government at home to the British admiral&#x2014;so far from this being the case, the engagement, is characterised in the royal Speech, as an unexpected and "untoward event."&#x2014;Moreover, my lords, his Majesty goes on to declare, that he entertains "a confident hope, that this untoward event will not be followed by further hostilities, or impede that amicable adjustment of the existing differences between the Porte and the Greeks, to which it is manifestly their common interest to accede," and to which amicable adjustment I may be permitted to add, it is the object of the treaties, entered into by Great Britain, France, and Russia, to induce them to accede. My lords, I cannot help taking this opportunity of alluding to the dignified forbearance that has marked the conduct of the Sultan, since the occurrence of the event which brought the allied squadron in collision with the Turco-Egyptian fleet; and I look upon such conduct as an additional call upon Great Britain to do her part

towards maintaining that ancient alliance, which, with scarcely any interruption, has subsisted for so many years between this country and the Ottoman Porte. During the war which, unhappily for the interests of humanity, has been so long carried on between the Ottoman Porte and the inhabitants of the Greek provinces and islands, the trade of this country to the Levant suffered in common with that of France and other neutral powers&#x2014;and, I may add, suffered to no inconsiderable extent from piracies directly occasioned by, or collaterally arising out of, the hostilities subsisting between the two countries. It, therefore, became the policy of our government, as well for the protection of our own trade, as to promote the general peace and welfare of Europe, to endeavour to bring this contest to a speedy termination. Accordingly, measures were adopted for the amicable adjustment of the differences which subsisted; and to further this, a treaty was entered into with France and Russia, to which, as it is not yet regularly before your lordships' House, I shall not now more particularly refer. That the salutary object it possesses may be speedily carried into effect, is certainly most desirable, for our own interests, as well as for those of the rest of Europe. But it is no less essential to our national credit, and to the maintenance of that character for honour and good faith, which is the glory of our country, that we should not attempt to enforce it, by unprovokedly drawing our swords upon an ancient and faithful ally.&#x2014;My lords, the object for which our troops were sent to Lisbon has, it appears, been accomplished, and that they are about to return. I, therefore, hope that Portugal, for whose interest and protection we have formerly expended so much blood and treasure, may now, in security and independence, enjoy the benefit of that assistance which Great Britain has, at all times, so liberally afforded. &#x2014;My lords, with respect to that part of his Majesty's Speech which relates to the increased export of some of our manufactures, and a proportionate improvement in the condition of those classes connected with them, it cannot but be a source of considerable gratification to your lordships; and I trust that his majesty may not be disappointed in his reliance on parliament, to use its utmost endeavours to promote and extend such improvement in those and other classes of his Majesty's subjects.

&#x2014;My lords, I shall not trespass further on your lordships' time or patience, but will conclude by moving an humble Address to his Majesty, in answer to his most gracious Speech, which we have just heard read.&#x2014;The noble lord then moved an Address, which, as usual, was an echo of the Speech from the Throne [See Commons, p 41.]</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00029"><member>Lord Strangford</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;My Lords, in rising to second the motion of the noble lord, that an humble Address be presented to his Majesty, thanking him for the Speech which he has been graciously pleased to direct to be delivered from the Throne, I confess I feel peculiar satisfaction; the rather because I believe that the main points urged in that Speech are such as must necessarily convey a feeling of hope and consolation to all his Majesty's subjects. One ground of satisfaction at the tenor of the royal Speech is discoverable in the spirit of peace and amity that pervades it. It contains what may be construed into his Majesty's gracious declaration, and may be understood to convey an expression of the royal resolution, to use every possible exertion to maintain the repose of Europe on the firm foundation, the proud basis, on which the memorable efforts of English valour and conduct had placed it at the battle of Waterloo, and subsequently by means of the treaty of Paris. My Lords, I am rejoiced at the expression of such a sentiment; and connecting his Majesty's resolution with the peaceful assurances which our government continues to receive from the leading powers of Europe, I consider the Speech from the Throne well calculated to allay the anxiety which the present posture of public affairs in the east of Europe might otherwise excite. The maintenance of general tranquillity is an object well deserving the care of his Majesty's ministers, and, if steadily pursued, will confer more splendor, and reflect greater credit, on the national character, than the achievement of the most signal victories. At the same time, the peaceful triumphs to which I have alluded, not only possess the advantage of greater and more lasting renown, but are also more easily attained, than the hazardous, and sometimes ruinous, successes of war. My Lords, it is impossible to advert to a conflict, the occurrence of which we must all deplore, without admitting, that not even the glory connected with the achievement can, for a single instant, diminish the regret which our tri-

<col>9</col>
umph at Navarin must continue to excite in the minds of Britons, so long as national honour and gratitude shall continue to be the characteristics of Englishmen&#x2014;or so long as the remembrance of what Turkey has been to us, in the hour of peril, shall remain. I feel strongly, my lords, and it may be that I express myself warmly on this subject; and I ought to do so, for well I know the warmth of feeling which, in Turkey, prevails towards this country; and well do I know, and sincerely do I admire, the strict honour, the downright, undeviating fidelity, with which she has long fulfilled engagements and maintained relations of amity towards us. I will add, my lords, that theirs is a fidelity which has not proved the weaker, because it happens to rest less upon the faith of treaties and written documents, than on the simple guarantee of oral promises, entered into three hundred years ago, and from that period, handed down, traditionally, from generation to generation. My lords, I look forward with a confidence considerably strengthened by the spirit that pervades his Majesty's Speech, to the renewal and continuance of that cordial feeling, which every friend to both countries must desire to see subsisting between Turkey and England. I sincerely hope and trust&#x2014;notwithstanding the most unexpected and untoward event, which has recently occurred in the port of Navarin&#x2014;that a recurrence to our former relations of amity and friendly intercourse may not be impracticable. May I add, that I also hope that an end will be speedily put to those unauthorised and anomalous hostilities at present carried on by the romance or cupidity of individual adventurers, and which are but too well calculated, if permitted to continue, to embarrass the national councils, while they put in jeopardy the national honour. I trust, my lords, the day is not far distant when we shall again behold&#x2014;that which I had the pride and pleasure for many years myself of beholding&#x2014;the influence of England paramount, I may say omnipotent, at Constantinople. I trust events have recently taken place to accelerate an occurrence, of which all true friends of Turkey and England must ardently desire to witness the completion. Whatever may be said of Turkish apathy and indifference, there is one thing to which that people have never been indifferent&#x2014;a friendly connexion with England. To those relations, of which there never should have
<col>10</col>
been an interruption, I sincerely hope the two countries will speedily return; and that measures, the most active and decisive, provided they are consistent with recent treaties, may be resorted to, in order to renew a state of things, which every person acquainted with the circumstances of Turkey must wish to see established. Every principle, my lords, calls upon us to co-operate in accomplishing this object. Bound, as I admit we are, by the treaty of London, we are equally bound to carry its provisions into effect with the least possible disturbance to the interest and feelings of a government which, in the most trying times, has enlisted itself in our favour, and which has been invariably anxious to preserve with us friendly relations. That such is his Majesty's intention, I think, my lords, if any evidence were wanting, the Speech from the Throne affords sufficient proof. That such is the intention of the other powers who are parties to the treaty in question, may be inferred from circumstances which are, I hope, equally satisfactory, and, above all, from the spirit and purport of the treaty itself. Those powers, like ourselves, are at present on terms of amity with Turkey&#x2014;terms of amity which, I trust, no circumstances will be permitted to derange. Looking at all these considerations, and confiding, as circumstances have given me a right to confide, from personal knowledge and experience, in the high honour and unsullied character of one of the principal parties to that compact; I think there are little grounds to fear a breach of its provisions. I will add, that I am fully convinced that no prospect of political advantage will be suffered to pollute or change the object of a treaty, originating in the most humane and honourable motives. My lords, as you well know, I have had the honour to be employed as his Majesty's representative at the court of St. Petersburg, and I can affirm, from my own direct and immediate knowledge, that the views and sentiments of his imperial majesty, the emperor of Russia, are decidedly pacific, and are directed towards no other object than the maintenance of tranquillity, and the fulfilment of the treaty entered into by the courts of St. James's, the Tuileries, and St. Petersburg. Towards the preservation of tranquillity it was my duty to contribute, under the command of my gracious master, when at the court of St. Petersburg; and I invariably found his imperial

<col>11</col>
majesty ready to co-operate with my own Sovereign in the attainment of that desirable end.&#x2014;There is another topic in the royal Speech to which I advert with feelings of unmingled pleasure&#x2014;the conduct of England towards Portugal; a country to which we are bound by every the of friendship and interest. It is gratifying to see the friendly hand of England extended, and her power again successfully exerted, in behalf of that nation, and in defence of a country long united to us in bonds of the strictest amity. To England, and England alone, is the safety of Portugal to be ascribed, and on our efforts must her peace depend. What we have effected will bind her more closely than ever to our interests, and will entail upon her "a debt immense of endless gratitude." I shall trespass no further on your lordships' attention, than to express my sincere hope, that no difference of opinion upon matters which, at present, must necessarily be unaccompanied with explanation, will be permitted to disturb that unanimity which is so desirable on the present occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00030"><member>Lord Holland</member><membercontribution> next rose. He began by assuring their lordships, that he had no intention when he entered the House that evening, to trouble their lordships with any observations on the Speech which had been delivered to them from the Throne&#x2014;or to say one word which might interrupt the unanimity of their lordships on the present occasion. Many reasons, with which it was unnecessary to trouble their lordships, some of a private and personal nature, and some of a public and general character, made him wish not to enter into debate for any unnecessary purpose. He had expected, that the address which would be proposed that night in reply to his majesty's Speech would be one which would not cause any great, difference of opinion. He had been willing to overlook its faults of omission, many and grievous as they were: and he had been willing, moreover, to overlook any inconsiderate expressions, with which he might not be inclined to agree: and he would even now say, that with the general substance of the Speech he for one, was pretty well satisfied. He fully agreed with the noble lord, that the expressions which his majesty had used upon one great point&#x2014;he meant his desire for peace&#x2014;were such as became the Throne, and ought to be expected from it; and he felt as strongly as the Speech itself, that the great object
<col>12</col>
which his majesty's late government had had in view was the preservation of peace, and he made no doubt that those who had put the Speech into his majesty's mouth were actuated at present by similar wishes. To the substance of the Speech&#x2014;or he would rather say, to the substantives, of the Speech&#x2014;he felt little inclined to object; but there were epithets, there were adjectives added to those substantives, which conveyed to his mind impressions which were by no means warranted by facts, and to which he could not give his consent, even for a moment. The first was the calling the Ottoman Porte "our ancient ally." He knew hot what meaning the two noble lords who had just spoken annexed to the terms "antiquity" and "alliance." They must have other notions of "alliance" than he had; they must apply the term "ancient" in a sense which he could never allow it to have, when applied to transactions between nation and nation, when they presumed to say that Turkey was the "ancient ally" of Great Britain. If he understood any thing of the meaning of words, the only alliance of Great Britain with Turkey was very short-lived in its duration, and very recent in its history; for he did not suppose that the noble lords would contend, that the existence of peace or commercial treaties between the two countries constituted alliance between them. The address of that evening proved the contrary. In that address were mentioned treaties of amity and commerce concluded with a new republic of Mexico? Was it meant thereby that that republic, which was at war with Spain, was to be considered henceforward as an ally of Great Britain? He knew not what the precise meaning of the term "ally" was in diplomatic language, but he conceived that, in common parlance, it meant a party who had a common interest in the existence and prosperity of another party. Now, with respect to Turkey, it was not true to say, that she was the ancient ally of Great Britain, in this sense of the word. The alliance between the two countries had not existed at any time for more than seven years. "I can say, unfortunately for myself," continued his lordship, "that I am rather an old man in this House, I am long known to most of your lordships." I trust, however, that I am not yet become a piece of antiquity among you; and yet I recollect the first treaty of alliance that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0014"/>
<col>13</col>
was ever formed by this country with Turkey. It was thought extraordinary at the time, that one of the stipulations of that treaty should be, that it should only last seven years; and yet it may appear more extraordinary to your lordships to learn, that before those seven years had expired, every article in that treaty had been violated over and over again by Turkey. Our ancient ally&#x0021; I should like to know what was the nature of the alliance. The noble lord who spoke last admits that the alliance is not recognized by ancient treaty, but that it depends upon oral traditions, which had been handed down by one Turkish minister to another for the last three hundred years. We have heard, in various publications, of the antiquity of our commercial relations with Turkey; I am therefore anxious to say a word or two upon that part of the subject. I believe that they commenced in the reign of James, 1st; that they were formally recognized by the Porte to the time of Charles 2nd and William 3rd; and that they were at last brought into the shape of a treaty by an individual to whose exertions his country is highly indebted&#x2014;I mean my honourable friend Mr. Adair. To go through the whole of the negative proof which I could produce to convince your lordships that Turkey is not the ancient ally of England would be tedious. I shall content myself with observing, that the anti-social race which now enjoys the empire of the Constantines, considers itself naturally at war with every nation with which it has not entered into a formal treaty of peace. I do not deny that it has entered into a treaty of peace with us; but, can a treaty of peace be fairly considered as a treaty of alliance? The first treaty made between this country and Turkey, I have no doubt, was considered by the Turks, as an act of grace and concession, yielded by them, in the plenitude of their power to those dogs of Christians, the Nazarene nations. The privileges which were granted to our commerce, were obtained from the Porte about 1699, by lord Winchilsea and sir John Finch, and other able members of that family. But how, I would ask, were they granted? Were the names of lord Winchilsea or sir John Finch subscribed to any treaty which secured them? No such thing. The privileges were granted as we would throw a bone to a dog: they were given, too, fox very special reasons. And what do
<col>14</col>
your lordships suppose those reasons were? The first was, because the messages which Charles the 2nd had sent to the Sultan were of an agreeable nature; the second because Charles 2nd was considered to be a very powerful monarch among the Nazarene nations; and the last and most ludicrous was, because the Sultan had heard that Charles was the arbiter of the differences among them. For those reasons the Sultan granted to our countrymen what was called, by a sort of diplomatic euphonism, certain capitulations, but what I believe to have been called, in the Turkish language, boons or concessions. Those concessions or capitulations&#x2014;call them by which name you please&#x2014;were merely commercial; they gave to the subjects of Great Britain the same immunities which had been granted, on the same terms, to the subjects of France. We had, however, no political relations with Turkey, in any sense of the word, until the year 1699. In 1692, we offered our services to mediate between the emperor of Germany and the Turkish power who were then at war; and we did so, in order to leave our ancient ally, the house of Austria,&#x2014;for Austria was our ancient ally, and Russia, too, was our ancient ally,&#x2014;in a situation to direct her arms, along with us, against the then colossal power of France. And what was the result of that negotiation? We were accused, by French writers,&#x2014;I shall not stop to examine whether rightly or wrongly,&#x2014;of having exercised our mediation with gross partiality, and with having inflicted by it a severe injury on the Ottoman power. One of the articles in the treaty, into which the Turks entered under our mediations, was to this effect,&#x2014;that they should surrender the whole of the Morea and of Greece, into the hands of the Venetians. So that the result of our first political negotiation with Turkey was, to wrest Greece from its dominion; though, unfortunately, not for ever.&#x2014;In the year 1718, we again entered into a political negotiation with Turkey; but under circumstances which, I contend, still preclude us from denominating her our "ancient ally." It. is right, however, to state that, by that treaty, we recognized Turkey as the sovereign of Greece, which a fatal war had enabled her to recover from the Venetians. There were some circumstances, which occurred about that time, which are so very remarkable, that, if your lordship should not consider them quite irrelevant
<image src="S2V0018P0I0015"/>
<col>15</col>
to the matter in debate, I must be permitted to mention. In the year 1718, the governments of England and France were, as now, by the course of events, closely allied together. A dispute arose between the emperor of Germany and the king of Spain, in which they both refused to take any share. On the contrary, they concluded with each other a treaty, of which the object was, to obtain the general pacification of Europe, upon terms to which: they thought it reasonable that both the emperor of Germany and the king of Spain should agree. With this view they agreed with each other, to propose an armistice to the two parties, until the question between them should be settled by the mediation of the great powers of Europe; and they determined to compel by force, if need were, the party who refused such armistice to accede to it. One of the disputants, Germany, acquiesced at once in the proposals of the mediating parties. Spain, however, dissented. She refused to comply with the conditions proposed to her, and went on equipping fleets, raising armies, and executing all those projects which the allied governments of Great Britain and France so much disapproved. Both of them bestirred themselves to dissuade the King of Spain from the course which he was pursuing. The British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of that day, lord Stanhope, travelled in person to Madrid; pointed out to the Spanish government the consequences of the absurd scheme of conquest which it was meditating upon the emperor's dominions in Italy; stated the mischief which would result to humanity from the devastation of that beautiful country; and said, that it was the intention of England to send a powerful squadron into the Mediterranean, to prevent the landing of Spanish troops in any part of Italy. This did not do. A powerful squadron was subsequently sent out by the British government, and the command of it was intrusted to as great and distinguished an officer as the British navy ever possessed; he meant sir George Byng, afterwards lord Torrington. And not the least part of that gallant officer's glory was, that upon that occasion he had dared to do that which sir Edward Codrington had recently done at Navarino; namely, to consider his orders as authorizing him to carry into execution, by the force of the British navy, the great object for which he had been sent into the
<col>16</col>
Mediterranean. When sir George Byng arrived off Cape St. Vincent, he sent his secretary to Madrid, to communicate to the king of Spain, to his prime minister the cardinal Alberoni, and to the Spanish government generally, first of all the amount of his force, and its arrival in those parts; and next, the exact nature of his instructions. He likewise insisted that the Spanish government should give him an answer in eight and forty hours. Cardinal Alberoni, who was then strenuously exerting himself to restore the vigour of a dispirited nation, at first took a high tone, and told him, that his master was determined to run all risks, rather than recal his armaments, or consent to a suspension of arms. The cardinal, however, subsequently laid lord Torrington's letter before the king of Spain, and contrived to lengthen the negotiation from two to nine days. In the mean time, the Spanish troops landed in Sicily Lord Torrington on his arrival at Messina, found, to his great vexation, as sir Edward Codrington found when he arrived off Greece, that the land forces of the king of Spain had arrived at their destination, and that their naval force was anchored close by. What did he do? He immediately sent his own captain with a polite message to the Spanish general the marquis de Lede,&#x2014;as sir Edward Codrington sent his captain to Ibrahim Pacha,&#x2014;proposing a cessation of arms for two months in Sicily, in order that the powers of Europe might have time to concert measures for restoring a lasting peace. He told him that the English and French governments were allied together to establish a general pacification. He therefore proposed to the Spanish general, either to agree to an armistice for two months, or to withdraw his troops altogether from Sicily, in which case he would undertake to convey them in safety to Spain. The Spanish general's answer to this proposition was, that he was an officer, not an ambassador,&#x2014;that he had authority to fight, but no powers to treat,&#x2014;that he was aware of the great power of England and France united; but that he should obey the orders which he had received, and which directed him to reduce Sicily for his master the king of Spain. The Spanish fleet had sailed from the harbour of Messina on the day before the English fleet appeared there; but in consequence of an accident, it was subsequently descried on the coast of Calabria.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0016"/>
<col>17</col>
What was the conduct, my lords, of lord Torrington? Did he look to this word, or that word, of his instructions? No: he looked, as he ought to look, and as I trust every British seaman will look, not to the letter but to the spirit and object of his instructions. He immediately gave chase to the Spanish fleet, brought it to action, and as sir Edward Codrington did at Navarino, attacked and annihilated it. It was stated at the time by lord Torrington, that the Spanish fleet fired first. The Spaniards denied it. I think that, under the circumstances, it was of no consequence whether we fired first or not. They had a right to say, "You came up to me ready for action&#x2014;you came either to intimidate or insult me. Insult is the same thing as aggression, and I had a right to resist your aggression as I best could." Our justification rested upon our right to become the aggressors, if we thought proper; and not upon the casual circumstance of which fleet the first shot came from. All these circumstances are the very circumstances which recently happened at Navarino. The similarity, however, goes still further. It so happened, that at the time when lord Torrington destroyed the Spanish fleet in the gallant manner which I have just described, we had at home a very powerful and exasperated faction of Tories [a laugh]. They had been long, very long, accustomed to the possession and abuse of power, and they were sorely exasperated at the unexpected loss of it. There were also, unfortunately, certain great Whig leaders, who were not a little exasperated at not having been included in the administration which succeeded them. There were also some ex-ministers, who had framed the original treaty with France; and who, after its formation, had had the misfortune to lose the genial influence of the sunshine of power. There were also in the country, what I hope is now quite extinct&#x2014;a set of bigotted <i>jure divino</i> legitimates, who were the secret favourers of Spain, and the avowed defenders of tyranny and arbitrary, hereditary, and undefecated, despotism, in every quarter of the world. All these parties, owing to some strange coincidence of conviction, joined in reprobating the measure which lord Torrington had executed, crying out with loud and angry voices, that it was a gross violation of the sacred principles of the law of nations, and prating very unintelligibly about the fatal and alarming consequences to which it must
<col>18</col>
inevitably lead. Nay, family and traditionary history relates, that there were vague rumours afloat at the time, that the British minister for Foreign Affairs, becoming suddenly afraid of the consequences of the wise, just, and spirited measure, which he had himself recommended, was inclined to throw the odium and responsibility of it on the gallant admiral who had carried it into execution. But, if there was any such intention on his part, which I trust and hope there was not, the administration was rescued from that ignominy by the approbation which the gallant admiral shortly afterwards received from two distinguished royal personages; for George the 1st, admiring the bravery of the achievement, wrote a letter with his own hand to lord Torrington, complimenting him upon it; and the emperor of Germany afterwards did the same. Both those letters are now preserved in the archives of the family; from a laudable pride in the exploit of their illustrious progenitor. These letters state, that the admiral had truly conceived the true spirit of his instructions, and had acted, as British seamen will always act; namely, destroy those who, if preserved, would defeat the object for which the fleet was sent out. With respect to the judgment which posterity has passed upon it, I have a right to observe, that posterity was quite satisfied with it; for it secured for many years the peace of Europe, and saved Italy from the desolation of war. The people of England were also satisfied with it; because the British navy had covered itself with glory in the transaction, and had added another to its former triumphs. And as to the objection&#x2014;I particularly beg the attention of the noble seconder to this observation&#x2014;as to the objection which was made by the minister of Spain, and by the Opposition of England, to its being a violation of the laws of nations, Mr. Secretary Craggs in the House of Commons, and lord Stanhope in the House of Lords,<sup>*</sup> both answered it, by showing the designs which the king of Spain was prepared to carry into execution, and by charging him, in aggravation, with having attacked the emperor of Germany, when he was engaged in a war with the "common enemy of Christendom," the Turk. &#x2014;And this, my lord, brings me back to the question from which I started; namely,
<quote><sup>*</sup> Parl. History, vol. vii&#x2014;pp. 561, 564.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0017"/>
<col>19</col>
the propriety of the Speech from the Throne, styling the Ottoman Porte our "ancient" ally; for the two Secretaries stated, in 1718, that the attack made by Spain upon Germany, when Germany was at war with the Turks, was a species of delinquency which rendered all that had been done justifiable&#x2014;that it was a sort of aggression against, the interests of Christendom and of Europe. Strange language this, my lords, for an old and faithful ally&#x0021; very odd language&#x0021; But it was accidental&#x2014;they were pressed in argument. Mr. Craggs might state this because he was pressed in argument, and did not know what to say; and perhaps lord Stanhope might say this because he could say nothing else; but how does ii happen that another Secretary of State, one of the greatest ornaments this country ever produced, the friend of lord Stanhope, had, three years before, said the same thing? Mr. Addison, who was not only a philosopher, but one of the wisest and best men on the Face of the earth, remarked upon the bad effect of the numerous journalists in this country, and the great spirit of writing and reading politics in the country, and went on to say, that, though there was no absurdity to which people, by this itch for talking and writing politics, might not be brought, he did not believe it possible that there could be persons in England who could think that we were interested in the prosperity of the Ottoman empire. Therefore, after the two political relations we had with Turkey, in one of which we extorted this very Greece from the Turks, we have the declaration of two Secretaries of State, and of another man, afterwards Secretary of State, as to the interest which this country has in Ottoman politics. But, I may be told, "these are old stories: we do not use the word 'ancient' in this kind of sense; we do not attach a great deal of meaning to it." But, what happened afterwards? From that period to the year 1770, I do not know any thing of political Feeling towards the Turks; nor, indeed, until we come to the memorable debate in this House on the affair of Oczakow. A most every man who had held office, and had authority, stated, that the opinion of lord Chatham was, that we should never have any kind of connexion whatever with the Ottoman Porte; and that opinion was fortified during the seven years' war by a similar opinion of the king of Prussia, In 1770
<col>20</col>
our allies, the Russians, sent a great fleet into the Mediterranean, for the purpose of overpowering the Turks. What was the policy of this country? To assist the Russian navy. That fleet was refitted in our harbours, and, with the munitions and implements which it received from us, burnt a Turkish town and fleet, and continued cruising in the Archipelago for no less than five or six years.&#x2014;Then we come to the business of Oczakow. We had an object in preventing Russia from possessing Oczakow. My lords, did Mr. Pitt, in that part of his career&#x2014;which I do not consider the most honourable part of his administration&#x2014;propose an alliance with Turkey? Did he come down and say, "Here is your ancient and faithful ally that is attacked?" Did he say, "Here is a power attacked which we are interested in defending?" No. Mr. Pitt knew well enough&#x2014;he must have kn6wh from his father, there was no sort of alliance between this country and Turkey, and never had been; but he said this, "We have established a new system in Europe"&#x2014;and he prided himself upon it&#x2014;"Prussia forms a main part of that system, and, for the interest of Prussia, we must prevent the proposed aggression of Russia upon Turkey." My lords, Mr. Pitt was hot the only person who used this language at that time; but I defy any of your lordship's to show that Mr. Pitt, or any of his friends, ever spoke of Turkey at that time as bur "ancient ally." There is another individual, nearly connected with myself, whose sentiments upon that occasion I will not&#x2014;nay, I dare not&#x2014;trust myself with mentioning to your lordships. They are, however, well known, and will not be forgotten. Mr. Burke, too, speaking on the same subject, after the French Revolution had disappointed the lovers of rational freedom, and had kindled in his breast a pious horror of deserting ancient allies and ancient institutions&#x2014;Mr. Burke, speaking, as he always did speak, like a man of genius and knowledge&#x2014;what did Mr. Burke say about our ancient and faithful ally the Turk? His words, my lords, were these&#x2014;"I have never before heard it held forth, that the Turkish empire has ever been considered as any part of the balance of power in Europe. They had nothing to do with European power; they considered themselves as wholly Asiatic. Where is the Turkish resident at our court, the court

of Prussia, or of Holland? They despise and contemn all Christian princes, as infidels, and only wish to subdue and exterminate them and their people. What have these worse than savages to do with the powers of Europe, but to spread war, destruction, and pestilence amongst them? The ministers and the policy which shall give these people any weight in Europe, will deserve all the bans and curses of posterity." Very strange language this in an English House of Commons, regarding an ancient and faithful ally&#x0021; But let us see how this mighty master proceeds.&#x2014;"All that is holy in religion, all that is moral and humane, demands an abhorrence of every thing which tends to extend the power of that cruel and wasteful empire. Any Christian power is to be preferred to these destructive savages."<sup>*</sup> I do not mean to say that I approve of the sentiments here expressed. I do hot quote them as rules for the guidance of your lordships; but I bring them, if the learned lord on the woolsack will permit me to use such a phrase, as evidence to the fact, and for the purpose of showing that the Turk was not considered by public men as the ancient ally of Great Britain. I may even add, that on the accession of George 1st, to the throne of this kingdom, it was urged by the courtiers of that day as a strong argument in his favour, that he had fleshed his maiden sword in Greece against the Turks&#x2014;a pregnant proof, by the bye, that the Turk was not at that time considered as the ally of Great Britain.&#x2014;I now come, my lords, to the first alliance really made with Turkey by this country. What was that alliance? It was an alliance formed in my time, in the year 1798 or 1799, in consequence of the invasion of Egypt by the French, who have often been reproached with being, though they never acknowledged that they were, the ancient ally of the Turks. It has been a reproach to the French nation that they were an ancient ally of the Ottoman empire. When they invaded Egypt, and not before, we entered into a treaty of alliance with the Porte. My lords, I have looked into that treaty this very evening, and I am surprised to find that, so far from its being a treaty of alliance formed for the mutual interests of Turkey and England as against the rest of the world, or as connected with commerce. &#x2014;So far from being a treaty of alliance,
<quote><sup>*</sup> Parl. History, v. xxix, p. 76.</quote>
<col>22</col>
formed for the protection of the Turkish empire against its immediate invaders, it is a treaty of alliance, at the invitation of an old and natural ally, the emperor of Russia, to enter, for the first time, into Sri alliance with the Turk. The words of the first article die as follow:&#x2014;"His Britannic majesty, connected already with his majesty the emperor of Russia by the ties of the strictest alliance, accedes by the present treaty, to the defensive alliance, which, had just been concluded between his majesty the Ottoman emperor and the emperor of Russia, as far as the stipulations thereof are applicable to the local circumstances of his empire, and that of the Sublime Porte." So that all the alliance which we then made with the Sublime Porte, was made through the intervention, and at the express request, of Russia. Now, at the end of that treaty it is said, that notwithstanding the two high contracting parties are desirous to maintain it in force for ever, or at least as long as possible, it appeared most expedient to limit it at that time for seven years, to be computed from the day of the ratifications being exchanged. Strange to say, long before those seven years had elapsed, Turkey had broken all the main articles of that treaty which bound, it to remain at peace with Russia. We had a right to remonstrate, and we did remonstrate, against the conduct which it followed. It broke them, too, in as far as they related to us; for they had bound themselves to have no friends that were not our friends, and to enter into no relations with those who declared themselves our enemies. Many of your lordships must be aware, that long before the year 1807, we had occasion to remonstrate against the great influence which general Sebastiani, an agent of the emperor Napoleon, had assumed in the divan. That of itself would have been a legitimate ground of war. We refrained, however, as long as we justly could from hostilities with the Ottoman Porte; but three months had not passed after the expiration of the treaty, before we were obliged to send a fleet to Constantinople, to enforce Out opinion, and to bring them to reason; that is to say, by compelling the performance of the articles of the treaty with Russia. &#x2014;Then, my lords, I do say, that I have proved to your lordships that Turkey h neither an ancient nor a faithful ally. Since that time no alliance has been made: we have preserved the relations of peace

and amity, but we have done no more. We have undoubtedly obtained a recognition, under the treaty, of those rights which had been granted as a boon so far back as the time of Charles 2nd. I do not wish to go at present into the general question of the justice or policy of the proceeding of this country on the subject. I do hope that those who framed the Speech are satisfied with themselves: for myself, I am convinced that it is much more convenient to the House, and much more respectful towards his majesty, to defer any decision until all the papers are before the House. I only lament there is another word in the Speech from the throne to which I do not know what meaning to attach. I certainly hope that the two noble lords who have spoken will leave the word out of the address, or give us some explanation of it. I allude to the word "untoward." If it is meant, by "untoward," that any blame is to be cast on the gallant officer who commanded the fleet at Navarino, I must say that against the baseness and ignominy of such an insinuation I would protest in the most solemn way. In Johnson's Dictionary the meaning is "froward, perverse, vexatious." If we are to understand from the word "untoward," that it refers to that which happened by accident, and which stood across the object which we had in view&#x2014;if that be the meaning of it, I must also protest against it. However much I may lament the effusion of blood which has taken place at Navarino&#x2014;however much I may lament that we have not yet accomplished so great an object as the pacification of two contending countries, and the liberation of Greece&#x2014;that country from which we derived no small portion of all those virtues which exalt and dignify our nature, and to which we owe all that gives life and animation to our debates&#x2014;however much I may mourn over the deferred hopes of a brave and gallant people&#x2014;still if by that word it is meant to say, that the battle of Navarino is an obstacle to the independence of Greece, I cannot agree to its justice. I think it has furthered and promoted it. I look upon it as a step, and a great step, towards the pacification of Europe: and consider it of more use than a contrary policy could have been, in promoting that great and desirable object. I defer the discussion on the other parts of this subject to a future opportunity. All I wish at present to prove is, that those who have
<col>24</col>
framed the Treaties to which the Speech refers, and the great officers who have been intrusted with the execution of them will not be considered in so doing to have deserted either the ancient ally or the ancient policy of Great Britain; and that if, in the course of their career, they have pursued an object great and glorious to the country, and have not completely succeeded in attaining it, they will receive the praise of their countrymen for what they have effected, and not their censure for what they have found it impossible to execute.&#x2014;The noble lord sat down amidst loud cheers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00031"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> said, that before their lordships separated, he wished to offer a word or two on a very homely subject, of which, he was sorry to see there was no mention either in the Speech from the Throne or in the Address, though it had occupied no inconsiderable portion of their lordships' time during the last session. He meant the Corn-laws. Now, that subject appeared to him to be a more difficult subject for the administration even than the battle of Navarino. It would be a grievous question to any administration, and it would not be less so to the present, seeing that there were in it two or three avowed friends, two or three decided enemies, and&#x2014;what was, perhaps, more dangerous than all, two or three concealed enemies to the Corn-laws. As there were in the present administration some persons who had been in the last administration, and in the administration before the last, and who most probably would also be found in the next administration, it was to be hoped, that while they were busy in making terms, and no doubt good terms, for themselves, they had not forgotten to make equally good terms for their own principles of free trade, and for a new Corn-law. He would, however, ask what security the country had upon the point? It was said, that the country had the same President of the Board of Trade that it had before. Now, he thought that the country would have a much better security, if the noble duke at the head of the government, who had the whole substantial power&#x2014;who had not only the common and ordinary powers of prime minister, but had concentrated in himself the civil and military power&#x2014;was known to entertain views favourable to free trade, and to the subject to which he alluded; but when he recollected the noble duke's conduct last year,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0020"/>
<col>25</col>
he thought it a most inadequate security merely to have the continuance of the same person who, for a few months, had occupied the place of President of the Board of Trade. The country had been told, that it had obtained security that the foreign policy of the former administration would not be departed from, seeing that it had the same Foreign Secretary still in office. Now, he considered that security not a whit better than the security they had obtained on the other question: he believed that both those personages were mere satellites of the person at the head of the government, and must necessarily be drawn into his vortex. The old saying, that "there was a power behind the Throne greater than the Throne itself," seemed to be totally reversed; for there semed to be a power before the Throne more formidable than the Throne itself. He should be happy if the securities turned out better than he expected. He should be delighted to give his support to any measures of free trade, which, it was said, certain persons had secured, and should be greatly disappointed if they were not carried into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00032"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;My lords, if there be any one subject more than another, on which the country is agreed as one man, it is, that there should be a complete settlement of the Corn question. I have, therefore, very great pleasure in being enabled to inform your lordships, that it is the intention of his majesty's government, at an early period of the present session, to submit to the consideration of parliament a measure relative to the Corn-laws, and for regulating the importation of corn, founded upon the principle of the measure which was introduced last session. Having thus been under the necessity of addressing your lordships, in answer to the question put to me by the noble baron, I hope I may be permitted to say a few words in answer to what fell from the noble lord who addressed the House just now. First, with regard to the term "ancient ally," I must state that the Ottoman power has long been an ally of this country; that the Ottoman power is an essential part of the balance of power in Europe; that the preservation of the Ottoman power has been, for a considerable number of years, an object, not only to this country, but to the whole of Europe; and that the revolutions which have occurred, the changes of possession which
<col>26</col>
have taken place in that part of the world, render the preservation of the Ottoman power as an independent power, capable of defending itself, an essential object. My lords, I would likewise say, that not only has the preservation of that power been an object to this country, but it has likewise been an essential object to Russia. I believe I may safely say that, had it not been for the influence of the councils of this country over the Ottoman power during the late war, the disaster which finally led to the establishment of Europe in the state in which it is now found would not have occurred to the extent to which it did occur in the year 1812. Under these circumstances, although the word "ancient ally" will not apply to an alliance by treaties of a hundred years standing, yet there is no doubt whatever that the Ottoman power has been an ally of this country, and certainly an old ally. My lords, there is another term made use of by his majesty in his Speech, and in the Address, I mean the term "untoward event." My lords, the sense in which untoward is used is this. Under the treaty, which has not yet been laid before the House, and which cannot come regularly under discussion until it has been so laid, but which we have all read, it is particularly stated, as one of the stipulations of the alliance, that the operation of the treaty was not to lead to hostilities, and that the contracting powers were to take no part in hostilities. Therefore, my lords, I say, that when, unfortunately, the operations under the treaty did lead to hostilities, it was an untoward circumstance. My lords, it was hoped and expected, I believe, by the former government, that this object would be effected without hostilities. I believe it, not only from the treaty itself, but I believe it because the force they provided to carry the measure into execution was such as to render it almost impossible that there should be hostilities. That being the case, I say that when these hostilities unfortunately took place, that when the course of the measures of the late government assumed the character of hostilities, instead of that of peace, it was an untoward event. I say, also, that understanding there was some chance&#x2014;some prospect&#x2014;after the account of this event had reached Constantinople, that it might have ended in war, that that was an untoward event. His majesty now tells us, that these chances have disappeared; he hopes that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0021"/>
<col>27</col>
this event will no longer be an impediment to the amicable adjustment of the existing differences between the Porte and the Greeks; out, nevertheless, that does not at all deprive the event of its character of "untoward." The noble baron opposite has said, "Do you mean to make a charge against your naval commander?" Certainly not. No man has a right to make a charge against him. His majesty and his life government, who have had the gallant admirals conduct under their consideration, have wholly acquitted him of blame; and I certainly have no right to come forward and say that the gallant admiral has done otherwise than his duty to his king and his country. I will say, that the gallant admiral was placed in a very delicate and peculiar situation. He was in command of a squadron of ships, acting in conjunction with admirals of other nations, and he so conducted himself as to acquire their confidence, and to induce them to allow him to lead them to victory. Feeling this to be the case, I should feel myself unworthy of the high situation which hold in his majesty's councils if I were capable of uttering; a single word against the gallant admiral. Meaning, as I did, that the government should carry the Treaty fairly into execution, it would be highly blamable in me to insinuate a censure against the man who was charged with the execution of difficult orders under that Treaty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00033"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> expresssed a hope that, in the arduous situation in which the country was at present placed, no impediment would be thrown in the way of the government, in their efforts for the preservation of the peace of Europe. It could hardly be said, that there had been an administration in the country for the last nine months. It could hardly be said that there had been a parliament in the country which had either considered or done any thing for the same period. Under these circumstances, it was high time to look to the most pressing object of British interests,&#x2014;the preservation of the peace of Europe. He did not mean to enter into the consideration of the treaties which had been alluded to, seeing that they were not at present before their lordships. If, however, he understood the meaning of those treaties, as he had read them in various publications, one of them aimed at the preserving of peace, and the other provided that hostilities should not be committed. Yet, in the
<col>28</col>
face, of those treaties, that had taken place which might assuredly be called an untoward event. Let him not be misunderstood. God forbid that he should throw any blame on the gallant admiral to whom reference had been made&#x0021; No person, knowing the difficult situation in which the gallant officer was placed, could, without being acquainted with all the circumstances of the case, venture to say whether he had acted rightly or wrongly. Still, he could not avoid observing that, in one sense, the battle of Navarino was an untoward event. When he considered the actual situation of the country, with reference to the interests pf agriculture, trade, and finance, there was in his opinion no one object which could be put in competition with the necessity of gating every step, consistently with the honour of a great country, to bring about peace. He should give his hearty support to the Address.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00034"><member>The Marquis of Londonderry</member><membercontribution> said, that the last time he had spoken in that House, he had expressed his disapprobation of an unnatural alliance, which he had prophecied would soon dwindle away. A noble lord opposite had then made a very ingenious remark; but he would now ask him, whether recent events had not completely fulfilled his prophecy? He rejoiced at the change which had taken place. He trusted that, under the new administration, the country would be placed on a high and commanding situation. The name of the illustrious individual at the head of the government carried great weight with it throughout Europe. In no transaction of his public life had he failed. Indeed, he seemed to have been born under a star which insured him success. Now that his noble friend was at the head of the national councils, he was persuaded the interests of the country, both at home and abroad, would be managed in such a way, as would again raise England to that proud preeminence from which she had declined during the last year. The noble earl opposite (Grey), than whom no man stood higher in the public opinion on account of his rare consistency and noble disinterestedness, particularly during the events of the last year, had said, that a want of confidence in the person at the head of government was a fair ground of opposition to his administration. He would take the proposition in its converse sense, and say, that his unbounded confidence in the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0022"/>
<col>29</col>
present premier would induce him to give his entire support, without reference to minor points. He knew that the noble duke at the head of the government was incapable of allowing any disunion to exist in his cabinet. Should any part of it be affected by the dry-rot, he would at once cut it off. And if that was a reason for others to support the noble duke's administration, how much stronger must it not be with him, who had for twenty years served side by side, with that great man, in whom he had, never seen any thing but what ought to be esteemed and admired. He said these words honestly and fairly before him; as, since his noble friend had come into his present situation, he had had no other opportunity of testifying his satisfaction at his appointment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00035"><member>Earl Grey</member><membercontribution> said, that the noble marquis had been pleased to speak of him in a very kind and much too flattering manner. He rose now merely for the purpose of stating distinctly, what he had said on a former occasion, to which the noble marquis had alluded, and which did not bear the interpretation that the noble marquis had put upon it. The noble marquis had stated, that he (earl Grey) had said, that a want of confidence in the head of the administration was a just ground of opposition to the administration. Now, he did not recollect that he had given expression to such a sentiment. He did undoubtedly say, that a want of confidence in the head of the administration was a just, nay, the best ground for any man refusing his accession to it. He had said, further, that a want of confidence, not in the head only of an administration&#x2014;for it was not a personal objection that had actuated him in his conduct last year, it was an objection to the general principle on which the administration was composed&#x2014;but a want of confidence in an administration generally, was an effectual bar to a pledge of general support. That was the situation in which he found himself placed last year. He did not see in the composition of the cabinet such an assurance for the prosecution of measures and principles which he considered essential to the good government and prosperity of the country, as would induce him to give it his general support; and on those grounds he withheld his support, although some members of that administration were persons entitled, in the fullest extent, to his confidence. At the same time, however,
<col>30</col>
he had stated, that he would not support&#x2014;certainly, that he would not be reckoned a member of&#x2014;any opposition which might be formed against that administration. Such was his situation last year; and in a similar situation, he still found himself. He went the full length of respect noble marquis in the tribute, of respect which he had paid to the noble duke at the head of the government. It was hardly possible that any person could feel' more warm admiration towards that distinguished individual than he did; but in the composition of the administration there were defects which rendered it impossible that he could give it his general countenance. Nothing could make him happier than to find, as occasions occurred, that the measures of the administration would be of such a nature as to entitle them to his support; but, under present circumstances, he must stand aloof, supporting the measures of government when they seemed to be for the advantage of the country, and opposing them, however reluctantly, when he could not conscientiously believe them to be of that description. Having now said more, perhaps, than enough in explanation of the conduct of a person of so little consequence as himself, he would make a few observations upon what had occurred that evening. He agreed with the learned lord who spoke from the cross-bench, in considering the battle of Navarino a most untoward event. He was not disposed, from any knowledge which he had of the circumstances of the case, to impute blame to the gallant officer who had commanded upon that occasion. He had long been acquainted with sir Edward Codrington, and could undertake to assert, that a better, a braver, or a more skilful, officer did not exist. He agreed with the noble duke, that it would be extremely unjust to look with too critical an eye at the conduct of an officer placed in such difficult circumstances as sir Edward had been, and who had exerted himself to support what he believed to be the true interest and honour of his country. It was with the greatest satisfaction he had heard from the noble duke, that whatever word might be employed in the royal Speech, whether "untoward" or any thing else&#x2014;no intention existed of throwing any imputation on the conduct of that gallant officer. With respect to the transaction I itself, he concurred with the learned lord in thinking it most unfortunate. That the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0023"/>
<col>31</col>
effect which was naturally to be expected from such an event might be averted, he sincerely trusted; and the generally pacific tone of the royal Speech increased his hopes on this head. His noble friend behind him (lord Holland), who had addressed the House with his usual acuteness, and had displayed a considerable extent of information, had, in the course of a speech, which he must think his noble friend had better have reserved until the subject should come under discussion, instituted a parallel between the battle of Navarino, and an event which had occurred in the early part of the last century under sir George Byng. He suspected that, when the two cases came to be carefully examined, considerable points of distinction would be found to exist between them. Upon this topic, however, he would anticipate nothing. Whatever impression he might have on the subject, he felt it to be becoming, and indeed absolutely necessary, to reserve the expression of his opinions, until the requisite information should be laid before their lordships. When the period to which he alluded arrived, he should be prepared to state fearlessly, and without reference to any party interests, his opinion upon the subject. Before he sat down, he desired to say one word upon another topic. A noble friend of his had put a question with respect to an omission in the royal Speech, and the noble duke had stated in reply, that it was the intention of government to introduce a bill respecting the trade in corn, founded upon the principle of the bill of last session. He had voted for that bill on the second reading, and therefore could have no objection to the introduction of a bill on the same principle. Now, he objected to some of the regulations of the bill of last session, and thought, besides, that it might be improved; and therefore, if a bill precisely similar, should be introduced, it would, in his opinion, require amendment. What he was anxious to do was, to direct the attention of the House to the fact, that the noble duke had stated only that a bill would be introduced founded on the same principles as that of last year; but not that the same bill would be introduced. Unless this point were explained, the noble duke's answer might possibly be misconstrued.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00036"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> said, that the noble earl had rightly understood him. What he had stated was, that a bill would

<p id="S2V0018P0-00037"><member>The Earl of Darnley</member> moved, that the words, "ancient ally," in the Address, be omitted, and the words "a country at peace and amity with us" be substituted for them.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00038"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution> begged to ask the noble duke at the head of the government, whether he retained the office of commander-in-chief of the forces?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00039"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> replied, that when he received his majesty's commands to form an Administration, he felt great reluctance to place himself at the head of it. Finding, however, that it was the unanimous opinion of his colleagues, that he ought to occupy that situation, and finding also that, under the circumstances, it was not easy to find a person to fill the office which he now had the honour to hold, he determined to resign the office of commander in chief.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00040"><member>The Marquis of Lansdowne</member><membercontribution> said, he did not rise with the intention of offering the slightest objection to the Address, which it was his ardent wish to see unanimously carried; but, after what had been stated in the course of the discussion, having recently been honoured with an office in a situation in his majesty's government, he felt himself called upon to declare, that there was no one act of that government, but more especially no one of its acts connected with the transactions which had been the subject of that night's conversation, that he would not consider himself bound to defend. He could assure his noble friend at the head of the foreign department, who immediately represented the person at the head of that department before him; whose dying instructions he received; and whose intentions he was expected to fulfil; that whenever he should be called upon to defend the whole of that system of which he was the representative, from whatever side of the House the attack might proceed, he would find in him a sincere and zealous, though perhaps a useless, supporter. He felt confident, that even though his noble friend should not be able to do so, he himself could satisfy the House of the sound principles on which the negotiations had proceeded. He could also satisfy the House and the country, that no danger of war had been unnecessarily incurred by his majesty's ministers. He was not only
<image src="S2V0018P0I0024"/>
<col>33</col>
bound to make this declaration, but he felt it his duty to say, in relation to the recent conflict, that if any blame did attach any where, most assuredly it was not on the gallant officer who commanded the fleet. He agreed with the noble duke opposite, and with other noble lords who had spoken, that the battle of Navarino was an unfortunate circumstance, inasmuch as it occasioned the destruction of life, and tended to lead to those unhappy consequences, which always contributed to alienate friendly powers, and to set them in something like interminable hostility with each other; but, at the same time, he should be ashamed if he did not declare that it would be childish to expect that when an armed interference had been determined on by treaty, it could take place without the risk of war. He agreed with the noble duke in thinking, that war should not take place, if the objects of the intervention could be effected without it; but the consequences of opposition must have been foreseen by those who framed the protocol and the treaty of London. There was no meaning in establishing a hostile intervention unless we were prepared to encounter all the consequences which must result from it, melancholy as they might be. He hoped his majesty's ministers would be able to prove that no blame rested any where; but that the conduct of our commander at Navarino was part of the policy which he had not heard, in the course of that night's debate, it was intended to change; but, if ministers entertained any such intention, he hoped they would have the manliness to avow it. If, however, blame rested any where, it would be easy to prove that it did not rest with the gallant individual who had been so frequently alluded to, and never without praise and honour, but with those who concluded the treaties that had placed him in the situation in which he appeared to have exercised a sound discretion, with reference to his sense of duty. Although he was anxious that the Address should be carried without opposition, he could not have given it his support without the explanation from the noble duke with respect to the term "untoward," as applied to that gallant commander who had presided over the allied fleets during the conflict. When the documents should be laid before their lordships, it would appear that the gallant officer was intrusted with a necessarily large, but well and fairly-exercised,
<col>34</col>
discretion. He hoped that, in justice to the gallant admiral, all the documents possible would be produced. On the intelligence of the affair at Navarino reaching this country, it was found that further information was wanting. That information was supplied; and being supplied, it was seen that the gallant admiral was entitled to the warm approbation of the government and of the country. It was not incumbent on him to say more upon the present occasion. With respect to other events, he was prepared to give the fullest explanation when called upon. He had risen merely to enter his protest on behalf of a gallant individual, who was entitled to the protection, not of his friends alone, but of every individual who possessed a particle of British honour.</membercontribution></p>

Whenever the time should arrive for discussing the course of policy in which he had had a share, he should be prepared to express his sentiments with the same fearlessness with which he now addressed their lordships; and he concurred with his noble friend in believing, that it would not be difficult to prove, that there was nothing in that policy, or in the particular transaction growing out of it, inconsistent with the honour of the country or its best interests. He entirely concurred in all that had been, said respecting the conduct of sir Edward Codrington. In his opinion he had exercised a sound discretion. He was placed in circumstances of no ordinary difficulty, and he had discharged his duty with consummate skill and courage. He was prepared to support the gallant admiral, not only on the principle that it was the duty of a government to support those who executed their orders, but from a deliberate conviction that he was justified, under the circumstances, in the course which he had taken, and that in taking that course he had neither tarnished his own previously acquired fame, nor sullied the honour and glory of his country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ADDRESS ON THE KING'S SPEECH.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00047">The Speaker acquainted the House, that the House had been in the House of Lords, to hear the Speech of the Lords Commissioners, of which, to prevent mistakes, he had obtained a copy. After he had read it to the House,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00048"><member>The Hon. Cecil Jenkinson</member><membercontribution> said: &#x2014;In rising, Sir, on the present occasion, to move, that an humble Address be presented to his Majesty, I must observe, in the outset, that no degree of confidence in my own powers has placed me in this situation: on the contrary, there is no man mere diffident of himself, and with reason, than I am. I am not, indeed, a young member, but I have troubled the House very seldom upon any subject pf discussion that has come before it. Having mentioned this circumstance, may add, that, as long as a person&#x2014;to whom I can hardly allude without an emotion which deprives me of the little power I have pf expressing myself&#x2014;as long as that person, I mean my noble brother, was not
<col>36</col>
only at the head of the councils of his Sovereign, but in a situation of most exalted estimation with the with country, it was needless for me to trouble the House with my own private opinions; for on all public matters they were invariably in accordance with those which he was so well able to declare. He possessed a faculty to which I have no pretensions: he had elequence to describe every feeling and impulse in his comprehensive mind&#x2014;a mind so comprehensive, that it embraced every thing calculated to increase the greatness or promote the welfare of his, country. I only touch lightly upon this subject, because I cannot but feel the strongest emotions whenever my mind is turned to the present situation of my poor brother [hear&#x0021;]. Knowing, as I do, however, that since his unfortunate malady, as often as his attention has been directed that way, he has felt and expressed the greatest anxiety for the continued glory and prosperity of his country, I could not refrain from stating thus much.&#x2014;I would also advert cursorily to another event deeply to be regretted, which has occurred since the melancholy incapability of lord Liverpool. I allude to the death pf a man of the greatest eloquence&#x2014;a statesman to whom I have often listened with the highest admiration; for whom I am confident my brother, both from early connection and warm admiration of his talents, had the strongest regard; and with whom he had formed an early and roost intimate friendship, founded upon mutual esteem. I never shall forget the effect produced by that right hon. gentleman's commanding eloquence; and, in my feeble way, and in the only mode in which I am capable of stating it, I must express of it my profound admiration. But he is no more&#x2014;still more completely so than my poor brother; and Providence having disposed of these two great men&#x2014;I hope I may in justice be allowed to call my brother great, as well as the late Mr. Canning&#x2014;every body looked with anxiety to the establishment of a new Administration, which should embody all the sentiments, and receive all that approbation, which I believe generally characterized and followed my brother's government, through a long series of years [hear&#x0021;]. Upon this part of the subject I hope I have not trespassed too far. I hope I have not pressed my ideas of the respect entertained for lord Liverpool beyond what it will bear. I am aware that it is a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0026"/>
<col>37</col>
very delicate matter for me to state my respect and veneration for one so near and clear to me, without requiring too much of the patience of the House.&#x2014;Leaving, therefore, personal questions, I way observe, after being perfectly possessed of every circumstance, I am convinced that lord Liverpool concurs in the formation of that A4ramistratipn, the new writs for various members of which have been moved this very clay. He is satisfied with the principles on which it is founded, and is persuaded that it embodies all the interest to which he was so long and so dearly attached. He approves it as containing many of, if not all, the distinguished persons with whom he was himself closely connected; but, if there be one circumstance of satisfaction more prominent than another, it is that which I may fitly notice; namely, the re-admission of the right hon. the late member of the University of Oxford. A near and dear connection long subsisted between that individual and my noble brother, and his services will be particularly acceptable to the country, as Secretary of State for the Home Department. That right hon. gentleman was introduced into public life by lord Liverpool, and was, in the first instance, Under Secretary in the very office over which he now presides. From the commencement of their acquaintance the most unbounded confidence and concurrence upon every political question have existed between them. With this feeling, and under this persuasion, I am not wrong, I think, in supposing, in the general sense, that lord Liverpool highly approves of the Administration just formed; and I beg distinctly to state, that in making my appearance before the House on the present occasion, I am warranted by the approbation and authority of my noble brother. I wish it, nevertheless, to be clearly understood, that my own inclination has solely prompted me to come forward. It was my own proposition that I should move the Address; and if in what 1 have said, I have let fall any thing objectionable, or that may be unpleasant or ungrateful to the feelings of any hon. member, I beg leave to express my regret at the circumstance. I hope I have guarded myself, and that I have not been guilty of any presumptuousness in what I have offered respecting my brother or myself. I introduce myself, at the present moment, from a sense of public duty, and
<col>38</col>
only at my own suggestion.&#x2014;Having thus prepared my way, I shall only offer a few words upon the Address, with which I shall conclude; as there are few topics in the Speech from the Throne which will not meet, with the full concurrence of the House. As to the struggle in Greece and in the Greek Islands, it must be evident to all who consider the subject, that it was impossible such violations of the laws of humanity and neutrality could be allowed to continue, without an interference. But the period for examination into all the circumstances of the case has not yet arrived. The opinion which the House shall form must, of course, depend upon what may appear in the papers which his majesty has signified his intention of laying before the House. The Address which I shall have the honour of moving, will pledge the House to nothing but a grateful expression of feeling towards his majesty, for the promised production of the papers, without giving the slightest measure of approbation. The mention in the Speech of the battle of Navarin evidently calls for the expression of no opinion on the part of the House. If discussion arise upon it, it should follow an inquiry into all the circumstances of the case; and, until the papers are laid upon the table, it would be premature and fruitless to debate the question. My personal regard for the gallant officer who commanded the British squadron makes me wish to say a few words in his praise; and having myself, early in life, belonged to the same noble profession, no man feels more strongly than I do the gallant manner in which that important service was executed. Upon that point there can be no dispute, and, therefore, no discussion; indeed, if there were any danger of the kind, I should be the last man to provoke it. With regard to the conduct of this country towards Portugal, there will, I apprehend, be as little difference of opinion. The sending out of the troops was debated before they were despatched; and I was one of those who had the pleasure of hearing the eloquent personage I have before mentioned more than once in defence of that measure. It now appears that the troops are about to be recalled; and to this arrangement, certainly, no man is likely to object. The Treaties with Brazil and Mexico must be considered as the earnest of future advantage to this country: the extent of that advantage must, of course, depend upon
<image src="S2V0018P0I0027"/>
<col>39</col>
circumstances; but, at all events, the documents are evidence of the efforts of the British government to extend the trade and augment the commercial prosperity of the country.&#x2014;Another, and an important, topic in the Speech relates to the examination of the receipts and expenditure of the empire; and upon it I beg to be allowed to say only a few words. In adverting to the momentous subject in the trifling and imperfect way in which I must do it, I beg to state my perfect and firm conviction, that this country, in itself, possesses resources which&#x2014;if administered with wisdom, and assisted and improved by that unbounded confidence which is due by a nation to a government vested in the hands of persons who have been long tried and are known to be worthy of such confidence&#x2014;are capable of extricating it from any difficulties, however formidable. Let the House look back at the circumstances which have occurred in the past history of the country. Let them look to the period of the war of the Succession. Do they not prove that there is in the nation a power of revivification, or of internal restoration, from the most depressing circumstances. I will not insist upon these details, since they are, no doubt, much more familiar to the House than to myself. But I will say, that the greatest glory which could mark the career of any ministry would be, to accomplish such a restoration of national prosperity and strength. That glory belonged, in a peculiar degree, to sir Robert Walpole, who restored the finances of the country to a state of prosperity, after the depressing effects of the wars of king William and of the Succession. The debts which were then incurred undoubtedly cannot be compared with the debt incurred at a more recent period; but, in a certain degree, they are comparable, and the circumstance fully warrants the conclusion, that this country, through the elasticity of its resources, will again rise to a prosperous and happy condition. Such an achievement, I repeat, would confer the greatest glory upon any ministry. I am not the man who would under-rate the glories which encircle the name of Pitt. I am not the person to undervalue the result of that illustrious statesman's exertions in preserving this country from the effects of the revolutionary mania which then threatened desolation to Europe: but I conceive that the brightest glory which crowned the
<col>40</col>
fame of that great man was the circumstance of his having restored the finances of this country, after the great depression produced in them by the American war, to a state of the highest prosperity. There are many circumstances, at present, which weigh heavily upon the national prosperity; and, amongst them, there are none, in my opinion, more formidable than the many changes which have taken place in the value of property. When I talk of the pressure arising out of the late war, I know perfectly well that it is now fourteen or fifteen years since peace was concluded; but the variation in the value of property has been banefully operating during the whole of that period. I am aware that I may talk ignorantly upon a subject of this sort; but what I advance is my honest conviction, and that is the best excuse I can make for offering it to the House. In the variations in the value of property, we must look for the cause of the depression; and, until those variations are adjudicated, it is vain to expect prosperity in the financial condition of the country. I know well that, in time, that happy result will be obtained, and that the growing resources of the country will not alone extricate it from its present difficulties, but, looking at those resources, I confidently predict, that still greater prosperity is in store for us. On this subject it is my most anxious and ardent wish, that the various interests should feel the necessity of conciliating and co-operating with each other. Each has an essential dependence upon the others, and none can subsist opposed to or detached from the rest. For my own part, I have, for many years, been connected with, and wholly dependant upon, the agricultural interest; and am firmly assured, that nothing but a complete fraternity of feeling between the commercial and manufacturing interests, can possibly effect any of those purposes which the most sanguine may contemplate. I, therefore, exhort the House, as the representative of those different interests, and combining in itself the elements of which each is composed, to adopt those conciliatory and comprehensive measures by which the joint benefit of all classes can be achieved, and the distress of each, as far as possible, alleviated; and to endeavour to accomplish these most desirable objects, not by any false and partial view, not by any niggardly catching at what may appear to be the separate interest of any one particular body whom they may individually repre-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0028"/>
<col>41</col>
sent, but by the consolidation of the joint and only true interests of all.&#x2014;These, Sir, are the views which I have formed of the line of policy that ought to be adopted. I fear that, in the few observations with which I have troubled the House, something may have escaped me which may expose me to ridicule, or perhaps contempt. But I am conscious of the rectitude of my sentiments. I have, therefore, given expression to them, feeling it a duty to lend my humble and feeble aid to second the voice of the House, and, as I confidently trust, of the country, in pronouncing the present administration worthy of public confidence. Having described, as shortly as possible, and as well as I am able, the feelings which I entertain, and the motives by which I am actuated, I shall conclude with moving,
<quote>"That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty&#x2014;to return his Majesty our humble thanks for the gracious Speech which his Majesty has directed to be delivered by the Lords Commissioners.</quote>
<quote>"To assure his Majesty, that we feel the greatest satisfaction in learning that his Majesty continues to receive from all foreign princes and states, assurances of their desire to maintain the relations of amity with this country; and that the great powers of Europe participate in the earnest wish of his Majesty, to cultivate a good understanding upon all points which may conduce to the preservation of peace.</quote>
<quote>"To express to his Majesty our deep regret that the state of affairs in the East of Europe should have been the subject of great concern to his Majesty; and that a contest should have been so long carried on between the Ottoman Porte and the inhabitants of the Greek Provinces and Islands, which has been marked on each side by excesses revolting to humanity.</quote>
<quote>"To assure his Majesty, that our regret is increased by learning, that in the progress of that contest, the rights of neutral states, and the laws which regulate the intercourse of civilized nations, have been repeatedly violated, and the peaceful commerce of his Majesty's subjects has been exposed to frequent interruption, and to depredations, too often aggravated by acts of violence and atrocity.</quote>
<quote>"To assure his Majesty, that we participate in the deep anxiety felt by his Majesty, to terminate the calamities, and avert the dangers, inseparable from hostilities, which constitute the only exception to the general tranquillity of Europe.</quote>
<col>42</col>
<quote>"Humbly to thank his Majesty for the I communication which he has made to us, that his Majesty having been earnestly entreated by the Greeks to interpose his good offices, with a view to effect a reconciliation between them and the Ottoman Porte, had concerted measures for that purpose in the first instance with the emperor of Russia, and subsequently with his Imperial Majesty and the king of France.</quote>
<quote>"And also for the directions which his Majesty has been pleased to give, that there should be laid before us copies of a Protocol, signed at St. Petersburgh by the Plenipotentiaries of his Majesty and of his Imperial Majesty the emperor of Russia, on the 4th of April, 1826, and of the Treaty entered into between his Majesty and the Courts of the Tuileries and of St. Petersburgh, on the 6th of July, 1827.</quote>
<quote>"To thank his Majesty, for having informed us, that in the course of the measures adopted with a view to carry into effect the object of the Treaty, a collision, wholly unexpected by his Majesty, took place in the Port of Navarin, between the fleets of the contracting powers and that of the Ottoman Porte.</quote>
<quote>"To assure his Majesty, that we participate in the regret expressed by his Majesty, notwithstanding the valour displayed by the combined fleet, that a conflict should have occurred with the naval force of an ancient ally, and that we rejoice to learn that his Majesty still entertains a confident hope that this untoward event will not be followed by further hostilities, and will not impede that amicable adjustment of the existing differences between the Porte and the Greeks, to which it is so manifestly their common interest to accede.</quote>
<quote>"To express to his Majesty our sincere satisfaction in learning that it is his Majesty's determination in maintaining the national faith, by adhering to the engagements into which his Majesty has entered, never to lose sight of the great objects to which all his Majesty's efforts have been directed&#x2014;the termination of the contest between the hostile parties&#x2014;the permanent settlement of their future relations to each other&#x2014;and the maintenance of the repose of Europe upon the basis on which it has rested since the last general Treaty of Peace.</quote>
<quote>"To assure his Majesty that we are highly gratified by learning that the purposes for which his Majesty, upon the requisition of the Court of Lisbon, detached

<quote>"To thank his Majesty for having directed to be laid before us copies of the Treaties of Amity and Commerce which his Majesty has concluded with the emperor of Brazil, and with the United States of Mexico.</quote>
<quote>"To return our acknowledgments to his Majesty, for having ordered the Estimates for the current year to be laid before us, and for the assurance that they have been prepared with every regard to economy consistent with the exigency of the Public Service.</quote>
<quote>"To assure his Majesty, that we will, in pursuance of his Majesty's recommendation, institute an early inquiry into the state of the Revenue and Expenditure of the country.</quote>
<quote>"To express to his Majesty our satisfaction in learning that, notwithstanding the diminution which has taken place in some branches of the Revenue, the total amount of receipt during the last year has not disappointed the expectations which were entertained at the commencement of it, and that a considerable increase has taken place in the export of the principal articles of British manufacture.</quote>
<quote>"To assure his Majesty, that this improvement of our foreign trade is peculiarly gratifying to us, on account of its having led to a more general employment of the population, and because it is a satisfactory indication of the continued abatement of those commercial difficulties which recently affected so severely the national industry.</quote>
<quote>"To return to his Majesty our grateful acknowledgments for the confidence which he has been pleased to express in our continued desire to improve the condition of all classes of his Majesty's subjects, and to recognize the paternal goodness of his Majesty in recommending to our care, as the first object of his Majesty's solicitude, the prosperity and happiness of his people."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00049"><member>Mr. Robert Grant</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;I rise, Sir, for the purpose of seconding the Address. I know not whether I am expected to notice all the topics treated of in the Speech from the Throne, but I certainly do not feel it necessary at this time, point by point, to go over them. There are, indeed, some, to
<col>44</col>
which, as a matter of expediency, it may not be proper, at this moment, to advert. The absence of most of the principal members of his majesty's government, certainly, by no means takes from the House the right, or abridges the right, of free discussion; but, at the same time, it would be inconvenient and unsatisfactory to attempt to enter upon questions intimately connected with disputable measures, in the absence of those whose duty it is to sustain those measures. For this reason, therefore, without imputing the slightest degree of blame to the hon. mover, I shall pass over some of the points to which he has adverted. I am perfectly ready to acquiesce in the doctrine, that no ministry ought to presume on the confidence of the Crown, or on the confidence of parliament and the country, which is not prepared to face all the topics introduced by the hon. gentleman. But the period of the absence of the chief members of that ministry does not seem to me precisely the time for entering upon such a discussion. I do not thus mean at all to question the individual act of the hon. mover. He has a perfect right to state the grounds on which he thinks fit to support this or that government; and, if it were possible for criticism to attack any speech, sure I am that criticism would be disarmed by the diffidence with which that speech was delivered, and the amiable effusions of fraternal love and affection which it displayed.&#x2014;The most gracious Speech of his majesty dwells, at some length, on the pacific state of Europe, and represents it as being, in the main, in a state of perfect and continued tranquillity; at the same time it points out two exceptions to this picture of unrelieved repose. One is a case undoubtedly of the deepest interest; but, from the terms of the Speech, we gather that it has become a source only of joyful recollection. In the other, we are still kept in a state of anxious, but t trust neither painful nor fearful suspense: the one affects the Western, the other the Eastern side of Europe: the one directs our view to Portugal; the other to Greece. About twelve months have now elapsed since our troops disembarked on the shores of the Peninsula, for the defence of a portion of it, and in fulfilment of solemn treaties with Portugal, the ancient and faithful ally of Great Britain. Such were the motives which dictated the expedition. Upon the faith of treaties, Great Britain was called on to preserve the national independence
<image src="S2V0018P0I0030"/>
<col>45</col>
of that kingdom, with which her interests had always been closely connected. Objections to the expedition did, however, exist; not on the score of injustice or impropriety, but that it was calculated to throw additional burthens on the partially exhausted resources of this country. I see one hon. member now in his place who enforced this point with much effect. He urged, that, although the enterprise was indispensable, there was some danger lest it should lead to disagreeable results. It was possible that it might kindle a war of opinion, the consequences of which might be incalculably disastrous. But I find in the king's Speech that which must at once allay all apprehension. We are told that our troops are on the point of returning to our shores: having achieved the object for which they were despatched by the influence of their presence, they are about to revisit their native land, crowned with victory&#x2014;neither the less grateful, nor the less glorious, because it has been bloodless. Whatever might be the difference of opinion at the outset of the expedition &#x2014;some supporting, because it was recommended by justice and policy, and others resisting it, because it might tend to disastrous results&#x2014;assuredly, the conclusion of the enterprise must lead to a united opinion in its favour. Not a syllable was even breathed against its justice; and all classes may now join in one feeling of hearty congratulation. The soil of Portugal has been protected from invasion; the treasury of Great Britain has been, in a great degree, undrained; and the sword of Great Britain has been returned unstained into its scabbard. It was, I think, impossible to touch upon the circumstances connected with the Portuguese expedition without having the mind forcibly recalled to the memory of the distinguished, individual by whom that movement was planned and executed; of whose policy it may be truly said to be the dying effort; and respecting whom, whatever difference may have prevailed upon particular events, there will, I am sure, remain but one feeling of affectionate regret and regard, for the memory of a statesman, who was for so many years; the delight and ornament of this assembly. Providence fortunately preserved him for that last achievement; it had reserved it for one who had the wisdom to project, and the power to execute it: and, though now removed from the control of human events, history will inseparably associate his name with the renown of the
<col>46</col>
measure, and inscribe it upon the column erected to attest national glory. Quitting the topic of Portugal, there are some others to which I must be allowed to refer. In the first place, I must beg leave to remark on that part of his majesty's Speech which refers to the present contest between Greece and the Ottoman Porte. It has, no doubt, been observed by the House, that his majesty's Speech is, on this subject, confined to certain facts which are already before us. In the exposition of the views of government on this question there are certain points on which I entertain little doubt that we shall all be unanimous. There can be no question that the quarrel between the two states has given rise to a most sanguinary contest between the parties interested, and that it has been carried to such an extent, as to involve almost all the shores of the Mediterranean in the consequences, and to disturb the peace of the countries more immediately in the vicinity of the seat of war. I am most willing to believe, that the allied powers, who have interfered hi this question, are impelled by an anxiety to establish a system of affairs on a just and equitable foundation; and, as far as these points go, I think that the House will not hesitate in agreeing with me. But further than this, we can scarcely, with safety, proceed: for, as we have no authentic documents relative to the last proceedings which have taken place before us, I do not see how we can well enter into the question of what has been proper, and of what has been improper, in the course pursued. The House will, no doubt, observe, that the Address which I have the honour to second, follows the same line as that which I have been laying down. It contents itself with thanking his majesty for the communication which he has made us; but it in no way pledges the House to any opinion. There is one point connected with this question, however, on which I wish to add a word; though I am ready to admit that silence, generally speaking, would at present be preferable. The point on which I would speak, certainly presents to me a degree of difficulty which I cannot help feeling&#x2014;little as it appears to affect others. If it be asked, generally, whether, under any circumstances it is either proper or consistent, for foreign nations to interfere&#x2014;and riot merely to interfere, but to interfere coercively&#x2014;between two states at war with each other, I am free to confess that the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0031"/>
<col>47</col>
question is replete with difficulties. I believe it must be admitted, that all writers on the subject have laid down non-interference as the general rule; and, in a question so important as the present, we must look in every direction; not that I mean to say that there are to be no exceptions to this general rule, but they must be confined to cases so special and peculiar, that, on the face of them, the peculiarity must be discernible. If, then, when only one single nation is concerned in the interference, the matter requires such caution, it must be doubly so, when the affair is undertaken by a confederacy; for, however single-hearted any one of the nations may be in its purpose, it cannot answer for the designs of the others; neither can it be sure, that the same wisdom, the same good faith, and the same moderation, are actuating its allies. But though all this makes it unsafe to interfere, there certainly have been and may be cases, where it would be our duty to interfere between two belligerents: for as in England it has never been a question, that a nation, under certain circumstances, has a right to revolt, it would be the grossest of absurdities to suppose, that its allies are to be deprived of the right of aiding' them in their exertions. We ourselves have, in former times, lent armed assistance to Holland, when she was oppressed, and which she still remembers with gratitude; and, at another period, we had received from the same country succour and support. I trust that the House will pardon me for having detained it so long on this subject; but as I could not fail to be sensible to the deep importance attached to it, I was anxious that what I had to say on the matter should not be misunderstood; and if I have declined giving any distant opinion on certain points connected with this topic, I have done so, not because I wished to shrink from it, but from the circumstance of the whole facts of the case not being before the House, and because I did not feel myself at liberty to decide without the fullest information. There is another reason also, why I wish to be very cautious; and that is, because we learn from his majesty's Speech, that there is still a hope that negotiations between the parties will go on, and lead to a compromise without resorting to extreme measures. If this should turn out to be the case, the House will see how necessary it is to be cautious how it comes to any expression
<col>48</col>
of opinion on this point, previous to the question being settled. Certainly any collected expression of opinion, and possibly even an individual opinion, might, at the present epoch, incur the chance of disturbing that tranquillity, the restoration of which every one must be desirous to witness. I do not intend to trouble the House with minute remarks on all the topics which are touched upon in the Speech from the Throne; but there is one to which I must allude for a minute before I sit down&#x2014;I mean that part of the Speech which alludes to the internal situation of this country, and the measures which are contemplated for its amelioration. I do not mean to enter into the consideration of the causes of our commercial depression, nor into the discussion of any measures likely to be proposed for their relief. There is nothing easier than to indulge in florid descriptions of pleasing anticipations and sanguine hopes; but the royal Speech wisely abstains from any extravagance of that nature: it fairly and plainly says, that some improvement has taken place, but that much yet remains to be done; and it calls upon parliament to take the matter into its fullest consideration, and thereby to discharge a necessary, though a most laborious, duty. There are certain evils, however, under which the country is suffering, to which I doubt whether it is in the power of the legislature to apply a direct remedy, I mean the evils of depression, which are still affecting the productive classes. This is the subject that is pressed upon our attention; and we can have no objection to pledge ourselves to the prosecution of the inquiry how far the public expenditure may be reduced, consistently with the necessary demands of the country, and in what degree we may be able to improve the internal condition of the people. With respect to the manufacturing classes, to which the Speech has alluded, I believe that one of the chief causes of the depression under which they are suffering, is far removed beyond the control of the House. I am afraid we must not be sanguine enough to hope that the improvement of their condition will be rapid; and I cannot help feeling a great doubt, whether parliament, with all its boasted omnipotence, will be able to accelerate so desirable an event. This, however, so far from furnishing any excuse for remissness on our parts, should, on the contrary, furnish the strongest mo-

tives for activity. Whatever our success may be likely to be, let us at all events do our best; so that at least the country may see, and we ourselves feel, that every thing has been done by us that could be done, in the honest and faithful discharge of our duty; and though, on some occasions, the disposition of the people of England may be wayward, yet I have sufficient faith in their good sense and candour, to believe, that when they see parliament exerting itself for their benefit, they will afford it a firm co-operation and assistance. By pursuing, therefore, the course, pointed out to us by the Crown, we shall be discharging our duty to them and to ourselves; and assuredly, if we may judge from the tenor of the Speech which we have heard this night, we may conclude, that in promoting the happiness of the people, we shall effectually be promoting one of the most earnest objects of his majesty's solicitude.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00050"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, he agreed most entirely in one of the observations of his hon. and learned friend who had just seconded the Address, and the propriety of which must indeed receive a general and unqualified assent; namely, that circumstances rendered the present time most inconvenient for the discussion of the several important matters referred to in the Speech from the Throne. At the same time, he must, on his own part, as well as on that of the constitutional authority of the House, assert the unquestionable right of every member to discuss, if it so pleased him, every part of the Speech which had been read from the chair, just as if the whole of his majesty's ministers were at that moment in their seats in parliament. But, while he asserted such a right he assented to the manifest inexpediency of the present time for entertaining that discussion, because it would not be quite consistent with perfect fairness and candour, to enter at once upon the consideration of so great a variety of topics, in the absence of those who were bound to explain and defend them. He owned, however, at the same time, his wish, that his hon. and learned friend, the seconder, as well as the hon. mover of the Address, had suggested to their own minds the propriety of following themselves the advice which they had recommended to others. It was a little inconsistent that their own conduct should be an exception to their own admonition;
<col>50</col>
and rather singular that they should unhesitatingly depart from that advice, which with so much propriety as well as justice they had been pleased to impart to others. It was one thing to say that the means of discussion were not at present within the reach of the House, nor the men present whose measures and conduct were to be discussed, therefore candour suggested that the attack (if attack there was to be) ought not to be made until the defence could fairly be produced; and it was quite another thing at the same moment to discuss these very topics on one side, and forbid all allusion to them on the other. An abstinence on both sides would have been fair and proper; but to give this advice in one breath, and to depart from it widely in the next, by entering elaborately into all the topics upon which difference of opinion might be reasonably presumed, and only preserving silence upon those points on which all were agreed, was, to say the least of it, remarkably inconsistent. See the pain which must be imposed by such a course. You profess a desire to prevent discussion in the absence of the ministers, but you place your opponents in the unpleasant situation of hearing that discussion, <i>ex parte,</i> and being, for urgent reasons, interdicted from all reply. Yet, such was the position in which they were placed by the course that had been so singularly pursued on the present occasion. The hon. mover had come forward with his, as it were, plenary approbation of the Speech from the Throne. He was, no doubt, perfectly right in giving his approval, and no blame attached to him for accompanying the declaration with his reasons; but, it was rather hard, while this was done on one side, that members should be called upon to hold their peace on the other [hear&#x0021;]. There was no excuse for this inconsistency, of giving a plenary approbation of the breaking up of the old Administration, even coupled as it was with the lesson which the hon. mover had brought down to them from his noble relative, the earl of Liverpool, who wished to have it notified to the House that he approved of the construction of the new Administration. Glad, indeed, he was, to hear of the noble earl's convalescence; for he, as well as the public, had thought that the noble lord was neither in a condition to take advice, nor to understand the important topics upon which he was said to have
<image src="S2V0018P0I0033"/>
<col>51</col>
given any: but he must beg at the same time, with every proper feeling of delicacy, to object to the delivery of this kind of message from the noble earl, respectable as he was in private life, and in all his domestic relations, because he had been uniformly a minister, indeed possessing office hereditarily, and a member of all the governments throughout his time &#x2014;save only the last. The House needed hot advice from such a quarter; even though so respectable and so irreproachable. That noble earl had always demeaned himself inoffensively to those who were in public life his antagonists. He had always found the' noble lord the fairest and most candid of adversaries; but in at was no reason for presenting to the House the noble lord's uncalled for advice, and his assurance that the present administration, founded upon the ruins of the old, was the best of all possible governments. Doubtless the noble' earl meant to approve of all the members of that hew administration, though with sortie of them he had essentially differed on many occasions. Doubtless he meant equally to approve of all the Omissions in its construction, which had so astounded, the public; highly approving he doubt, of the absence from office of his old and learned friend and colleague, the earl of Eldon, whose name had accompanied his own through life, with an attachment so inviolable, that it resembled the connexion between Castor and Pollux. So much, indeed, had they been twin stars in the horizon of this nether political world, that one could hardly be named except in conjunction with the other. There never had, he believed, been a political measure in which they were disjoined, or a movement, in which they did not conjointly participate. Most remarkable was it, therefore, that the noble earl could have recorded his unqualified approval of the omission of the name of his ancient colleague in the roll of the new government. Most surprising it was, that such an opinion could be communicated from the noble earl, respecting those with whom he had so long happily acted, and who were not, happily a part of the present administration [a laugh]. In making these observations, he should hot suffer himself to be drawn into unnecessary discussion, notwithstanding the example which had been improvidently set; for he entirely concurred in the propriety of abstaining from debating measures in the
<col>52</col>
absence of the information which was to throw a light upon them, and of the persons who were bound to vindicate them. While, however, he was ready to abstain from premature discussion, he must protect himself against being concluded from protesting, when the proper season arrived, against many of the doctrines, and many of the arguments, of the hon. mover and seconder of the Address. He must not be considered as agreeing in any one of those questionable propositions, or in the equally questionable arguments, with which they had been supported; and still more against being considered as adopting the terms used in the Address from the Throne. He wished for the presence of those by whom the king's Speech had been penned, before he impugned it as one which, more than any other he had ever heard, tended to commit the country in a position of peculiar embarrassment. Against one paragraph of that Address, he was most anxious to record at once his unqualified dissent; having at the same time the fullest and firmest conviction, that that dissent would be re-echoed from one end of the kingdom to the other. He meant to allude to the manner in which the late glorious, brilliant, decisive, and immortal, achievement at Navarino was described, as being a matter to be lamented. This was the first time he had ever seen men anxious to come forward and refuse credit where it had been called for, and set at nought the most splendid atchievement of their arms. It had been reserved for some of the men of these times, to triumph and to be afraid&#x2014;to conquer and to repine&#x2014;to fight as heroes did, the contest of freedom, and still to tremble like slaves&#x2014;to act gloriously, and repine bitterly&#x2014;to win by brave men the battle of liberty in the east, and in the west to pluck from the valiant brow the laurels which it had so nobly earned, and plant the cypress in their stead, because the conqueror had fought for religion and liberty. He hailed as a bad omen the designation of a great naval achievement as an "untoward event." He complained of this passage, on the part of certain honourable gentlemen, who formed a portion of the late, as they did of the present administration, but who were not present to state their sentiments with reference to this point. The government came down and said, "O&#x0021; you must not discuss such and such subjects, because Mr. Grant and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0034"/>
<col>53</col>
Mr. Huskisson are absent." On that account they were called on not to discuss certain measures. He certainly did not wish to discuss them in their absence; but, was it right for those who drew up the Speech to put into the mouth of their sovereign an attack on Mr. Grant and Mr. Huskisson, which they could not answer at the present moment? Perhaps it would be said, that no attack on them was intended. If not, against whom was the attack&#x2014;for such it appeared to him to be&#x2014;intended? Was it meant for that intrepid officer who led the British fleet to victory? Was it meant for those gallant men who had fought and bled in the cause of liberty and humanity? The censure was directed either against Mr. Grant and Mr. Huskisson, or against the gallant officer who was employed on this important occasion. "In this dilemma, my lord field marshal duke of Wellington and prime minister, you are placed. From this dilemma it is impossible you can extricate yourself. Out of this dilemma, not your finest man&#x0153;uvres, not your most accomplished movements, be they ever so bold, ever so nimble, ever so well-constructed, will be sufficient to extricate you. Either you blame Mr. Huskisson and Mr. Grant&#x2014;not only blame them, but get the brother of Mr. Grant to stand up in this house to censure them, on account of this measure&#x2014;or there is no blame whatever imputed by you. In that case, the blame is all meant on the other side: it is directed against those who fought this glorious battle&#x2014;against those who led our gallant seamen to victory. They must be the objects of blame, if Mr. Huskisson and Mr. Grant are not." He, however, could not conceive, how censure could be cast upon the chief in that engagement, after he had been thanked by his sovereign&#x2014;after he had been distinguished by the praises of his superior in the navy&#x2014;after he had been covered with honours, which were only less estimable than the fame and glory which he had achieved in the service of his country. Wholly concurring in the sentiment, that it would be greatly for the benefit of Greece if peace were restored, and believing that this victory would mainly contribute to the attainment of that object, he greatly rejoiced in the event. Deploring, as he should do, the commencement of war; particularly deploring such a circumstance in the present state of the finances of this country, still he could not find fault with
<col>54</col>
the step which had been taken. He concurred entirely in his hon. and learned friend's view of the question, when he deprecated war: but he could not, while touching on this point, avoid stating, that he observed with regret, an approximation to a military system in this country; the government being represented, in the other house, by field-marshal the duke of Wellington, and in that house by the noble Secretary at War. He really thought, that too much had been said about their ancient and faithful, religious ally, the religious and liberal emperor of the Turks; especially as the head of the Protestant interest&#x2014;one, he was going to say, almost on the throne of this country&#x2014;had expressed himself perfectly satisfied with what had been done. He trusted that a system of perverted feeling with respect to political measures would not recur. The brilliant success which had attended the introduction of a liberal system into our foreign policy, under the administration of a right hon. gentleman of transcendent merit, would, he hoped, sufficiently show the necessity of proceeding in the same course. He trusted that the talents and the exertions of that eminent man&#x2014;who had fallen a sacrifice to the vile abuse which had been heaped upon him&#x2014;would not be lost to the country. The success which had attended the right hon. gentleman's efforts, induced him to hope, that the liberal system which the right hon. gentleman had introduced would be for ever pursued by this country. He trusted that they should no longer have to dread, as they had formerly dreaded, lest their names should be coupled with liberal principles. He trusted that they should not, in future, be ashamed of all that was best in their own institutions, while they supported all that was worst, most approved, and most legitimate, in other monarchies. He trusted that England would long continue to be, what she had for the last three or four years been, since Mr. Canning came into office, the refuge and solace of persecuted freemen, and not the refuge and solace of the tyrants by whom they were persecuted. He hoped that, wherever any tyranny was exercised&#x2014;wherever any system of misgovernment was apparent&#x2014;wherever any plan of cruelty or of fraud was contemplated and enforced against the liberties of the people&#x2014;those who suffered by such iniquitous proceedings would never cease to look to England for succour and support.

<col>55</col>
The manner in which our "ancient ally" was spoken of, while in the same passage the splendid victory of Navarino was described as an "untoward event," led him to entertain some fears as to the policy which would hereafter be pursued; but he sincerely hoped that those fears would prove groundless.&#x2014;He had carefully abstained from making any remark on the government generally, or on any of its individual members; but he would, for himself, declare, that let the government be composed of whom it might&#x2014;let the causes (which he pretended not to know) of the changes that had recently taken place be what they might still, so long as he found certain men forming part and parcel of the administration&#x2014;so long as he thought he could rely on their determination to pursue a wise, salutary, and liberal line of foreign and domestic policy (which the Speech from the Throne gave him, for the first time, reason to doubt), so long should they have his support. He looked not to the members of the administration, but to their measures; and if those measures were good, the administration should have&#x2014;not a reluctant or tardy&#x2014;but as hearty, as sincere, and as active, a support, as if he were sitting on the other side of the House. He was intimately connected with those from whom those liberal measures, so beneficial to the country, had flowed; and he believed that they felt, on this point, exactly as he did.&#x2014;He could not sit down without saying a few words on a particular circumstance, connected with the present administration, to which, he confessed, he felt a very great degree of objection. He alluded to the commander-in-chief of the army having been placed, by his sovereign, at the head of the government. No man valued more highly than he did the illustrious services of the noble duke, as a soldier. No man gloried more in the numerous victories which the noble duke had achieved than he did. Indeed, when many persons were undervaluing those victories, and describing them as "untoward events," he raised his voice in that House, and endeavoured to show their importance. He was one of the first to endeavour, by all the means in his power, to promote the successful career of the noble duke, by placing greater and more extensive resources at his disposal. But, though he entertained the highest opinion of the noble duke's military genius, still he did not like to see him at the head
<col>56</col>
of the finance of the country, enjoying all the patronage of the Crown,&#x2014;enjoying, as he did enjoy, the full and perfect confidence of his sovereign,&#x2014;enjoying the patronage of the army,&#x2014;enjoying the patronage of the church,&#x2014;and, in fact, enjoying almost all the patronage of the state. To the noble duke also was intrusted the delicate function of conveying constant and confidential advice to the ear of his royal master. As a constitutional man, this state of things struck him as being most unconstitutional. He was, indeed, told, that the noble duke was a person of very great vigour in council, and that his talents were not confined to the art of war. It might be so; but that did not remove his objections against the noble duke's being placed in possession of such an immense mass of civil and military influence. It was said, that the noble duke was incapable of speaking, in public, as a first minister of the Crown ought to do. Now, he conceived that there was no validity in that objection. He happened to be present when the noble duke, last year, had the modesty and candour to declare, in another place, that he was unfit for the situation of first minister, and he really thought he had never heard a better speech in the whole course of his life [a laugh]. Nothing could be more suited to the occasion. He never saw less want of capacity in an individual who might be called on to take an active part in debate. This, therefore, was not his reason for objecting to the appointment. That objection rested on the constitutional grounds which he had already stated, and, moreover, because the noble duke's experience had been purely military, not civil. It was scarcely necessary to remind the House of the noble duke's near connexion with the very worst, the most despotic, and the most purely military system, into which this country had ever been seduced. That, however, formed in his mind, another, and a very strong objection to the noble duke's being placed at the head of the administration. It was not any compensation to him, or to the country, to hear (what he had heard, not in that place, but out of doors), "Oh&#x0021; the duke of Wellington is a person who will take care to have his own way; patronage will now go in its right channel; influence will no longer have any effect in the distribution of patronage, as many persons will find." This was no compensation to him for so
<image src="S2V0018P0I0036"/>
<col>57</col>
objectionable an appointment. What was rumoured out of doors, as to the future disposal of patronage, might be true&#x2014;perhaps it was true; but the House would not consider that to be a compensation, the country would not consider it to be a compensation, for this appointment. He could not see why individuals of rank should not recommend persons to high offices in the army, the navy, or the church. It was the duty of the minister to judge of their fitness, and on him lay the responsibility of the appointment; but, that any one individual, of exalted rank, of great connexions, of extensive and commanding influence, should alone have the power of nominating to situations in the army, the navy, and the church, was what he did not understand. Why the court, as it was called&#x2014;the nobility and gentry&#x2014;should be excluded from recommending to situations, he could not conceive. Why the nobility in general, or why wealthy commoners, possessing perhaps two or three boroughs, should be bound hand and foot, and prevented from recommending to situations, he could not discover. This was not his reading of the constitution. He was not aware, on constitutional grounds, why their recommendations should not be received. The patronage was in the minister, and he was responsible for the manner in which he disposed of it; and, be the person who came forward with a recommendation a peer or a boroughholder, he cared not: if an improper nomination was made, he had a responsible minister to answer for it. There was, therefore, in this new arrangement, no security or compensation to the House or to the country for this union of power; and, therefore, in his view of the matter, it was utterly unconstitutional.&#x2014;Let it not be supposed, however, that he was inclined to exaggerate. He had no fear of slavery being introduced into this country, by the power of the sword. It would take a stronger, it would demand a more powerful, man, even than the duke of Wellington, to effect such an object. The noble duke might take the army, he might take the navy, he might take the mitre, he might take the great seal&#x2014;he would make the noble duke a present of them all. Let him come on with his whole force, sword in hand, against the constitution, and the energies of the people of this country would not only beat him, but laugh at his efforts. Therefore he was perfectly satis-
<col>58</col>
fied, that there would be no unconstitutional attack on the liberties of the people. These were not the times for such an attempt. There had been periods when the country heard with dismay that "the soldier was abroad." That was not the case now. Let the soldier be ever so much abroad, in the present age he could do nothing. There was another person abroad,&#x2014;a less important person,&#x2014;in the eyes of some an insignificant person,&#x2014;whose labours had tended to produce this state of things. The schoolmaster was abroad [cheers]&#x0021; and he trusted more to the schoolmaster, armed with his primer, than he did to the soldier in full military array, for upholding and extending the liberties of his country. He thought the appointment of the duke of Wellington was bad, in a constitutional point of view; but as to any violence being, in consequence, directed against the liberties of the country, the fear of such an event he looked upon as futile and groundless.&#x2014;He felt it incumbent upon him to say, that in giving his consent to the Address, he did so with a reservation as to the manner in which the battle of Navarino was spoken of. He protested against that portion of it on the part of the late government; he protested against it on the part of Mr. Huskisson and Mr. Grant, who were not now present; and he protested against it on the part of the country, by whom he thought the terms in which that great victory were noticed would be received with astonishment and disgust [hear].</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00051"><member>Sir Joseph Yorke</member><membercontribution> said, he hoped that the noble Secretary at War would not suffer the House to separate without giving the House some explanation with respect to the change of ministry, and the course which the new administration meant to pursue. He had hoped that the principles advocated by the great man now no more would have continued to be the principles of the government. He should like to know how these changes had been brought about, how the union of Whig and Tory had been put an end to by the appointment of the duke of Wellington, which had filled the country with astonishment. Was it in Great Britain that such difficulty could be found in forming a ministry? Could not individuals be found of sufficient talents and integrity to govern the country? Could not individuals be discovered who would agree with each other in carrying on the business of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0037"/>
<col>59</col>
country with a sole view only to its welfare? Were they become so degenerate, that ministers could not be found to conduct the public affairs, unless it was stipulated that they should be placed in a situation to command one job or another? He could not agree with the hon. seconder in what he had said relative to the dispute Navarino. The Greeks were by no means exempt from faults. For his part, he was inclined to consider the Turks as very honest fellows; although they had a way of governing people by taking off their heads. He thanked the learned gentleman opposite for his able speech. He had opened the thunder of his artillery with great effect, upon the Treasury-bench. Indeed, he had almost trade him tremble on his seat. In his opinion, the noble Secretary at War could not get out of the business any more than the duke of Wellington, unless he stated what had given rise to the extraordinary change that had been effected in the government of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00052"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, he felt it impossible not to, notice some of the topics that were mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. It appeared to him that there was an almost unqualified regret, throughout the country, at the disastrous affair of Navarino&#x2014;an affair which had created dismay and astonishment. Those who had agreed to the treaty were placed in a dilemma from which they could not extricate themselves; seeing that the necessary consequence of that treaty, which he considered to be impolitic and unjust, was the deplorable event to which he had alluded. There would, he knew, arrive other opportunities for arguing this point; but as it farmed so prominent a part of his majesty's Speech, and as that Speech seemed, in some manner, to countenance that transaction, he could not suffer the topic to be passed by in silence. The hon. and learned gentleman had spoken of the foreign policy which this government ought to adopt. Was it, then, British policy to interfere in the internal affairs of other states. Was it not contrary to the law of nations to do so? And had they not, by the treaty into which they had entered, violated that law? The hon. and learned gentleman maintained that this was a contest for religion and liberty. It was no such thing. The treaty was founded on a false pretence; and they were next told that the intention was to put down piracy. But, was it ne-
<col>60</col>
cessary for England, the greatest naval country under the sun, to call to her assistance two other powers, to check and put down a system of piracy? Was it necessary that a fleet of sixteen sail of the line should be employed in such a business? It was ridiculous to make such an assertion. Could any one imagine it necessary to equip such a force for the purpose of putting down the piratical attempts of either or both of the hostile powers? No such thing. It was apparent, on the face of the matter, that the force was entirely directed against the power which was in amity with this country, and that, too, without any sufficing cause. In his view of the case, the entire subject, the treaty and every thing connected with it, should be referred to a secret committee: for it would not, perhaps, be proper that such an inquiry should be public. He should be glad to know in what situation this country stood at present; and whether we were at war or peace with Turkey. As to the gallant officer who had behaved so honourably at Navarino, he had nothing to say against him. He had only to lament, that that meritorious individual had been engaged in an attack on an ancient ally. It would, however, be right that the House should know, hereafter, what instructions were given to him on that disastrous occasion. As there must be various discussions on this business, he should not detain the House longer; but he deemed it necessary, thus early, to throw out these hints, because he thought that there ought to be an expression of the opinion of the House on this part of the Speech. As to Portugal, he was glad to learn that the troops sent there were on the eve of returning. That measure, also, was not in the spirit of British policy, inasmuch as it interfered with the government of foreign nations, an interference not justified by circumstances, nor demanded by our own interest or safety. He deprecated, in the strongest terms, every thing connected with the treaty. If it should he attended with a happy result, he should ascribe it to good fortune rather than to wise counsels.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00053"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> said, he agreed with his hon. and learned friend, as far as he was informed of the circumstances, that the battle of Navarino was a necessary consequence of the treaty of London. He agreed, also, most fully, in the protest of his hon. and learned friend against those
<image src="S2V0018P0I0038"/>
<col>61</col>
expressions in the Speech from the Throne, which seemed to cast a censure upon the gallant admiral who commanded at Navarino. It would be hard, indeed, upon naval officers, if they were to be employed in highly delicate and important duties, and were liable afterwards to have blame insinuated against them, without the clearest proof that cause for such blame existed. With respect to the treaty of London, undoubtedly he felt considerable doubts both as to its policy and justice. But, nevertheless, he could not bring himself to give so decided an opinion as his hon. friend who spoke last had done. He would hear the explanations of those who were responsible for the treaty, and not, in their absence, prejudge the question; and therefore he wished that the subject, for the present, had been avoided. As to the affairs of Portugal, he felt the same satisfaction which the hon. member expressed; but his satisfaction arose from a very different cause. He was glad to hear that the British troops were about to leave that country; but he was so, because they had been entirely successful in the object for which they were sent out. England was bound by treaty to prevent the interference of foreign powers with Portugal. A demonstration of interference on the part of Spain induced Portugal to ask for our assistance; and it was as impossible in faith and honour, as it was in sound policy, to refuse it. In giving that assistance, we had given it without any desire to support one party in the country more than another. Portugal no longer required it; and the troops were, therefore, withdrawn; the object of their occupation being accomplished. He abstained, for the present, from entering into the question of the composition of the present administration. In that administration lie had no confidence; but he felt bound not to state the reasons for that want of confidence until those members of the government to whose conduct he objected were present in that House, and had an opportunity of explaining the course they had pursued. He concluded, therefore, by renewing, in conjunction with his hon. and learned friend, his protest against that part of the Speech which alluded to the battle of Navarino.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00054"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> agreed, that it would be inexpedient to enter at present into many subjects which had been referred to in the course of the evening; but there
<col>62</col>
were one or two points which had fallen from hon. gentlemen on the other side, which his sense of duty to the House would not allow him to pass unnoticed. Therefore he would not accept the invitation of the gallant member, to go at once into a relation of the circumstances which, had led to the recent change in his majesty's councils. Because, even if he were to succeed in satisfying the gallant member upon the subject, he should incur, and deservedly incur, the censure of the House. But, postponing that question as the noble lord opposite was disposed to do, until the parties concerned were present, he would merely call the attention of the House to a few accusations, proceeding from other quarters, which he considered to be groundless and unfounded. The hon. and learned member, seemed to think the Address objectionable, because it contained certain expressions, amounting to disapprobation, of a late important occurrence. Now, he could not but think that it would have been a great fault on the part of administration, if they had omitted to touch, in the royal Speech, upon a topic of so much public interest: and he was ready to admit, that it would have been improper in the mover or seconder, to have called upon the House to sanction any address, which would have committed the House upon a question of great national importance. But surely a very little of that critical examination which no man was more capable than the hon. and learned gentleman of employing, would convince him, that there was nothing in the present address which committed the House to any particular line of policy. The address only thanked his majesty for the communication he had been pleased to make, and did not commit the parties who supported it upon any point whatever. The hon. and learned gentleman had a peculiar pleasantry and humour in his attacks, which made them amusing, even to those at whom they were most especially pointed; but he certainly had not displayed good taste in the manner in which he had been pleased to advert to the military character of the duke of Wellington. The claims which that noble and gallant duke had established to the gratitude of this country, stood upon a basis too firm to be shaken by any taunts or sneers that might be thrown out against them. He was persuaded that the noble duke felt perfectly indifferent to the remarks of the hon. and learned gentleman, and that he might
<image src="S2V0018P0I0039"/>
<col>63</col>
safely leave their answer to the good taste and intelligence of the House. There was one topic however upon which he was glad to be able to relieve the alarms of the hon. and learned gentleman. The military office formerly held by the noble duke would not be united to the political. The noble duke had tendered to the king his resignation of the office of commander-in-chief, on the same day that he had accepted that of first lord of the treasury; and although no successor to the post had as yet been appointed, the House might consider the resignation as virtually made: from the present time, the duke of Wellington would cease to be commander-in-chief. Therefore it was to be hoped that the fears of the hon. and learned gentleman, and his apprehensions of the dangerous consequences of the military, civil, and church patronage, being united in one individual, would cease also. Whatever danger there might be in such an event, the House, might be assured it was not about to occur.&#x2014;Another objection taken by the hon. and learned gentleman to the present prime minister was, that the noble duke's habits and experience had been military, and not civil. But the hon. and learned gentleman himself had admitted, that, in the speech in which the noble duke, with an honourable modesty, had disclaimed the possession of talents which qualified him for the first situation in the country&#x2014;the very terms and manner in which that disclaimer was made, showed that the modesty of the speaker far underrated his own capacities. And surely the personal knowledge of the hon. and learned gentleman must sufficiently instruct him, that the whole of the duke of Wellington's experience had not been confined to the army. The House at least would know, that there had been scarcely an important transaction in Europe for the last thirteen years in which the noble duke, at home or abroad, had not directly borne a part. The hon. and learned member could not surely recollect what had actually been the case, when he spoke of the experience of the duke of Wellington as having been entirely military. The hon. and learned gentleman, had been pleased to state, that he, for once, should prove a better tactician than the noble duke; and that he had got him into a dilemma, out of which it would not be easy for him to escape. Now, he denied the existence of any dilemma; there was no dilemma at all.
<col>64</col>
The hon. and learned member said, that the Speech pronounced a condemnation upon the battle of Navarino. He asserted that it did not do so; that it censured, or condemned nothing. It contained no censure upon the treaty which had produced the battle, nor any blame of the gallant admiral who had commanded in it. The Speech said, that the conflict was unexpected; and, certainly, there could be no doubt that it had been so. Because, although some collision might have been expected, yet the affair of Navarino took place in a way which could not be expected. It had arisen out of a combination of circumstances which could not be foreseen; and therefore it must have been a collision entirely unexpected by the government. He thought it impossible that his majesty could be advised to allude to a battle taking place under such circumstances, without an expression of regret,&#x2014;a battle, speaking without the smallest condemnation of it, which had taken place between his fleets, and the fleets of a country with which we were not only not at war, but with which we were absolutely on terms of alliance. The expressions used, did not mean any reflection upon the conduct of the gallant admiral commanding, and could not fairly be so construed. The honours sent out to the gallant admiral were a sufficient proof of this. Those testimonies proved that his skill and gallantry were duly appreciated. The gallant officer still continued in his situation of high and important trust. Would this be the case, if the government considered that any censure ought to be passed upon him? No censure was meant, nor was any expressed; and therefore the dilemma in which the hon. and learned member proposed to involve the government, was without existence. But the hon. and learned member's apprehensions were not confined to the treatment of the victors in the late engagement, or to the combination of power in the person of the duke of Wellington. He was alarmed for the general welfare of the state, and trusted that the new ministry were not returning to that system of foreign and domestic policy, which had proved so adverse to the best interests of the country. Nothing would be more improper than to declare beforehand what were the intentions of any administration; but when the House found the noble earl at the head of Foreign Affairs who had held, that situation in the ministry of Mr.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0040"/>
<col>65</col>
Canning, the right hon. member for Liverpool continuing to be minister for the colonial department, and the same President of the Board of Trade charged with the direction of our commercial system, surely there was no reason to anticipate that those persons would depart from the principles upon which they had hitherto acted, and which had met, almost universally, with approbation and support. All he would say was &#x2014;judge of the new government by its measures, not by the notions that any individuals may form of what those measures were to be. The hon. member for Corfe Castle had asked, whether we were at war or at peace with Turkey? Certainly, not at war. Our ambassador had quitted Constantinople; but no change had taken place in our policy. Therefore, we were still at peace. With respect to Greece, he would merely say, that the treaty and protocol would be laid before the House, but it was not intended at present to found any motion upon them. The negotiations connected with the treaty were not yet ended. There was no reason to believe that they would be ended, otherwise than to the advantage of the country; but it was possible that present discussion might operate prejudicially. If, under these circumstances, it should be thought advisable to bring forward any motion, ministers would be prepared to meet it; though they would not, at present, originate any themselves. The hon. member for Corfe Castle, had formerly stated, and now repeated, that the expedition to Portugal had been sent out in order to interfere with the internal arrangements of that country. He denied this. The expedition had been sent out to fulfil the treaty we had entered into to defend Portugal from external attack. He did not mean to say that he was not gratified by the course which affairs had taken in Portugal. It was satisfactory to see that country with something like a liberal form of government,&#x2014;satisfactory, because he believed that our relations with every state were made more firm and safe by the admission of the people generally to some share in the government, or at least by giving the public voice the power of expression.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00055"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, in explanation, that the noble lord had endeavoured to make it appear that he had spoken lightly of the military reputation of the duke of Wellington. Now, he asked every member, whether the words which he had used, did
<col>66</col>
not bear an entirely opposite construction? He entirely agreed with the noble lord, that what he said could not matter to the duke of Wellington. All Europe was aware of the noble duke's talents and deserts; but it would matter considerably to him, if he should be supposed so foolish as to have uttered any sentiments but those of respect and gratitude to the duke for his military services. He had himself in that House, over and over again, when those with whom he was connected by party had been disposed to hang back, absolutely urged the government to place larger means at the disposal of the noble duke. What he had said on the present evening was in order to draw the line between the position of a finance minister and a commander-in-chief. If saying that the duke was not the best qualified to be a finance minister was attacking his military reputation, those who took it to be so gave a meaning to words which, in the ordinary usage of society, they did not bear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00056"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> said, he would take that opportunity of entering his protest against the kind of declamation in which the noble Secretary at War had indulged when speaking of the duke of Wellington. He remembered very well when that noble duke last year proposed a clause in the Corn-bill, which was considered highly injurious to the commercial interests of the country, it was said, "how can gentlemen possibly make an objection to this clause, when they consider that this very day is the 18th of June, the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo?" Now, he felt great thanks were due to the duke for having gained that battle, but, nevertheless, the clause in the Corn-bill was a very injurious one to the country; and he protested against the practice hereafter, that, whenever the duke should propose any very objectionable measure, or make any financial blunder, as a prime minister, that the House should be met with a reference to his military services. The duke of Wellington having placed himself in a civil capacity, must submit to be judged of in that capacity. It was hardly necessary for him to say, that in all that the duke of Wellington might hereafter do, his past services, if not openly referred to, would not be the less remembered. But he could not help thinking, that those very habits of command which had been most befitting the noble duke in his military station, and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0041"/>
<col>67</col>
to which much of his success probably had been owing, were likely to prove most; objectionable and dangerous in the situation of first minister of a free country. Neither was he entirely satisfied by the statement which the noble lord opposite had made on the subject of the command of the army. He must know how that situation was intended to be filled, before he should be convinced, that some part of the patronage of it would not still remain at the disposal of the duke of Wellington in his new capacity. He admitted that it was but fair to wait for the measures of the new ministry before the House decided upon its character. He certainly saw symptoms of danger in the formation of the government; but he would not make up his mind definitively until he saw it act. There was one point which he would just mention, not less on account of its vital importance, than because it had not been noticed in the Speech from the Throne. He meant the condition of Ireland. No government should have his support, which did not adopt measures to improve the situation of that country. With regard to the affair of Navarino, he regretted the phrase made use of in the Speech. He was bound to take the meaning of the words from the noble lord opposite; but certainly, if they were not intended to intimate, that the gallant admiral who fought that battle had fought it without instructions and unadvisedly, they were the most unlucky words, for their real purpose, that could possibly have been chosen. For himself, he believed the battle to have been a glorious victory, and a necessary consequence of the treaty of London; and moreover, as honest a victory as had ever been gained since the beginning of the world. With respect to the affairs of Portugal, he congratulated the House upon the termination of that affair, and of the probable restoration to peace and security of our ancient ally. This last expression put him in mind of a rather ludicrous mistake which was commonly made, in discussing the affairs of Turkey. Turkey was constantly spoken of as our "ancient ally." Now, the fact was, that there had never been any alliance between Turkey and this country prior to the year 1799; and it was not twenty years since Air. Arbuthnot had been compelled to fly privately from Constantinople, from the fear that his safety would be endangered, by a violation of the rights of ambassadors.</membercontribution></p>
<col>68</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00057"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> said, that he also was desirous, like his noble friend, of seeing, what measures the administration intended to propose before he venture4 to pronounce condemnation. He would go, further, and say, that from the introduction into it of many of his friends, whom he supported in the late administration, he had a favourable impression of the course which they intended to pursue; and he trusted he should be able to give them his support. He concurred in what had fallen from the noble lord who preceded him, in what he had said respecting the gallant admiral who had fought the battle of Navarin. But, the object of the treaty was the maintenance of peace, and a good understanding with Turkey; this action, therefore, must certainly be acknowledged to be an untoward circumstance in that point of view, and he confessed he thought it was very natural and proper that it should be spoken of in the speech from the throne, as it had been. With regard to the office of commander-in-chief, he was happy to hear that it had been resigned by the noble duke who now occupied the first office in the state. With respect to Portugal, he perfectly agreed in what had fallen from the noble lord who spoke last. Our troops were returning home, after having performed the service which they were sent on, to the advantage of Portugal and the honour of England. This country had no other course to take than that she had taken: the alternative of honour or disgrace was open to her; she had taken the path of honour, and every one must rejoice at the result.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00058"><member>Lord Normanby</member><membercontribution> said, he had entered the House without the slightest intention of saying a word on the present occasion, and would certainly have adhered to his resolution but for what had fallen from the hon. gentleman who had just sat down. For his part, he could only say, that he had no confidence in the present government: he had no confidence in the composition of the ministry, and could not give them his support. He could not address the House, for the first time since the death of the late lamented premier, without expressing his deep regret at the loss which the country had experienced. A remnant of that right hon. gentleman's friends were left, and he should have expected much from them, were it not for the connections which they had lately formed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ADDRESS OF THE KING'S SPEECH.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00063"><member>Mr. Jenkinson</member><membercontribution> brought up the report of the Address on the King's Speech.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00064"><member>Mr. Brownlow</member><membercontribution> said, that, previous to the report being read, he wished to express the feelings which influenced his conduct on the present occasion. Fie should support the Address, subject to the explanation which had been offered by the noble Secretary at War, regarding the objectionable portion of the King's Speech &#x2014;an explanation, without which he would not consent to the Address, and unaccompanied by which the Speech from the throne would be received, throughout the
<col>70</col>
country, with sentiments of sorrow and regret. He did think that some explanation was due to the House on the matter. One had certainly been given, which, though it prevented him from opposing the Address, was scarcely adequate to the occasion. Even after the explanation of the noble lord, he was still of opinion&#x2014;and he was confident that the House and the country united with him in the sentiment &#x2014;that, the expression, "untoward event," was, to say the least of it, an ungracious one, when applied to so glorious an achievement as the victory of Navarino. He was willing to fall in with the general disposition of the House to preserve that unanimity which was so desirable, when voting an answer to his majesty's Speech; but he at the same time wished it to be distinctly understood, that if that Speech could be interpreted as conveying a particle of censure upon the conduct of sir Edward Codrington, it was his decided opinion, that a very different Address ought to be voted. That gallant officer had acted, under circumstances of great difficulty and delicacy, with the plain, straight-forward, unsophisticated understanding, of an English sailor, and had displayed equal wisdom and firmness in the management of the early part of the task committed to his hands, as he had displayed irresistible valour in the celebrated battle which afterwards occurred. He would assert, that a more glorious achievement never adorned the naval annals of this country; that there was no deed of arms related in our history which could exceed the gallant affair of Navarino &#x2014;a victory than which, of all naval victories, none could redound more to the credit of the brave officers and seamen by whom it had been won.&#x2014;He wished it to be clearly understood, that he was as hostile as any member to an undue and uncalled for interference with other countries. He was as ready as any member of the administration which had existed a year ago, or of the present administration, which was a remnant of it, to admit that this country ought to preserve the straightforward rule of honour in its relations with other nations. But, had not the administration to which he alluded countenanced, on several occasions, and adopted an active interference with foreign nations? Did it not interfere with Spain, with Austria, with Genoa? Did it not permit the spoliation of Norway and Saxony; and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0043"/>
<col>71</col>
was it now, for the first time, that the members of that administration had discovered, that there should be no interference on behalf of the independence of Greece? He was as much opposed as any man to an unnecessary interference; but it was one thing to run headlong into an unnecessary and unwarrantable interference between other countries, and it was another and a very different thing, to stand by and behold, with unfeeling and stupid indifference, the wanton and barbarous effusion of human blood. Interference was in such an instance loudly called for, not only for the interests of humanity, but for the protection of the rights of neutral nations. It was plain and obvious, that any person who admitted the necessity of the treaty of the 6th of July, between the three great powers, could not condemn the battle of Navarino. He could, indeed, understand the man who would object in the first instance, to that treaty, and allege that we had enough to do without meddling in the affairs of other countries. To such a man the affair at Navarino would furnish only an additional argument in support of his reasoning. Why were the combined fleets of England, France, and Russia, assembled in the Mediterranean? After that, were the Greeks and Turks to be allowed to go on? Were the piratical attacks upon the commerce of neutral nations to go on unchecked? Was the assembling of those fleets to be a mere braggadocio&#x2014;an idle menace, intended for no practical purpose? Had Russia, France, and England, of whose honour he would be more chary, entered into a treaty which they never intended to execute? Or was it only to be followed by a display of diplomatical chicanery; and were all further proceedings to be abstained from with fear and trembling, There was, in truth, a great deal of false feeling and false sentiment abroad on this subject. An outcry was raised, by the Jonathan Doubikins of this country, because Turkish blood had been spilled, and Turkish vessels sunk and burnt. There were persons who started with horror at the slightest attack upon our "most faithful" ally, the grand turk. Did they, however, bear in mind the savage butcheries committed at Scio? Were they forgetful of the dreadful effusions of human blood which had taken place, for the last six years, in the fairest portion of Europe? Was it not plain that the object of the
<col>72</col>
horrible warfare carried on there was the extinction of the Greek race in that devoted land? It would be said, that they could know nothing of the treaty, until it was laid before them. It certainly was not on their table; but he, for one, was sufficiently acquainted with it to express his entire approval of it. It was warranted by the circumstances of the case&#x2014;it was conceived in a good spirit&#x2014; it emanated as a love of independence&#x2014; it contained nothing contrary to the law of nations&#x2014;it was the offspring of plain, straight-forward, statesman-like British policy. He did not stand up there to vindicate that which required no vindication&#x2014;the glorious battle of Navarino. No one had insinuated censure against the illustrious commander in that celebrated engagement; his character, therefore, did not stand in need of his feeble eulogy.&#x2014; Having said so much upon this portion of the King's Speech, he would now advert, with feelings of regret, sorrow, and disappointment, to a subject which was altogether omitted in that Speech&#x2014;a matter of which his majesty's councillors seemed to have been quite regardless. He alluded to the reprehensible omission of the name of that country from which he had been deputed to that House, and whose interests it was his duty to protect to the best of his ability. It would appear, from the silence of the Speech, that ministers either cared nothing for, or knew nothing of, the state of Ireland. Did they know, that two thirds of the population of that country were either totally unemployed, or could procure only so much employment as barely gave them the means of subsistence? That there existed discontent in Ireland, no one would be foolhardy enough to deny. Was it known to ministers, that every day hundreds of people were there dispossessed of their lands, and banished from their native country? He would not say that such a measure was not necessary, with a view to the improvement of the condition of the peasantry who remained behind; but, it was a fact notorious as the sun at noon-day, that this depopulating system was going on&#x2014;that men were thrown upon the world without any species of employment or of subsistence, and with starvation and death staring them in the face. There were other features in the present state of Ireland which ought to have drawn the serious attention of ministers to that unfortunate country.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0044"/>
<col>73</col>
Were they aware that, a very short time since, upwards of thirteen hundred parishes assembled, upon the same day and for the same purpose&#x2014;that at the same moment seven millions of people raised their concentrated voices to demand the restoration of their civil rights? Would it then be said, that disappointment and deep discontent did not pervade the population of Ireland? He did expect that the name of Ireland would not have been totally omitted.&#x2014;He did expect that some allusion would have been made to the state of its population, and that it would not have been thus passed over with contemptuous neglect.&#x2014; If he were asked, whether he confided in the present ministry, he would answer, that he had every confidence in the honour of its members. If he agreed upon political subjects with the duke of Wellington, there was no man in whom he would be more ready to confide. But he differed&#x2014; widely differed&#x2014;from the noble duke, with respect to the great question which so nearly affected his native land; and with that difference existing between them, he could not give his support to the noble duke's administration; unless, indeed, he were to desert his political principles, and make a humbug of the Catholic question. Upon that question he had differed with his nearest and dearest friends; and it was not likely that he should relinquish it now. It might be said, that the ministry were neutral upon that question, and that each member of the cabinet was at liberty to vote upon it as he pleased. But, if he were to support such a ministry, what should he, in fact, be doing? As far as his humble vote would go, he should be giving them his support during three hundred and sixty-four days in the year, and then, upon the three hundred and sixty-fifth, he should vote for the Catholic question, while he had been all the while giving his aid to those who were armed with power against it. It might be a very good thing to support ministers; it may be a very pleasant thing to sit on the benches opposite, and to vote with the government. He would give the government his support, whenever it acted in accordance with the principles which he professed, and while its object was the good of the people: but, upon those principles he took his stand, and from those principles he would never depart.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00065"><member>Lord Morpeth</member><membercontribution> said, he perfectly agreed in the sentiments expressed with regard to
<col>74</col>
Ireland, by his hon. friend. No man was better acquainted with that subject and, no one could do it more justice. He had heard with astonishment the expression applied in the Speech from the Throne, to the battle of Navarino. He had also heard the explanation given by the noble Secretary at War, and he would say, that, but for that explanation, the Speech would have excited universal regret. During the last two days, he had carefully considered that explanation; and he was of opinion, that the expression in the Speech, was unjustifiable; unaccompanied as it was, by any distinct denial of political blame, either on the part of the ministers who signed the treaty, or the admiral who fought the battle of Navarino. To the distinguished merits of that gallant officer, cordial testimony had been borne by all sides of the House. But yet, without the explanation of the noble Secretary at War, the obvious inference from the Speech was to the contrary effect. Why use such an ungracious expression, unless it was intended to condemn that which all the good and great hailed with delight? Could the English language apply no other epithet to one of the most brilliant achievements in the naval history of this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00066"><member>Sir G. Warrender</member><membercontribution> bore testimony to the great merits of sir Edward Codrington. He said, it could not but be matter of congratulation with the friends of that gallant officer, that it was unanimously agreed that he had acted with zeal for the honour of his country, and that whatever differences of opinion might exist as to the policy of the measure, all were ready to bear testimony to his exalted merits. Differences of opinion certainly existed as to the political part of the transaction; but by none was sir E. Codrington's conduct impugned. He regretted the language which had been employed by ministers in speaking of the battle of Navarino, and was glad to have heard the explanation of the noble Secretary at War.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00067"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> said, it was not his intention to apply himself to the topics adverted to in the Address. He rose for the purpose of asking the noble Secretary at. War&#x2014; the only knight of king Arthur's round table in the field&#x2014;whether it was the intention of ministers to propose a vote of thanks to sir E. Codrington? and next, whether it was their intention to lay on the table of the House the documents connected with the battle of Navarino, and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0045"/>
<col>75</col>
more particularly the report which he understood had been drawn up by sir John Gore, who had been sent out for the express purpose of inquiring into the particulars of the transaction? That gallant officer had returned; he had seen sir Edward Codrington, and had, of course, made minute inquiries into the details of the battle of Navarino. It, therefore, would be extremely satisfactory to have his report laid before them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00068"><member>Mr. Duncombe</member><membercontribution> rose to bear his testimony to the merits of sir E. Codrington. Whatever might be thought of the circumstances under which the battle of Navarino had been fought, there was but one opinion, as to the bravery, gallantry, and skill, displayed on that occasion. He did not think that the expression used in the Speech from the Throne was intended to impute any censure to those who had signed the treaty of the 6th of July. If it was intended to convey such a meaning, one of those ministers, who now formed a part of the present administration, would never have given his consent to the use of it. He was confident that sir E. Codrington had acted according to the spirit and letter of his instructions; but he could not but think that the battle of Navarino was an untoward event.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00069"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> wished to put a question to the noble Secretary at War. He thought the omission of all mention of Ireland was a proof that ministers were blind to the condition of that country, unless their silence might be explained by motives not now before the House. Three years had elapsed since a message was brought down from the Throne, calling the attention of parliament to the existence of an association in Ireland, said to be pregnant with danger to the constitution, and to the connection between the two countries. The measure introduced as a remedy, had met with the most decided opposition, but, at the same time, with the most anxious attention. In a single se'nnight, it was discussed for five successive nights. That bill expired in the present session, and he wished to know whether it was the intention of government to propose its renewal? From the absence of all notice of the subject, he inferred that it was not their intention; and although he could not applaud their consistency, he could highly praise their wisdom. It might be in the recollection of gentlemen, that on the occasion of the intro-
<col>76</col>
duction of the bill alluded to, it was admitted on all hands, that either such a bill was necessary, or that some other course should be adopted. Now, the bill in question had been tried, and it had totally failed of effect. He should therefore like to know what were the other remedies which government was now disposed to try? He expected that several measures would be introduced by government during the session, to which he should be most happy to lend his support. He would give his support to a system of improvement in the Corn-laws. Though he did not belong to the present government, and though his dearest friends did not belong to it, yet, whenever its measures were right, he would support them. He expected to see them maintain the principles of free trade. As long as the measures proposed by government conduced to the good of the people, they should have his support, whether he sat upon that or upon the opposite side of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00070"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, that before he answered the questions which had been put to him, he hoped the House would allow him to explain the meaning of a certain term in the Speech from the Throne which was still misunderstood. Nobody would be more sorry than he should, to be understood as meaning to say, that blame was imputable to the gallant admiral whose name had been so often alluded to. What he meant to have said, was, that the epithet "untoward event" was not intended to imply the slightest censure on that gallant officer. That epithet had been employed, because the collision between the fleets was unexpected. Whatever merit attached to the military movement itself, there could be no doubt that such a conflict must have had a tendency to interrupt the negotiations which were pending, to produce an alteration in the civil disposition of the Porte, and oppose considerable obstacles to the adjustment of the differences which were under discussion. It was impossible, he thought, to deny, that, in that sense of the word, the battle of Navasino was an "untoward event." But, as far as it related to the character of the country, and to the fame of its arms, no human being could suppose that the epithet "untoward" was applied in that sense. In no fair construction of the passage did it imply any censure on the gallant admiral who commanded on that day.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0046"/>

The hon. member for Westminster had asked, whether it was the intention of government to propose a vote of thanks to the gallant admiral for this victory? In reply, he had only to say, that he was not aware of the existence of any such intention; and for this reason, that it was not usual to propose a vote of thanks for an action of this nature, when not performed in a time of open war between the nations to which the combatants belonged. As to the papers to which the hon. member alluded, it was not, he believed, intended to lay them before parliament. No censure whatever was implied against sir E. Codrington; consequently, no production of papers was necessary for the vindication of a character which no one attacked. To produce papers where conduct was un-impeached would be a novel proceeding; and publication of such documents might have an injurious effect upon negotiations still going on. The next question which had been put to him referred to the views of government with respect to the Catholic Association act. As the administration had only been very recently formed, it had not been possible to give that, as well as other topics, the necessary consideration. With respect to the omission of Ireland in the Speech from the Throne, he could assure the House it was not intended to set aside the strong claims of the sister-country to have her condition fully considered. Whether the government were for or against the Catholic claims, the condition of so large and integral a portion of the kingdom must be an object of serious attention. It was not usual for the King's Speech to advert particularly to any portion of the empire, unless some remarkable change had taken place in its circumstances, subsequent to the preceding meeting of parliament. Nothing had occurred in Ireland during the recess, to call for any marked observation. True it was, that there did unfortunately prevail in Ireland much want of employment; true it was, that plans of emigration were promoted, by arrangements of which he disapproved, and to which he wondered that men of property could have assented; true it was, that there prevailed in that country an intense anxiety to know what were the views of parliament with respect to the Catholic question; but the hon. gentlemen opposite should bear in mind, that an hon. friend of theirs (Mr. W. Lamb), a man of great discretion and
<col>78</col>
conciliatory temper, still continued secretary for Ireland. Surely the continuance of that hon. gentleman in office ought to to be taken as a guarantee, that every means would be taken to calm the angry passions of that part of the kingdom, and, as far as possible, to allay their conflicting animosities. Hon. gentlemen seemed to think, because certain individuals formed a part of the present government who were known to be hostile to the Catholic claims, that therefore the whole influence of that government was to be exercised to give effect to their opinions. Let the House look at the confidential servants of the Crown, and they would find that the majority consisted of supporters of the Catholic claims. How, then, could the administration be said to be constructed on a principle adverse to that measure? For himself he could only say, that if he did not think it was constructed on a principle of fair and honest neutrality upon that question, and that patronage and influence were to be fairly exerted, he, for one, would not longer remain a member of that government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00071"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> said, that, as it was not the intention of government to propose a vote of thanks to admiral Codrington, he now gave notice, that on the 14th of February he would himself introduce such a motion. As to precedent, there was one in point, which it was strange the present administration should have overlooked. He meant that of the vote of thanks to sir Arthur Wellesley, the present prime minister, for his share in the victory at Copenhagen&#x2014;a state which we were, at the time, in friendly alliance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00072"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> said, he did not find fault with the use of the term "untoward" in the king's Speech; especially after the explanation which had been given. He thought the government were justified in their application of the term. He would not, at that moment, question the policy which had led to the battle of Navarino: the time would arrive when the principle of the treaty of London must be discussed. If it were approved of, then they ought to do the admiral justice who had enforced it. He was most anxious to have the whole conduct of that gallant officer inquired into. There was a great dictinction to be drawn between not censuring an officer and praising him. Caution with respect to the latter, might be justifiable until the treaty should be dis-

<col>79</col>
cussed. As to the present administration, he would judge of them by their acts. He saw no reason to doubt their good intentions; nor did he believe the condition of Ireland would be overlooked by them. Changes might possibly take place in the opinions of some persons upon the Catholic question; and, if they should, the country would, he had no doubt, have the benefit of them. They had, in the hon. member for Armagh, one of the purest instances of such a change of opinion. An upright man would always avow such an alteration, when it became the deliberate conviction of his mind. That great question had gained ground in public opinion. The more it was dispassionately canvassed, the greater support it would obtain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00073"><member>Lord Normanby</member><membercontribution> said, that of all the governments he had ever seen, the present was the one which held out the least chance of a favourable consideration of the Catholic claims. A majority in the cabinet afforded no security, when he recollected of what individuals it was composed. Of the noble lord's colleagues friendly to those claims, one of them had not long ago declared that he considered the question not to be of so much importance now as he had formerly attached to it: another noble lord in the cabinet, it was understood, thought the question had better be deferred: while a third noble lord had quitted office last year, only, as it would seem, because he was afraid that too many of his colleagues would be of his own opinion. What was there to balance against this great majority The noble duke at the head of the government was decidedly adverse to any further concessions to the Catholics; and for the first time, since the days of Mr. Perceval, the leader in the House of Commons was also opposed to the Catholic claims. To these facts he could not shut his eyes; nor could he forget what that right hon. gentleman had openly stated in his place last session; namely, that he had quitted office because he could not retain it under Mr. Canning, without giving his support to an administration too friendly to the Catholic question. The right hon. gentleman's return to office was therefore, a great obstacle to the favourable adjustment of that question. That was his only objection to the right hon. gentleman's return to office. There was a report, that it was intended to grant a portion of the Catholic claims. He should be delighted to find it true. Come from whom it might, any
<col>80</col>
measure of concession should receive his support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00074"><member>Mr. M. A. Taylor</member><membercontribution> perfectly agreed that the battle of Navarino was an "untoward event." He considered it a most unfortunate event for this country. He did not deny the talent and skill with which the gallant admiral had fought the battle; but he did question the policy of the instructions under which he had acted. Unless he heard a satisfactory explanation of the grounds of the treaty, it should never have his support. He trusted that tranquillity would be restored with the Porte. The consequences would otherwise be serious. Look at the situation in which we had placed our old ally. Look at the situation in which we had placed Russia and France. View the long-continued policy of the Russian government; and then let the country judge whether the battle of Navarino was not an "untoward event." He was satisfied that this was the general opinion. He was in London when the news of the battle arrived, and he had heard the most anxious fears expressed as to the probable consequences. God grant they might not happen&#x0021; Was there a man in his majesty's government who did not shudder with horror when the news reached him? In no point of view could he approve of the treaty, or of its results.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00075"><member>Lord Euston</member><membercontribution> expressed his approbation of the conduct of the gallant admiral in the battle of Navarino, and lamented that government did not intend to originate a vote of thanks to him, for his skill and valour on that occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00076"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, that while he was ready to admit the inconvenience of going into discussions of this kind at present, he could not help observing, that so far from thinking that the battle of Navarino ought to be described as an "untoward event," he considered it in the highest degree creditable to the character of the country, and that it had raised it in the estimation of the civilized world. He had hoped, that those who had the manliness to have projected the enterprise, would have had the vigour to maintain their position. He was sorry to see them sink beneath the execution of their own conception, and die, as it were, of diffidence, after others had expressed so much satisfaction at what they had done. For his own part, he should when the proper time came, be prepared to defend the policy and the wisdom of every measure connected with
<image src="S2V0018P0I0048"/>
<col>81</col>
the battle of Navarino. He could not too much admire the ability displayed by the admiral and his fleet in the execution of their perilous duty. The admiral was, indeed, beyond the reach of the censure of those who trembled for his act. He had already received the sanction of the executive government, and honours had been bestowed upon him by his sovereign. It was too late, therefore now, to call in question the merit of the achievement. He had executed the provisions of the treaty in the spirit with which it had been originated; and he ought to be thanked, whether there was a precedent or not. If there was, well and good: if not, let the subject be discussed upon its own merits. With respect to the omission of any allusion to Ireland in the King's Speech, the noblelord had informed the House, that that country was in a satisfactory state; or at least that nothing had occurred, since last session, to call for particular notice. He hoped that this would appear to be the case, when Irish subjects should come under discussion. He confessed he entertained different anticipations upon that subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00077"><member>Mr. V. Fitzgerald</member><membercontribution> deprecated discussion at that moment upon questions which must hereafter be debated in a regular form. He would only make a passing allusion to the omission of Ireland in the Speech from the Throne. If he could believe by this omission, that the new government intended to cast aside the consideration of the state of Ireland, he could assure his hon. friend, that he had taken his seat next him, and called for an inquiry into the state of that country. Surely when his hon. friend knew that the government of Ireland was intrusted to such hands as had been alluded to, he could not doubt the desire of the administration to do justice to his country. When the government had only been in office a few days, it was too much to expect that they should be prepared with all those details; unless, indeed, it could be shown, that their predecessors in office had left them matured in their bureaus ready for use. He could not see the necessity for introducing Ireland in the Speech from the Throne, unless circumstances of a peculiar nature demanded a notice of that kind. It had been done when the state of that, country required measures of special rigour; but, happily, such was not now the case. Besides, when it was borne in mind, that the government of that country was confided
<col>82</col>
to those who were appointed by the government which the hon. gentleman approved, and of which he had been a member, where was the necessity for introducing Ireland into the King's Speech? He would not conceal from himself, that, with respect to the great question of Catholic emancipation, much alarm had been excited in Ireland by the change in his majesty's councils; but when they recollected the opinion which had been stated in that House, by those who had presided over succeeding administrations; namely, that the success of this important question could not be hastened, but might be retarded, by being made a cabinet question, then those who admitted this could not fairly complain that it was not mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. He would not place the success of this question on the balance of votes in the cabinet. It was, in his opinion, an unwise and unworthy mode of treating a great public question, which had marched forward by the force of public opinion. Most of them must have seen it rise from minority and defeat in that House, to success and triumph; and, what was still more remarkable, they had seen it, by degrees, gaining a victory over the public mind, and winning the support of those who had long opposed it. Therefore he contended, that it was an unworthy and an unwise way to balance its success on the votes in the cabinet. If there was one characteristic which, more than another, distinguished the noble person at the head of his majesty's councils, and which was almost as conspicuous as the talents that had accumulated glories of imperishable lustre around him, it was his firmness, his straight-forwardness, his honesty of character. Whatever might be the fate of this question,&#x2014;whatever course might be taken with respect to it&#x2014; he had proved, that the influence of the Crown should not be exerted on the occasion. He had evinced this feeling, by retaining in the councils of the country, some of the most distinguished champions of Catholic emancipation. The only two new members of it held, upon this subject, the same opinions; they had both proved themselves to be sincere advocates of Catholic emancipation. He must consider those individuals to be in error, who would embattle against the present government all who supported the Catholic question, because that government was divided upon the question. He trusted, however, that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0049"/>
<col>83</col>
they would pause before they determined to take such a course, and that they would riot retard a cause which had been advanced by discussion, and which, by discussion alone, would be ultimately successful.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EAST RETFORD DISFRANCHISEMENT<lb/> &#x2014;AND REPRESENTATION OF BIRMINGHAM.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00084"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> rose for the purpose of re-introducing a bill which the House had adopted, and read a second time, at the close of the last session, for disfranchising the borough of East Retford, and giving representation to Birmingham. He was aware that some gentlemen thought evidence should be produced at the bar, in addition to that taken before the Retford Election committee, on which the House had proceeded last year. He knew also, that other gentlemen entertained different views from himself, as to the destination of the franchise, if it should be removed from East Retford. He had
<col>84</col>
thought the proper course was, td resume the subject in that shape, substantially, in which it had been left in the last session: he had, however, added to the bill provisions calculated to obviate the tumult, delay, and expense, Which formed the chief objections to the representation of large towns. As to the production of further evidence, he was fully prepared with it, if the House should desire to have additional satisfaction with regard to the corrupt state of East Retford; but as the committee upon the bill would be the proper stage for that evidence, if required, as well as for any discussion with regard to the place td which the privilege of returning members td parliament should be eventually transferred, he would not how detain the House by any further observations, but simply move for leave to bring in a bill, "to exclude the borough of East Retford from electing burgesses to serve in parliament, and to enable the town of Birmingham to return two representatives to parliament in lieu thereof."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00085"><member>Mr. George Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, that the circumstances of this case were of a very peculiar nature. The committee which sat to consider the merits of the election for East Retford commenced their labours in the month of May last, and terminated them at the end of that month; and, by virtue of the power of suspending the writ, which the House possessed, that borough had since remained unrepresented. It was acknowledged that the Writ was suspended; that the gentlemen who had set up for the borough were unseated, writ for bribery, but for treating; which was a very inferior offence. Now, if that were, the only offence against those who seated them, and, if no charge of bribery were substantiated against those gentlemen, it was clear that there could have been no suspension of the writ. But the committee made a special report with respect to bribery having been committed on former occasions, and also with reference to its having been expected on this, by those who concurred in electing the then members. No bribery was either brought home to the members or to the electors. The members were, however, unseated by the suspension of the writ, and the consequence was, that there was no person in the House connected with the borough, or interested in investigating the business. He knew how inefficient an advocate he should prove, if he offered to take up the cause
<image src="S2V0018P0I0050"/>
<col>85</col>
of this party; but, having been nominee on the election committee, and, therefore, better acquainted with the circumstances of the case than the members generally, he considered it his duty to call the attention of the House, from time to time, to the circumstances, for the purpose of defending the interests of those who would otherwise stand alone. He had no connexion with the borough; no knowledge of the parties; and no acquaintance with the gentlemen for whom he acted as nominee: he only wished that justice should be done, and especially if the offence were fully proved, of the commission of which there was certainly full and pregnant suspicion. He conceived that the House would act with injustice, if it proceeded on the present evidence. What was the conclusion to which the committee had come? The result clearly proved, that they did not believe the evidence; for, if they had believed it, it was impossible that they should not have come to the conclusion, that bribery had been committed. It was decided by a large majority of the committee, that the members were not guilty of bribery; and, when the evidence was thus, in a great measure, discredited by those who had the best means of judging of it; when it did not bring home the charge of bribery; were they prepared to say, that, because it was bad and inefficient for one purpose, it was good for another? It was, therefore, impossible to say that the present evidence formed a fit ground for disfranchising this borough, and depriving individuals of their rights. Persons, be their situation high or low, found guilty of this offence, ought to be punished; but the House ought to be slow in coming to any hasty conclusion. His learned friend himself would not, he was sure, press that evidence on the House, as the groundwork of condemnation. He did not speak of all the evidence. The witnesses were of different descriptions; but those who spoke of acts of violence were very much, if not wholly, discredited. The charge, in this case, was certainly of a grave nature. It was, that a strong suspicion existed that bribes were expected on this occasion; as, on several former occasions, bribes had been expected, and were received. Now, the evidence that applied to former transactions ought to be received with great caution; because those who had been accused on former occasions had no counsel to defend them. Under
<col>86</col>
these circumstances, he thought they ought to pause, and hear all the evidence again, before they acted upon it. He entreated his learned friend to proceed with as little delay as possible; because, as they were taught that persons accused were presumed to be innocent until they were found guilty, it was evident that this case of the burgesses of East Retford was rather a hard one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00086"><member>Mr. Batley</member><membercontribution> agreed, generally, with what had fallen from the hon. gentleman who had spoken last; but he would go a point further, and would say, that he did not see the justice of disfranchising a borough, merely because it could be proved that some forty or fifty of the voters had given their votes with an expectation of being-bribed for so doing. The members who had been returned had been acquitted of bribery, and that was a material point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00087"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> replied. He assured his hon. friend (Mr. G. Bankes) of his anxiety to bring the subject under consideration to an early conclusion; not only on account of the important interests involved, but of the desire which he felt, in common with every gentleman who had the conduct of a public bill, to be speedily relieved from his labours. He would not then enter upon any reply to the numerous observations of his hon. friend, as a more fit opportunity would occur for the discussions to which they would lead, but, in consequence of what had fallen from both the hon. members who had spoken, he felt it right to remind the House, that the ground on which the House allowed him to proceed with this bill in the last session was&#x2014;not any specific bribery at the last election for East Retford&#x2014;but the systematic corruption which had prevailed there for a series of elections past, and as far back as the memory of man extended, which rendered the electors totally unfit to be further trusted with the franchise. Of this corruption he repeated, that, if the House was not satisfied already, he was prepared with proofs so ample and conclusive, that he expected its unanimous concurrence with regard to the disfranchisement of East Retford.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00090" align="center">PROTOCOL relative to the Affairs of Greece. <i>Signed at St. Petersburgh,</i> April 4, 1826. (TRANSLATION.)</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00091">His Britannic Majesty having been requested by the Greeks to interpose his good offices, in order to obtain their reconciliation with the Ottoman Porte; having, in consequence, offered his Mediation to that Power, and being desirous of concerting the measures of his Government, upon this subject, with his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias; and his Imperial Majesty, on the other hand, being equally animated by the desire of putting an end to the contest of which Greece and the Archipelago are the theatre, by an arrangement, which shall be consistent with the principles of religion, justice, and humanity;</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00092">The Undersigned have agreed:</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00093">1. That the arrangement to be proposed to the Porte, if that Government should accept the proffered Mediation, should have for its object, to place the Greeks to wards the Ottoman Porte, in the relation hereafter mentioned:</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00094">Greece should be a dependency of that Empire, and the Greeks should pay to the Porte an annual tribute, the amount of which should be permanently fixed by common consent. They should be exclusively governed by Authorities, to be chosen and named by themselves, but in the nomination of which Authorities the Porte should have a certain influence.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00095">In this state, the Greeks should enjoy a complete liberty of conscience, entire freedom of commerce, and should, exclusively, conduct their own internal government.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00096">In order to effect a complete separation between individuals of the two nations, and to prevent the collisions which must be the necessary consequences of a contest of such duration, the Greeks should purchase the property of Turks, whether situated on the Continent of Greece, or in the Islands.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00097">2. In case the principle of a Mediation between Turks and Greeks should have been admitted, in consequence of the steps taken, with that view, by his Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, his Imperial Majesty would exert, in every case, his influence to forward the object of that Mediation. The mode in which, and the time at which, his Imperial Majesty should take part in the ulterior nego-
<col>88</col>
tiations with the Ottoman Porte, which maybe the consequence of that Mediation, should be determined hereafter by the common consent of the governments of his Britannic Majesty and his Imperial Majesty.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00098">3. If the Mediation offered by his Britannic Majesty should not have been accepted by the Porte, and whatever may be the nature of the relations between his Imperial Majesty and the Turkish government, his Britannic Majesty and his Imperial Majesty will still consider the terms of the arrangement specified in No. 1 of this Protocol, as the basis of any reconciliation to be effected by their intervention, whether in concert or separately, between the Porte and the Greeks; and they will avail themselves of every favour able opportunity to exert their influence with both Parties, in order to effect their reconciliation on the above-mentioned basis.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00099">4.That his Britannic Majesty and his Imperial Majesty should reserve to them selves to adopt, hereafter, the measures necessary for the settlement of the details of the arrangement in question, as well as the limits of the Territory, and the names of the Islands of the Archipelago to which it shall be applicable, and which it shall be proposed to the Porte to comprise under the denomination of Greece.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00100">5. That, moreover, his Britannic Majesty and his Imperial Majesty will not seek, in this arrangement, any increase of Territory, nor any exclusive influence, nor advantage in commerce for their Subjects, which shall not be equally attainable by all other Nations.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00101">6. That his Britannic Majesty and his Imperial Majesty, being desirous that their Allies should become parties to the definitive arrangements of which this Protocol contains the outline, will communicate this Instrument, confidentially, to the Courts of Vienna, Paris, and Berlin, and will propose to them that they should, in concert with the Emperor of Russia, guarantee the treaty by which the reconciliation of Turks and Greeks shall be effected, as his Britannic Majesty cannot guarantee such a Treaty.

<p id="S2V0018P0-00116">This offer of Mediation shall be made to that Power immediately after the Ratification of the present Treaty, by means of a joint declaration, signed by Plenipotentiaries of the Allied Courts at Constantinople; and, at the same time, a demand for an immediate Armistice shall be made to the Two Contending Parties, as a preliminary and indispensable condition to the opening of any negotiation.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00117">2. The arrangement to be proposed to the Ottoman Porte shall rest upon the following bases: &#x2014;</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00118">The Greeks shall hold under the Sultan as under a Lord paramount; and, in consequence thereof, they shall pay to the Ottoman empire an annual tribute, the amount of which shall be fixed, once for all, by common agreement. They shall be governed by Authorities whom they shall choose and appoint themselves, but in the nomination of whom the Porte shall have a defined right.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00119">In order to effect a complete separation betwen the individuals of the two Nations, and to prevent the collisions which would be the inevitable consequence of so protracted a struggle, the Greeks shall become possessors of all Turkish Property situated either upon the Continent, or in the Islands of Greece, on condition of indemnifying the former proprietors, either by an annual sum to be added to the tribute which they shall pay to the Porte, or by some other arrangement of the same nature.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00120">3. The details of this arrangement, as well as the limits of the territory upon the Continent, and the designation of the Islands of the Archipelago to which it shall be applicable, shall be settled by a nego-

tiation to be hereafter entered into between the High Powers and the Two Contending Parties.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00121">4. The Contracting Powers engage to pursue the salutary work of the pacification, of Greece, upon the bases laid down in the preceding Articles, and to furnish, without the least delay, their Representatives at Constantinople with all the Instructions which are required for the execution of the Treaty which they now sign.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00122">5. The Contracting Powers will not peek, in these arrangements, any augmentation of territory, any exclusive influence, or any commercial advantage for their Subjects, which those of every other Nation may not equally obtain.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00123">6. The arrangements for reconciliation and peace which shall be definitively agreed upon between the Contending Parties, shall be guaranteed by those of the Signing Powers who may judge it expedient or possible to contract that obligation. The operation and the effects of such guarantee shall become the subject of future stipulation between the High Powers.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00124">7. The present Treaty shall be ratified, and the ratifications shall be exchanged in two months, or sooner if possible. In witness whereof, the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the same, and have affixed thereto the Seals of their Arms. Done at London, the Sixth day of July, in the Year of our Lord, 1827.</p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00128">Additional Article.&#x2014;In case the Ottoman Porte should not, within the space of one month, accept the mediation which is to be proposed to It, the High Contracting Parties agree upon the following measures: &#x2014;</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00129">1. It shall be declared to the Porte, by Their Representatives at Constantinople, that the inconveniencies and evils described in the patent Treaty as inseparable from the state of things which has, for six years, existed in the East, and the termination of which, by the means at the command of the Sublime Ottoman Porte, appears to be still distant, impose upon the High Contracting Parties the necessity of taking immediate measures for forming a connection with the Greeks.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00130">It is understood that this shall be effected by establishing commercial rela-
<col>92</col>
tions with the Greeks, and by sending to and receiving from them, for this, purpose. Consular Agents, provided there shall exist in Greece Authorities capable of supporting such relations.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00131">2. If, within the said term of one month, the Porte does not accept the armistice proposed in the first article of the patent Treaty, or if the Greeks refuse to carry it into execution, the high contracting powers shall declare to either of the contending parties which may be disposed to continue hostilities, or to both of them, if necessary, that the said high powers intend to exert all the means which circumstances may suggest to their prudence, for the purpose of obtaining the immediate effects of the armistice of which they desire the execution, by preventing, as far as possible, all collision between the contending parties; and in consequence, immediately after the above mentioned declaration, the high powers will, jointly, exert all their efforts to accomplish the object of such armistice, without, however, taking any part in the hostilities between the two contending parties.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00132">Immediately after the signature of the present additional article, the high contracting powers will, consequently, transmit to the admirals commanding their respective squadrons in the Levant, conditional instructions in conformity to the arrangements above declared.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00133">3. Finally, if, contrary to all expectation, these measures do not prove sufficient to procure the adoption of the propositions of the high contracting parties by the Ottoman Porte; or if, on the other hand, the Greeks decline the conditions stipulated in their favour, by the Treaty of this date, the high contracting powers will, nevertheless, continue to pursue the work of pacification, on the bases upon which they have agreed; and, in consequence, they authorise, from the present moment, their representatives at London, to discuss and determine the future measures which it may become necessary to employ.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00134">The present additional article shall have the same force and validity as if it were inserted, word for word, in the Treaty of this day. It shall be ratified, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at the same time as those of the said Treaty.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00135">In witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed the same, and

<title>ROMAN CATHOLIC ASSOCIATION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00140"><member>The Marquis of Londonderry</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to offer a few words on the subject connected with the Roman Catholics of Ireland. As a friend to them and to their cause, it was impossible for him to see without anxiety the public journals teeming with such monstrous resolutions as those which had been submitted to an assembly of persons calling themselves the meeting of the Roman Catholics of Ireland. Their lordships would recollect, that a bill had been passed to put down such associations. Notwithstanding that bill, these associations continued to exist, and a resolution had been laid before them of so extraordinary a nature, that it was impossible for him not to allude to it; for if that resolution was actually the resolution of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, he, as one of their sincerest friends, would declare, that instead of making him hope that their cause would advance, it would give him reason to wish that it might not. Precisely the same sentiment he had expressed two years ago. He had then said, that if he thought the Catholics of Ireland would, by intimidation or threat, endeavour to carry their object, he would be the first to oppose them. The resolution to which he had alluded was as follows:&#x2014;"Resolved; that we feel it a duty we owe to the Irish people to declare, that we shall consider every Irish member of parliament an enemy to the freedom, peace, and happiness, of Ireland, who shall support, either directly or indirectly, any administration of which the duke of Wellington, or any individual professing his principles, is the head or contriver; and we call on all counties, cities, towns, and parishes in Ireland, to act upon the spirit of this resolution." Now, he must look upon this resolution as a complete threat; but he believed that the Catholics of Ireland would not approve of it. He was sure that a better spirit prevailed amongst them. If such proceedings, however, were suffered to continue, they would be
<col>94</col>
the means of prejudicing the cause of the Catholics in the eyes of their friends. He was convinced that the resolution would have no effect on the conduct of any person, and that every member would join with him in reprobating it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00141"><member>Lord Clifden</member><membercontribution> said, that no man was less disposed than he was to countenance such proceedings, but still he thought that some allowance ought to be made for the use of intemperate language. He agreed, that many things which had been said by members of the Catholic association had displeased the friends of their cause; but their lordships ought not to look at a great public question under feelings excited by the intemperate harangues of this man or of that. The king of the Netherlands had entered into an arrangement with the Pope, respecting his Catholic subjects. Why could not we do the same? It was not to be wondered at, if intemperate language should break forth from a people whose hopes had been deferred for seven and twenty years. It was not in human nature to put up with such injustice.</membercontribution></p>

The papers which his noble friend the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, had brought down the other day, were highly satisfactory as showing a disposition, on the part of his majesty's government, to give every information on the subject to which the papers referred. They nevertheless, appeared to him to be incomplete. He therefore gave notice, that, he intended to move for the production of certain papers on Monday next. His motion would comprise two objects: first, to ascertain the state of the relations between this country and the Ottoman Porte; and next, the nature of the instructions given to the admiral commanding the combined fleet in the Mediterranean.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00144"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> asked, whether it was the intention of the noble lord to call upon the House to vote any of the supplies for the current year before, the chancellor of the Exchequer had taken his seat?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00145"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, it was his intention to move only for certain supplies out of funds, which were not strictly available without the authority of the House. His object was to prevent the obstruction of the public service from the want of those funds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00146"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that with regard to any balance which might remain in the Treasury from last year, he had no objection that government should bring it forward to meet the current expenses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00147"><member>Mr. Maberly</member><membercontribution> trusted, that when the estimates were brought forward, they would evince a due attention to economy in every department of the state. It would be impossible for the finance committee to make any report until a late period of the session.

The hon. member dwelt upon the beneficial effects which would flow from such a measure. The principle upon which the bill was founded was not a novel one. It had frequently been applied in the instances of private bills; and he wished to extend
<col>96</col>
it to parishes. At present, no parish could adopt this useful system of commutation without making a special application to parliament; and the enormous expense attendant upon such application rendered it, in many instances, impracticable. By the intended bill commissioners would be appointed; and to prevent fraud or collusion, one of those commissioners would be the clergyman of the parish: all their proceedings would be public, and every party interested would have an opportunity of informing himself of the acts done by the commissioners and the tithe valuators</membercontribution></p>

There was one point connected with the numerous classes of persons, of whom the petitioners formed a branch, on which he was anxious to say a few words. It had been stated in the newspapers and elsewhere, that the Dissenters had coalesced with the Catholics, for the purpose of obtaining, in conjunction, the removal of their mutual disabilities. Now, he was authorised positively to state, that they had done no such thing. A united committee had been appointed by the Dissenters, to whom was intrusted the management of the application to parliament for a repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts. That committee, which, he could say, without fear of contradic-

tion, spoke the sentiments of the Dissenters at large, had that very day entered into the following resolution: "The United Committee of Dissenters, acting on their own best judgment, and under the recommendation of many of their parliamentary friends, have come to the resolution, that it is not expedient for the Dissenters to unite their applications to parliament with those of the Roman Catholics; but they distinctly disavow the inference, that their acting separately, and independently, proceeds from any hostility to the claims of that numerous and respectable body." He could say, from his own knowledge, that there never was a more scandalous calumny than the statement which had been so frequently made, that the Dissenters, as a body, were adverse to the claims of the Roman Catholics.</membercontribution></p>

<title>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY&#x2014;CHANGE OF<lb/> ADMINISTRATION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00157"><member>Lord Palmerston</member> moved the order of the day, for going into a Committee of Supply.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00158"><member>Mr. Liddell</member><membercontribution> said, that as it was one of the most important rights which a member of that House possessed, to deliver his opinions on such an occasion as the present, he trusted that no apology was necessary, when he stood up to express, in as few words as possible, his sentiments on the situation in which the government was placed, and to declare the grounds on which alone he could give it is humble support. If any such apology were necessary, it was, he conceived, to be found in the fact, that in the last twelve months the country had seen various important changes in the ministry: that during that period there had been no fewer than four different prime ministers. Twelve months had not gone over their heads since the great struggle took place between Mr. Canning and the powerful party by whom he was opposed, and who, though then defeated, had again gained the ascendancy. Many of those who stood by Mr. Canning in that time of trial had ceased to have any connexion with the ministry: a few of them still remained in authority, For himself, he could truly say, that no man was a more ardent admirer, no man a more cordial supporter, of Mr. Canning. It was true that that great man was no more: they no longer had the benefit of his experience and his talents; but it was to be
<col>98</col>
hoped that his example would still be useful to his country,&#x2014;that the <i>mens divinior</i> which accompanied him through his splendid career, had shed a light on our foreign and domestic policy, which would serve to guide those by whom he had been succeeded. Although, by the death of that lamented individual, the main strength of the existing administration was withdrawn, it should have had his feeble support; but he was sorry to say that it had not proceeded with the vigour which might have been expected, and that it suffered itself to be dissolved, untouched by any hostile collision. He now came to the period when, called on by the monarch, the present cabinet was formed by the noble duke who was placed at its head. For that illustrious individual, no man could entertain a higher feeling of admiration. He had been the saviour of his country in the most arduous crisis that she had ever experienced. By his admirable conduct in the field, he had given peace to desolated Europe, and had justly earned the gratitude of his country. But, in spite of that noble duke's unquestionable abilities, he could not view his translation from the post of commander-in-chief of the army, to that of first lord of the Treasury with satisfaction. His original part was so well cast, his value to the army was so well known, that the public opinion was united on this point, that he could not be placed in a more proper situation than that which, as a military man, he so ably and advantageously filled. He therefore regretted, as he believed the country in general did, that the change had taken place. The duke of Wellington himself must have felt some repugnance at the situation in which he had been placed. It was reported, and the report had not been denied, that Mr. Canning had written to the duke, and had pointed out the incompatibility of his holding the two offices which he had subsequently filled. In the propriety of the sentiments contained in that letter, the noble duke was said to have agreed. In the House of Lords last session, the noble duke had himself declared, that he could not, with propriety, fill the two situations. This was upon record;<sup>*</sup> and he trusted that the noble duke would not act differently in the present year from the sentiments which he had uttered in the last. Highly as he
<quote><sup>*</sup> See vol. xvii. P. 461.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0057"/>
<col>99</col>
thought of the noble duke's abilities, and of his firm character, still he could not bring himself to believe that he possessed those Atlean shoulders, which would enable him to support the whole weight of the administration, together with the duties of the War-office. The noble duke had gained fame and credit for the British army, he had added honour and renown to his country as a warrior, but it did not therefore follow that his talents were adapted to the situation which he now held. There was another gentleman connected with the present administration, relative to whom he wished to say a word or two. He alluded to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. The return of that right hon. gentleman to office was hailed with satisfaction by a large portion of the public, but, upon one important question, he held sentiments exceedingly different from those held by that right hon. gentleman. He was aware that it was precisely on account of the line of conduct pursued by him in reference to that topic, that the right hon. gentleman was looked upon by very many loyal and well-meaning subjects as one of the main pillars of the state. But he must say, that if the right hon. gentleman's claims to the confidence of the country were founded upon no other grounds than his policy upon that question, what appeared to others to constitute him a pillar of the state, operated as a barrier of exclusion to thousands, nay millions, of their fellow-subjects, who had for years been waiting at the threshold of the constitution, imploring to be admitted beneath its roof. He hoped that the principles of free trade would not be abandoned. He was desirous to see those principles acted upon, with judicious modifications. With regard to Ireland, something, he felt, must be done for that distracted country. Concession ought to be resorted to, not coercion. If any measures of a coercive nature were brought forward before concession was tried to its fullest extent, such measures should have his reprobation. It was time for them to shape their course anew&#x2014;to choose between peace and war, loyalty and rebellion, tranquillity and convulsion. The course which he had described was the only one which he could support, with justice to his own character, and to the desire which he should always entertain of preserving the confidence of his constituents.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00159">The House having resolved itself into the committee, lord Palmerston moved, "That a Supply be granted to his Majesty."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00160"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> hoped that, before any money was asked for on account of the supply, the whole of the estimates for the year would be laid before the House. Nothing could be more disadvantageous than the practice of calling for money, and obtaining it, by dribblets, while the House was in ignorance of what the extent of the demand would be. He should certainly oppose any grant, until all the charges for the year were on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00161"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, that the estimates for the more considerable sources of expense, the army, navy, and ordnance, would be upon the table before any vote was proposed; but some of the less important accounts, it was impossible to have ready until a later period in the session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00162"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> saw nothing impossible in the case, and thought it absolutely necessary that the miscellaneous estimates should be produced before any money was voted. These last accounts generally amounted to two or three millions. If ever there was a time when it was necessary to adopt a clear mode of proceeding with regard to the finances, the present was that moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00163"><member>Mr. Maberly</member><membercontribution> said, that the miscellaneous estimates had, of late years, arisen to an alarming height. He therefore hoped, that as the country had got a new ministry, every facility would be afforded the House for watching the progress of these expenses. He would oppose every grant, until the whole of the estimates for the year should be known.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00164"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, that the army, navy, and ordnance estimates, being founded upon the cost of existing establishments, were capable of being furnished early. The miscellaneous estimates, as there was more information necessary to calculate them, could not be produced so soon in the session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00165"><member>Sir. J. Sebright</member><membercontribution> hoped that the House would vote no money until the whole of the estimates were before them. It was now necessary to look to the expenditure, not only of every million, but of every shilling of the public money. He pressed this point the more, because he understood that large expenses had been recently incurred for which there was no sufficient warrant. He alluded to the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0058"/>
<col>101</col>
sums which had been laid out in the repairs at Windsor, and in the improvement of the parks. He had not opposed the vote for the repairs of Windsor castle; but that vote had been limited to a specific sum. He had heard, that that sum had been very far exceeded; and he thought it fit that the House should know upon what authority the expense in question had been undertaken, and to what length it had extended. He trusted that the House would try the possibility of producing the miscellaneous accounts by refusing to vote any money until they were upon the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00166"><member>Mr. G. Dawson</member><membercontribution> said, he was satisfied, that there was no disposition to withhold from the House any estimates; and that the whole would be furnished with all possible expedition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00167"><member>Sir J. Sebright</member><membercontribution> expressed his satisfaction at the assurances thus given. A new administration was now commencing its operations, and it could not do any thing that would be more satisfactory to the public, than by promoting inquiry into these subjects. He had not risen with any feeling of enmity towards the present administration. It had never been his practice to enter the ranks of opposition to a government; and, on the other hand, he had never ranged himself as a supporter of any, except that of the late Mr. Canning. Then, indeed, he had thought it his duty to support, as far as he could, an administration which he considered likely to be so beneficial to the country. But it did not follow that the new administration should find an opponent in him. Many persons objected to the duke of Wellington as rime minister. So for as that appointment went it had his warmest approbation. One of the objections urged against the noble duke's fitness for that office was, that he had passed a great portion of his life in military service. So far from looking upon that as a disqualifying circumstance, he was of opinion that the noble duke could not have been brought up in a better school. He had always had great objects before him to decide upon, and great interests to consider; and those habits of command would qualify him better for the leader of an administration, than a mere acquaintance with the routine of office. In the noble duke the country would at least find habits of decision; which was a point of first-rate consideration in the character of every minister; and he (sir J. Sebright) doubted not, that
<col>102</col>
by a sedulous restriction of the expenditure of the country, as far as was consistent, the noble duke would become as popular' a minister, as he already was a general.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00168"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> said, that the repairs of Windsor Castle had undoubtedly exceeded the estimate; but that excess had not arisen out of change, in the original plan, but from the state of the general building; which had been found in a condition which could not be foreseen when the estimate was framed. He believed it would be fully proved, that no blame rested upon the commissioners, or upon the architect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00169"><member>Sir Joseph Yorke</member><membercontribution> said, it was so much the object of the hon. member for Aberdeen to object to a supply being granted as to have the means of squaring the general expenditure of the country with its income. No doubt it was necessary to support the army and the navy; and there were some extras which it was equally necessary to support; but he hoped the new government would set to work, and take care, while they supported what was right, to lop off what was superfluous and extravagant. He could not agree with the hon. baronet, who was so pleased that they had got a military man to reign over them. He had rather it had been some one else. It was quite a choaker to him. He had no doubt as to the noble duke's decision of character, and that he would be able to keep the cabinet in good order [a laugh]; and he wished his noble relation had had a little of the same sort of spunk. Still he did not feel the military school the best school for a statesman. Nevertheless, if the noble duke laid by his habits of the sword a little he might make a good and a popular minister. As for his not being in the habit of making long speeches, he considered that circumstance a particularly fortunate one; two thirds of that which was called eloquence only tended to blink the question at issue.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ROMAN CATHOLIC LAND-TAX BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00171"><member>Mr. George Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, that he rose to ask leave to bring in a bill, to which he could anticipate no objection. The question had been, brought before the legislature thirty years ago, with the intention of remedying the defect to which his motion now had reference. Last session he had had the honour of introducing a similar bill to the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0059"/>
<col>103</col>
House; and had it not been for the abrupt ermination of the session, he had no doubt that it would have met with the same success in the other House as it had done n that. But whether or no such would nave been the case, he had at least a right to anticipate that there was a feeling in its favour. He was aware that there were some difficulties in the way of the measure, but he did not anticipate that they would be sufficient to negative the bill; and he trusted that, by the attention of parliament, those difficulties might be removed. It was not on his own suggestion, but of others, that he offered this bill to the notice of the House; and he requested to call their attention to the petition which had been presented from the Roman Catholics, complaining of the disadvantages under which they laboured on that account; and he did so the rather, as the petition was not only numerously signed, but likewise by persons of consideration and consequence, amongst whom were the names of lords Shrewsbury, Dormer, Stafford, sir T. Stanley, sir R. Bedding-field, and others. The law respecting the land-tax had been passed in the 4th of William and Mary, in the year 1692; and the rate imposed by it was 4<i>s</i>. in the pound on all landed estates throughout the kingdom, but those who should refuse to take certain oaths; so that, by this arrangement, the Catholics were burthened, without any relief being afforded to the Protestants. The law continued in this state till the year 1794; when it was first proposed to exempt the Catholics from this very unjust penalty. But the legislature, had not rightly considered the origin of the act; and, therefore, they had not adopted the proper method of affording relief. It was not fair that what was taken off the Catholics should be thrown upon the rest of the kingdom; and for that reason, as the land-tax had never been raised generally on the whole kingdom, but on divisions of hundreds, which were made in the time of William, and were continued to the present day, the parliament had found itself placed in a difficulty. The consequence had been, that it was expressly provided by that act, that the deficiency should not be thrown upon the public at large, but confined to the division in which the reduction took place. This, however, had been found by experience to be so embarrassing, that except in those divisions where fresh lands
<col>104</col>
had been inclosed, no relief at all was afforded; and instances had actually occurred, where, a Catholic being possessed of the whole hundred, it was impossible that the arrangement could be of any benefit to him, as there was none but his own land on which he might throw it. This act had continued in operation through 1795 and 1796, until the year 1797, when the Land Tax Redemption act was introduced; and in that a clause had been inserted, which, it was supposed, would be adequate to the difficulty: but it had again been found inefficient. In cases where the hundreds were charged at more than 4<i>s</i>. in the pound, it was competent to certain commissioners to reduce the amount; but this was no benefit to the Catholics, for there were very few places in the kingdom where the rate was so high as 4<i>s</i>. The total sum raised in king William's time was about two millions; and as only the same amount was collected now, it was clear that there was no necessity for so high a rate as then, as the value of lands since those times had increased prodigiously; and, consequently, a rate of from one to two shillings was on the average sufficient to cover the amount required. This was the outline of the grievance of which the Roman Catholics complained; and he could not but suppose that it was a real grievance, as he did not conceive that so many noblemen and gentlemen would petition parliament against an imaginary evil; and if the House, as he did, believed it to be true, he had no doubt that it would join with him most cordially in endeavouring to do away with the injustice. Perhaps it would be said, that the land-tax was unequally raised throughout the country&#x2014;that in some places a rate of one penny or two-pence was required, and in others a rate of two shillings from Protestants: he did not deny that this was the case; but how it had originated it was not easy to decide. It was alleged by some, that their ancestors, when the tax was first proposed, were so loyal and well-affected towards king William, that they consented to pay a higher rate than they need to have done, and felt pride in contributing more than was necessary; though, perhaps, the reason might be more fairly found in the fact, that those counties where the land-tax was most heavy, were the home counties; which in those days were richer and better able to pay than the midland and more northern
<image src="S2V0018P0I0060"/>
<col>105</col>
counties, which, compared with what they are now, were very poor. But, whether the inequality arose from these or any other causes, he could not think that, because the Protestants were not equally assessed, the Catholics were entitled to no relief. The principle of the measure he was about to propose had already been avowed by parliament; and if it could find any way of getting rid of the grievance, he was persuaded the House would do so. That it was practicable he firmly believed; and he wished it to be understood, that he only proposed to relieve those cases where a specific grievance could be proved: but it would not answer the purpose of those whose cause he was then advocating, to be put back as they had been in 1794; for, although that bill had proposed to afford them relief, it had done no such thing. It was not until the subject had been repeatedly pressed upon his notice, that he consented to undertake the task, but he felt himself bound to say, that he did so with unqualified pleasure. The hon. gentleman then moved, "That leave be given to bring in a bill to relieve Roman Catholics from double assessments to the Land Tax."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00172"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution>, in seconding the motion, said, he had heard that the payments of the family of only one Catholic gentleman, sir Richard Beddingfield, had amounted, under this double assessment, to 50,000<i>l</i>. The act under which the Catholics were supposed to receive relief in these cases empowered the commissioners to apportion the sum thus taken off the lands of the Catholics, upon the property of other persons in the same township or district. That course had been successfully followed by the commissioners, of which an hon. friend near him (Mr. Hurst) was one, in the district of Horsham, and he believed without any inconvenience or complaint; but, in other parts of the country, from whence the complaints now came, he had heard it was impossible to give such relief under any act which had been passed upon the subject. The late secretary to the Treasury, had distinctly declared, when the government were applied to on the subject, that no relief could be afforded to the Catholics which would not produce a loss to the Treasury to the full amount of that double land-tax from which the Catholic might be exempted. So many changes had taken place, since 1798, in the state of the property subject to the land-tax; so much of it had changed possessors; so
<col>106</col>
much of it had been redeemed; that any attempt to spread the burthen of the double tax upon other parts of the same district, would be found impossible. Now that the evil was known, and that it was evident no remedy existed, the House must see the propriety of acceding to the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00173"><member>Mr. Hurst</member><membercontribution> said, he had acted in the capacity of a commissioner, and had been enabled to relieve some families who had been assessed for the double tax from the time of king William. Great difficulties at first occurred in throwing the sum upon any other property; but after a laborious investigation, the commissioners discovered lands which had never been taxed at all; and upon them they imposed the burthen from which they relieved those who sought relief under the act. But he apprehended that great difficulties must attend such, experiments elsewhere; and as the whole amount of this double tax was small, he apprehended there could be no objection to grant the relief proposed by the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00174"><member>Mr. Curteis</member><membercontribution> said, there had been a manifest disposition on the part of the legislature to relieve the Catholics from this double assessment. The manner in which a similar measure was suffered to pass last session, was extremely indecorous. The House was not aware of the extent of the sacrifice which this bill required. If, as he believed, relief was to be had under the act at present existing, and without any sacrifice of revenue, he saw no reason why they should assent to the proposed bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00175"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> thought, that, if there was any case in which economical considerations should be disregarded, it was that which involved in its execution an act of positive cruelty and injustice. The House was not only called upon to grant the boon required upon every principle of justice, but in accordance with a principle recognized by a previous act of parliament. They were not now called upon to grant a relief which ought not be withheld; but they were required to carry into effect a measure of relief, the necessity of which has been admitted, and sanctioned by act of parliament. The hon. member for Sussex had said, that those who advised this measure had not looked into the case of the sufferers, and asserted that the act gave relief in every case where the Land-tax exceeded 4<i>s</i>. in the pound; but the fact was, that in many cases the tax did not amount even to half of that sum,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0061"/>
<col>107</col>
and those persons were therefore placed out of the operation of the relief intended by the legislature; for their condition rendered it impossible that they could make a demand under the provisions of the act. The bill passed in 1794 was in fact, no relief at all; and some other measure ought to be adopted. It might be proposed to throw an additional burthen on the Protestant landholder in the same hundred; but this was equally unjust. He could see no remedy but that of making the loss fall on the public at large. Independent of the injustice of throwing it on the Protestants, there were many instances in which the Land-tax had been redeemed by the greater number of landed proprietors in certain districts; and if such a mode of relief were resorted to, the burthen might fall on one individual. He could see no remedy but by a sacrifice of the public income; and, considering the injustice of the tax, he was sure that every member would submit to such a step.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00176"><member>Mr. G. Dawson</member><membercontribution> said, that although he opposed what was called Catholic emancipation, yet none of the reasons which influenced him upon that question, had any bearing upon the present. As the justice of the proposed measure appeared to be generally admitted, it would not be necessary for him to say any thing about it; although he thought that the injustice of the present system had been overrated. That injustice could operate only in a few instances. He believed that, by appealing to the commissioners, relief might be obtained; but only by throwing the surcharge upon the Protestants. This operation was doubtless very complicated, from the many statutes upon the subject, and from the Land-tax, in the time of Mr. Pitt, having been made redeemable. The principal sufferer was, undoubtedly, sir R. Beddingfield. On his estate there was a parish where the act might be brought into operation; but, unfortunately, he was the owner of the whole parish, and all the inhabitants were Roman Catholics; so that there could be no apportionment through which relief might reach them. He could see no remedy for the grievance, but an act which would at once relieve the Catholics, burthening the Protestants of the same district. The loss to the revenue, he trusted, would be trifling; but it would be only an act of justice.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BOARD OF WORKS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00178"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, he had a motion to submit to the House, through which he hoped to be able to throw some light upon the conduct of the Board of Works. When the office of surveyor-general was first instituted, it was held by sir W. Chambers, but the surveyor-general not being in these times a professional man, he could not exercise that control over the expenditure of his office, which it was the intention of parliament to ensure. Very large sums were lavished upon works the most tasteless and the most inconveniently contrived, that it was possible to imagine, while there seemed to be no other control over the actions of the architect than his own whim or caprice. There were, in fact, three architects whose power in their respective governments was as absolute as that of any Roman praetor in his province. So jealous were these gentlemen of their authority, that for one architect to pass the brook or rivulet which separated his province from that of another, was an infringement upon the rights and an insult to the dignity, of his brother architect, whose province he thus invaded. The government, therefore, instead of having, as was intended, three architects, of whose united abilities they could avail themselves, were limited to one, who never consulted his supposed coadjutors, and who was perfectly absolute in his own district. The consequence was, that gentlemen saw many fine and expensive buildings, but not one, either well adapted to the purpose for which it was intended, or calculated to reflect credit upon the national taste. In order, if possible, to ascertain the reason of this failure, he begged leave to move for "an account of the Salary and Commission granted to each of the three Architects attached to the Office of Works, under Statute of 54 Geo. 3, c. 157, and of the amount of the same, since the appointment of each of them; and also, of any payments or allowances made to each of them during that period, in respect of any of the Royal Palaces, or other public Buildings."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00179"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that the late chancellor of the Exchequer, lord Goderich, had rendered himself responsible for the good taste of all public buildings in future. On him the blame ought to fall, and not upon the surveyor-general, or the architects.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00180"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> did not intend to cast the slightest blame upon the surveyor-general, who was a highly honourable man. The truth
<image src="S2V0018P0I0062"/>
<col>109</col>
was, that not being a professional man, he knew nothing of the business of the office, and left the whole to the architects. As to the pledge of the chancellor of the Exchequer upon the subject of taste, all he knew was, that it had not been redeemed, and he did not think it was a matter of which any chancellor of the Exchequer ought to take cognizance.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ROMAN CATHOLIC CLAIMS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00182"><member>Mr. A. Dawson</member><membercontribution> said, he rose to present several petitions in favour of Catholic Emancipation, to which he wished to draw the particular attention of the House. The petitioners complained that they were, in violation of the Treaty of Limerick loaded with civil disabilities; and they contended for the right to follow the dictates of their consciences, in matters of a religious nature, without thereby incurring any disqualification whatever. In reference to this subject, he begged leave to state, that he, in common with many others, felt considerable surprise and disappointment, in consequence of no notice having been taken in his majesty's Speech of the situation of Ireland, or of those feelings on religious subjects, which not only agitated that country, but had obtained ground in England. It was said by the noble lord opposite, that the omission was of no consequence, as nothing had occurred in Ireland since the last session that called for any mention of that country. But he would state that this was not the fact; for matters of the deepest importance to the welfare and happiness of Ireland had occurred since that period. What could be a more important feature in the history of Ireland than that with one accord, and from one extremity of the island to another, millions of people had assembled on the same day, and at the same hour, for the purpose of respectfully petitioning the legislature for justice? This, it must be admitted, was a most important event: it showed the fixed determination of one portion of our empire to press their claims on the attention of the legislature. If this were a time of war&#x2014;if this country were threatened with invasion&#x2014;would not the legislation attend to this call? And, would they now slumber on their posts? Would they now allow ministers to satisfy
<col>110</col>
them, by saying that there was no necessity to take notice of the situation of Ireland? Four millions of people had attended those simultaneous meetings, of whom not less than one million were capable of bearing arms. They might make a field-marshal premier&#x2014;every member of the cabinet might be a field-marshal&#x2014;but, in his view of the state of the country, it would give the legislature more dignity in the eyes of foreign nations, if they gave peace and tranquillity to Ireland. The Protestant Dissenters of England were united as one man, in calling for relief from civil disabilities; and both the Protestant and the Catholic Dissenters bottomed their request for relief on the same ground; namely, that every man had a right to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience, and to exercise his judgment freely in matters of religion.&#x2014; The hon. gentleman concluded, by presenting sundry petitions from Louth, in favour of Catholic emancipation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00183"><member>Mr. G. Lamb</member><membercontribution> presented a petition of the same nature from the Roman Catholics of Dungarvon. When he last presented a petition on this subject from his constituents, he had expressed a hope that that would be the last time that they would find it necessary to come forward with a similar petition. But he could not now cherish any such expectations; seeing that, since that time, an event had occurred which presented a bulwark against the claims of the Roman Catholics; namely, the appointment of a prime minister who was decidedly hostile to their demands. It was, however, gratifying to him to observe, that the Catholics had never removed their eyes from the great object which they had held so long in view: it was pleasing to contemplate the fact, that they had not slackened their zeal in endeavouring to attain their just rights; and he hoped they would continue to pursue the same course, until they secured those rights which belonged to them, as citizens and subjects of a free state.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00184"><member>Mr. H. V. Stuart</member><membercontribution> presented a similar petition from the Roman Catholics of Newton Barry. He said, that his constituents, and the Catholics at large, deeply deplored the change that had taken place in his; majesty's councils. He begged leave in at few words to explain what his feelings were with respect to the present ministry. Some there were who thought a ministry ought to be supported, if they enabled the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0063"/>
<col>111</col>
country to pursue a successful commercial career; some would give their support to an able financial ministry; and others would found their adherence to the ministry on the ground of the ability which they displayed on subjects connected with our foreign policy. Now, though these were important considerations, yet they yielded in his estimation, before the consideration of the conduct which any government intended to pursue on the subject of the emancipation of the Roman Catholics. He hoped ever to steer his political course by that question alone. On the way in which it was treated would he form his opinion as to the character of the ministers of the Crown. Were they the best financiers, the most able diplomatists, the most profound masters of political economy; were they perfect in every other science that should distinguish ministers; still, if they were opposed to the cause of the Roman Catholics, he should disgrace himself, and belie his long-formed opinions, if he did not say that such men, the friends of exclusion and the enemies of civil and religious liberty, were not fit to govern a free country. It had been his fortune to change seats in that House on two occasions; but though he had changed seats, he had not changed sides or opinions. The government of the earl of Liverpool opposed the claims of the Catholics, and he therefore lifted up his voice against it. The government of Mr. Canning was decidedly in favour of that measure, and therefore he thought it to be his duty to support that government. Those two governments had passed away, and another had succeeded. The new government he must judge of by the same test; and having done so, he felt himself called on to oppose it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00185"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> wished, when any gentleman representing a borough or a county in Ireland rose to present a petition on this subject, that he would enable him to collect, if possible, what he had never yet been able to do with reference to the Catholic question. After describing, with an eloquence peculiarly their own, the distressed situation of their country, those gentlemen always came to this conclusion, that there was no other mode of shedding light on that benighted country, that there was no other way of restoring tranquillity to seven or eight millions of people, except by granting Catholic emancipation. If it were proved that such was really the
<col>112</col>
state of the case, he would abandon any particular feelings which he himself entertained on the subject, and concede the measure. But the statements to which he had alluded were, he believed, not only groundless, but pregnant with mischief. It was desirable that the state of Ireland should be changed from one of wretchedness and horror to one of tranquillity and happiness: but to say that the concession of Catholic emancipation was the only means by which that object could be effected, was to practise a delusion on the people whom those gentlemen wished to serve. The hon. member who spoke last said, he disdained every qualification in a ministry, unless that ministry were friendly to the Catholic claims; he would not support the present administration in making any financial reductions, because they were hostile to those claims. Now, if he were called on to give his support to an administration, that support should be most readily given to men who evinced a desire to look with a steady, undeviating eye to the expenditure of the country, for the purpose of relieving it from the burthens under which it at present groaned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00186"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> said, he had heretofore cautiously abstained from any discussion on this question, and he should not have been induced to take a part in it now, if it had not been for the extravagant misrepresentation of argument and of reasoning, in the speech of the hon. gentleman who had just sat down. If the Irish members could at all participate in the opinions of that hon. gentleman, they would forfeit all claim to the respect of that House. He would not, however, adopt the hon. member's representation of his (Mr. Rice's) feelings and his arguments; and he was sure there was not one of the representatives of Ireland who would not disclaim that representation, if it were necessary. The members for Ireland could speak for themselves; and if they wanted a mouth-piece, they certainly would not select the hon. member for Colchester. There was one point on which he wished to touch, which was not important as proceeding from the hon. member, but which did derive importance from its having been adopted by other individuals. The hon. member said, that if it could be proved to him, that the physical evils which afflicted the people of Ireland would be removed by granting Catholic emancipation, he would be willing to join with the friends of that question,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0064"/>
<col>113</col>
and assist in procuring it. Now, he was ready to join any hon. gentleman, at any time, on that particular issue. He would rest the whole of the argument on that very point. He was prepared to prove, by argument and evidence, that the miseries of that unfortunate country arose out of the abuses of the law, occasioned, not only primarily but exclusively, by this peculiar cause. His hon. friend opposite (Mr. G. Dawson) might differ from him on the point of granting the claims of the Catholics, but he would agree with him that there was no one question of greater importance. His hon. friend might advocate positive resistance to those claims, but still they both agreed, that the question was one of the utmost importance. Neither was the subject unconnected with financial economy in Ireland. By doing justice in that country&#x2014;by reducing the establishment&#x2014;by altering the tithe-system&#x2014;they would produce retrenchment. That would be a large, a wise, a liberal, economy, although the honourable member for Colchester might take a different view of the question. The hon. member for Colchester said, he would come down early and late to support a system of economy. The hon. member would, perhaps, vote for some miserable reduction, by which the country would not be benefitted. Principles, such as the hon. member had thrown out, rendered it necessary, in 1798, to keep up an establishment of a hundred thousand men &#x2014;a larger army than the duke of Wellington commanded on the continent of Europe&#x2014;and to raise by loan (the interest of which they were now obliged to pay) the sum of ten millions, over and above the ordinary supplies. If a different policy had been pursued, this army of a hundred thousand might have been spared&#x2014;this loan of ten millions would have been rendered unnecessary. Such was his idea of economy, in contradistinction to that of the hon. member&#x2014;an economy connected with higher feelings, and better views, than the narrow economy of that hon. gentleman. He called on the House to go on in the work of justice with respect to the Roman Catholics; and he trusted, when their case came to be argued, that the legislature would take the representatives of Ireland as witnesses or advocates, rather than the hon. member for Colchester.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ROMAN CATHOLIC CLAIMS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00188"><member>Major-general</member><membercontribution> King, in rising to present a petition from the Roman Catholics of a parish in the county of Sligo, said:&#x2014;Although I differ totally from the petitioners as to their prayer, which is for the removal of; the civil disabilities imposed on them, I feel it to be my duty to state that the petition is properly worded and respectably signed. In moving that it be brought up, as I am one of those members who have been denounced by an illegal association, acting in the name of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, as an enemy to my country, because we give our support to the present government, I am desirous most clearly to state, that I will never be intimidated by any menace from any body of men belonging to any party, from following the line of duty my conscience may point out to me. In the present head of the government I place the utmost confidence. I am convinced the noble duke will be as tenacious of the rights and liberties of his country in the cabinet, as he was of its safety and honour in the field. I feel a degree of pride in recollecting that I was a witness of his exertions in that theatre of glory. It is with gratification I refer to the brilliant period when I was serving under him, and saw with admiration, the zeal and ability which he displayed. I feel convinced that, in the situation in which he is now placed, he will show an equal degree of attention to all the duties which, in peace and tranquillity, are required from him, as the first minister of the country, as he did in carrying into effect the energetic measures by which he insured its safety and independence. I cannot accede to the opinion I have heard stated in this House, that, the distress which exists in Ireland ought to be attributed to the exclusion of the Catholics from political power. I think that to very different causes it should be assigned. It is absurd to suppose that the violation of the Treaty of Limerick, admitting all that the petitioners say on this head to be correct, could have any effect, at the end of a hundred and forty years, in producing the aggravated distresses which afflict that country. Nor do I believe that the admission of the Catholics to political power would have the least tendency to ameliorate the condition of the Irish, or ad-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0065"/>
<col>115</col>
vance their civilization. I by no means deny the natural powers of that country, if they were rightly directed: but I must give my decided negative to the assertions that are continually made as to the increase of population at the astounding rate at which it is estimated by some gentlemen. We hear of millions added, almost every session, to that population. We have heard, that the places of worship are not sufficient to contain the Catholics of Ireland; but last night we were told, that no less than four millions assembled simultaneously in those places of worship, to prepare petitions to the legislature. If, then, there be accommodation to that extent, can there be any foundation for the complaint, that the Catholics are in want of chapels wherein to perform their religious duties? I have also heard a statement still more extraordinary, and which seemed to me only calculated, to influence the votes of members through fear; namely, that one million out of the four are capable of bearing arms. I leave that question to be decided by others; but why, I ask, was the allusion made? Was it not to gain by intimidation and menace, what there was no chance of obtaining by fair argument? I am as much disposed as any man to acknowledge the right of every person to judge for himself in matters of religion. I am as earnestly as any man the advocate of civil and religious liberty. Man has a right to judge for himself, but no man has a right to dictate to others. That is my creed. What I ask for myself, I am ready to concede to others. I am surprised, I confess, at the arrogant manner in which some honourable gentlemen deny to those who differ from them on this question, almost the right of expressing their opinions. I see them rise "Fire in their eyes, and papers in their hands," and denounce all who dare to question their authority. As to the menaces that are thrown out against those who are opposed to the Catholic claims, I am not one who can be induced to give my vote contrary to my conscience, from any interested views. I will adhere to the course I have pursued for upwards of half a century. I will support the Protestant constitution which has been the preservative of our liberties and rights. Every artifice is used to influence the votes of members. I have heard insinuations, that unless I became a convert to the Catholic question, I should never again sit for the county I
<col>116</col>
have the honour to represent. But I will not sacrifice one item of my principles. If not only the representation but the fee-simple of the whole county depended on my vote, I would not desert my principles. Whatever may befal me, at least, I will not deprive myself of the consolation of having, under all circumstances, done what I conceived to be my duty to my king, and my country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00189"><member>Sir John Brydges</member><membercontribution> said, he was desirous of taking that opportunity of making a few observations. He would, in the first place, state, that he was as much opposed to the measure of Catholic emancipation, as ever. Nay, his opposition was strengthened by all that he had lately witnessed. He alluded particularly to the declaration of the Catholic Association, that every member of parliament Should be considered an enemy to Ireland who supported the present administration. He agreed with the hon. member for Colchester, that emancipation, as it was called, would not tend to the establishment of tranquillity in Ireland. Let the population have employment, and that would have a tendency to fill their pockets and make them satisfied. He was at a loss to divine why all these petitions were presented at this time. He could only account for it by supposing, either that since last session some new circumstances of importance had occurred in Ireland, or that those who advocated the cause of the Catholics derived their principles from the position of the seats they possessed. Last year, after they had obtained office, they made no effort for the Catholics. Now they were out of office, they were beyond measure anxious for the immediate success of the measure. With regard to the present administration, he was glad that the duke of Wellington was at the head of it, and he would give it his utmost support, thoroughly believing that it would uphold the best interests of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00190"><member>Mr. Leycester</member><membercontribution> expressed his regret, that the command of the army and the situation of First Lord of the Treasury should be united in the same individual. He could not very well imagine how the duke of Wellington could wean himself from his long-acquired military habits and avocations. He did not think that a military life was the best school for rearing up a constitutional minister. What was, or ought to be, the attributes of a constitutional minister? He ought to have a deep
<image src="S2V0018P0I0066"/>
<col>117</col>
knowledge of the art of government; he ought to be able impartially to investigate arguments on questions of state policy; he ought to be always ready to enter into a candid consideration of passing circumstances; and, above all, he ought to feel an anxious desire to promote the liberties of the country. Whether the duke of Wellington possessed these qualities, time would determine. But it was said, that the noble duke was sure to bring decision into the cabinet. Now, he believed that military decision and political decision were two very different things. That the duke of Wellington had displayed military decision could not be doubted, otherwise he could not have covered himself and his country with glory, as he had done. But, where was his political decision? What was his conduct on the corn-bill last year? In the first instance, he supported it; and he afterwards defeated it, by throwing out the principal clause. Let the House look to the treaty of Petersburgh. A more puerile, weak, and indecisive document than the noble duke's protocol never existed. Again, let the House look at the king's Speech. Was that, he asked, a specimen of decision? Some persons thought that that Speech indicated a desire of adhesion to the treaty of July last; but others were of opinion, that it was framed with a cautious design to back out of that treaty. Then the epithet "untoward," which occurred in that Speech, and which had been so much talked of, appeared to him to be extremely equivocal. It "hints a fault, and hesitates dislike." It was any thing but decisive. Not only was that epithet an awkward, but an unjust one. So far from the battle of Navarino being an "untoward" event, he considered it as a most toward event. If pacification should be established, it, would be very much owing to the victory of Navarino. It might be supposed, after what he had said, that, he looked upon the duke of Wellington's military education, and his military life, as not fitting him for the situation of prime minister. But he had another powerful objection. The noble duke was an anti-Catholic, and would use his influence to prevent Catholic emancipation. By so doing, he would prevent capital from flowing into Ireland &#x2014;by so doing, he would prevent the employment of its active and industrious population&#x2014;by so doing, he would deprive them of the food which they were
<col>118</col>
anxious to earn by the sweat of their brow. By thus preventing the exertions of industry, he would bring down on this country the dreadful visitation of Irish poverty. Every steam-boat brought over ragged regiments of starving Irishmen. Paupers innumerable were thrown on the different parishes, ruining the comforts and morals of the population of England. Thus it was, that Ireland was hourly aggravating the burthen of the poor-rates of this country&#x2014;thus it was that she was waging war against England. The rags of Ireland were her resources&#x2014;the poverty of Ireland was her sharp sword&#x2014;:her pauper multitudes formed her avenging army:&#x2014;
<quote>&#x2014;" Nos s&#x00E6;vior armis
" Pauperies urget miseramque ulciscitur." <i>Erin.</i></quote>
Let gentlemen go to the parishes of St. Giles's, St. Mary-la-bonne, and St. George, Hanover-square, and they would find the poor-rates doubled since last year, by the necessity of granting occasional relief to the starving Irish. He wished the people of England to know this. He wished his voice could reach throughout the land, that all might be taught to feel, that unless Catholic emancipation was granted, the population of this country would be ruined, that the poor-rates would be doubled, and that no diminution of taxation could possibly take place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00191"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> said, that as the gallant general had gone through, and commented upon, the whole of the petition, he deemed it necessary to offer a few words. He did not quarrel with the panegyric which the gallant general had pronounced on the duke of Wellington: he himself admired, as much as any man, the great military talents of that distinguished personage. But he would ask, did the duke of Wellington's naval renown entitle him to general confidence as a civil minister? Military and political abilities were distinct things, and were very seldom united. An hon. baronet had asked, whether any thing had occurred since last year to make this show of petitions necessary? The fact was, that they grew out of the circumstance of that House not having done that act of justice, without which they would constantly be receiving petitions from Ireland. And God forbid that it should be otherwise&#x0021; for if the people did not, by petitioning, show that they had confidence in that House, it would be the most fatal day that was ever known for
<image src="S2V0018P0I0067"/>
<col>119</col>
this country. It was said, that the misery of Ireland arose, not from the refusal of Catholic emancipation, but from other causes. He, however, thought it might all be traced to that source&#x2014;the prevailing system of exclusion: and he was perfectly sure, that, until equal rights were extended to all the people of Ireland, tranquillity would not be established in that country, nor could there be safety and security for the British empire. This measure could not immediately remove all those evils which had been the growth of centuries; but he would say, that if they were to be removed, the measure to effect that object must be founded on this basis, or the relief would be inefficient. From day to day, the people of Ireland were making war&#x2014;in the only way in which they could make war&#x2014;on this country, by throwing an immense burthen upon its finances. During a long course of years, he had attentively considered this subject, and he was more and more convinced, that there would be no tranquillity for Ireland, or safety for the British empire, until this act of strict justice was done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00192"><member>Sir T. Lethbridge</member><membercontribution> said, that his gallant friend who had introduced the petition, had stated, in a plain and manly manner, the reason why he dissented from the prayer of it. The House ought to thank him for the course which he had taken, especially as he was one of the persons denounced by a self-elected and unconstitutional body. That body had gone to such a length as had never been pursued by any other set of persons. The Catholic Association had assumed, contrary to law, all the power and authority of a legislative body. It not only commanded the population of every parish in Ireland, but it also commanded the pockets of that population. The Association had long been in the habit of receiving a weekly sum, called "the Rent." For what that money was collected, and who had the authority of disposing of it, did not clearly appear. But the time, he believed, was not far distant, when those sums of money would be appropriated in a way which that House and the country would not readily submit to. Those who supported the claims of the Catholics in that House, if they had any love for consistency, and for the constitution, ought to take their stand now, and declare, that until this illegal body was put down, and prevented from bullying the empire, they would not press the
<col>120</col>
claims of the Catholics. If such a system of intimidation was continued, he feared there would be few members, who, like his gallant friend, would come forward and give an unbiassed vote on this question. The friends of the Catholics ought therefore to tell this unconstitutional body, that they were taking steps destructive to their cause. These frightful denunciations, it should be observed, did not come from a powerless body, but from those who might be said to have the rule of Ireland. They had denounced all those who should support an administration, at the head of which was the duke of Wellington; or any administration formed on similar principles. This was highly unconstitutional, and he trusted that parliament would not legislate on this question, until these denunciations were withdrawn. Having named the duke of Wellington, he thought he could not do better than say, that he entertained the highest confidence that his administration would be fraught with signal advantages to his country. Whatever the tone of his majesty's Speech might have been&#x2014;and he did not approve of the whole of it&#x2014;he felt confident that the honour, dignity, and fair fame of the British character would be better preserved by the policy which the duke of Wellington would pursue, than by that which had been adopted by the late short-lived administration, which had been described by the hon. baronet, the member for Westminster (sir F. Burdett), as having tumbled to pieces in consequence of its own diffidence; but which, he thought, had tumbled to pieces from its own weakness and imbecility. That administration had not lived long enough to do much mischief; but he certainly never recollected one so inefficient and imbecile. The great statesman now no more could not, as I then predicted, with all his foresight and tact, have kept together, for two years, such a mass of heterogeneous materials. If his great talents could not effect that object, where was there any one in the late administration capable of achieving it? The result had proved the truth of the prophecies uttered in that House during the last session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00193"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> observed, that the hon. member for Somersetshire was undoubtedly one of the most downright, straightforward opponents of Catholic emancipation; so much so, that he would consider the hon. baronet as the embodied spirit of the whole
<image src="S2V0018P0I0068"/>
<col>121</col>
of those who were hostile to the Catholic claims, and, thanking him for his candour, he would deal with him and his opinions with the utmost possible respect. He could not, however, carry his notion of respect for him and for the gallant general so far, as to give them credit for being very profound judges of the law; and yet great part of the speeches of the gallant general and of the hon. member had gone to that point&#x2014;that a certain association in Ireland was an illegal association, and that so long as it existed, the House ought to refuse the claims of the Roman Catholics. There were, however, stronger opinions on the case, than either that of the gallant general or of the hon. baronet&#x2014;opinions which had been given within the last two years. The first witness he would call to prove the legality of this Association was the present Secretary of State for the Home Department. He had been in that situation for two years, and during that time, he was in constant connexion with Ireland; and assuredly, if that Association was illegal, it was the duty of that right hon. gentleman to put it down, and to punish the violators of the law. His next witness was the late lord chancellor Manners. Would that learned lord, living in Dublin, and reading the reports of the proceedings of the Association daily&#x2014; would he, if it had been illegal, have sanctioned it by his tacit acquiescence? The argument, then, of the gallant general and of the hon. baronet was not sustained either by law or facts. He must say this, in support of what was called the Protestant government, who had suffered the Association to exist; and he must give his distinct and decided negative to what was advanced on the other side. In what was it illegal? In giving instructions to their representatives? Was that illegal? Was it maintained that the Catholics could not meet to discuss their grievances without a breach of the law? The hon. baronet, when the Corn-laws and agricultural distress were the topics of the day, brought up innumerable petitions, formed committees, and disseminated documents, on that subject. The difference between the two proceedings consisted merely in the nature of the object of each party. The hon. baronet had his committee sitting in Palace-yard; the Roman Catholics had theirs sitting in Dublin. On the one hand there was Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Shiel; on the other, the hon. baronet and Mr.
<col>122</col>
Webb Hall. In point of law, he could not see the difference between the two meetings.&#x2014;He hoped that neither of the hon. members would suppose that he was the advocate of the Association. He deprecated it from the bottom of his heart. It was pregnant with danger; it tended to the separation of the countries; it produced disturbance, and was calculated to do mischief, in every possible way. This was no new language of his. He had held the same language when that absurd act was in progress, which, from the nature of their observations, the gallant general and the hon. baronet seem to wish to have renewed. But, if the government attempted to re-enact it, he believed they would find it difficult to carry their purpose into effect. He wished to put down the Association; he wished to put down agitators; he wished to put down demagogues, whether agricultural in Palace-yard, or Roman Catholic in Dublin. But, could the Association be put down by legal enactments? The experiment was tried, and it had failed. Two of the wisest lawyers had framed an act, which it was hoped would throw a net over the Association, and hold it in its iron grasp for ever. That engine, however, proved useless; and, if another were forged, it would also be broken to shatters. They could not effect their object, unless by the prohibition of reading, writing, meeting, speaking, and thinking. But, if they went ever so far, there would still be that left which their power could not reach&#x2014;they could not prohibit thinking; and if they left the feeling deep and sore; if they left the heart ulcerated; he must be a man of little judgment, he could little know the human mind, he could have reflected or felt little himself, who did not perceive, that such a state of things was full of danger to the state.&#x2014;It had been suggested, that there had been a disinclination on the part of the friends of the Catholic question to press it during the present session. This charge was, as regarded himself and his friends, entirely void of foundation; and they would be unworthy of their seats in that House, if it were not so. He would appeal to the whole House, whether the conduct of the party with which he acted had not been uniformly the same, whether in office or out of it? His feeling upon the petition presented to the House would have been exactly the same, had he sat on the opposite benches when
<image src="S2V0018P0I0069"/>
<col>123</col>
it appeared, as it was at present. The question, indeed, of Catholic emancipation was too large, and too pressing a one, to be made a question of party. God forbid that there should be a man in that House, far less a member connected with Ireland, who could make any question in which the peace of that country was concerned, the means of annoying an administration, or acquiring for himself a transient popularity&#x0021; It had been urged by those who opposed emancipation, that the remedy for the evils of Ireland was employment. But, as long as this grievance remained in issue, employment would produce fresh opposition, and fresh resistance, rather than peace. The Catholics might be silent, who were now oppressed and bound down by poverty; but, the instant they gained ease or riches, they would only swell the cry that clamoured for a restitution of their rights. Reports were abroad, that the present ministers were to be neutral upon the Catholic question&#x2014;that the administration had been formed upon the understanding that they were to be so. The question would shortly come before the House; which would then have an opportunity of judging whether this neutrality was real or affected. For himself, he stood there disposed to serve the country as far as he could. He would support the new administration in any measures which he believed likely to tend to the common advantage; and after this declaration, his voice, perhaps, would have more weight in resisting those of a contrary character, than if it were supposed that he had fixed himself in downright, uncompromising opposition. He was ready to acquiesce in the convenience of making as few observations as possible on the presenting of petitions; but if observations were made on such occasions hostile to the interests of the petitioners, their friends would be negligent of their duty if they were not always prepared to meet them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00194"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> said, he had been hitherto silent on the question of Catholic emancipation, and would not now have addressed the House had not a scene been exhibited, which, though he had not much experience as a member of that House, he believed to be rare in the discussion of any question. The House had heard the gallant officer, in presenting the petition, repel the attacks which he conceived directed against him by the Catholic Asso-

ciation, and then detail his reasons for thinking that the prayer of the petition ought to be rejected. He was not so much surprised at the gallant officer, as at the sentiments expressed by the hon. baronet; who had said, that gentlemen on presenting petitions, on that side of the House, ought to abstain from any observations upon their merits. The hon. baronet's principle would go to the extent, that no gentleman ought to present a petition, unless he was an enemy to the question; for he recommended gentlemen to imitate the example of the gallant officer, which was neither more nor less than telling the House, that the prayer of the petitions which they presented ought not to be granted. For himself, he was as satisfied as he was of his own existence, that there was no other means of restoring tranquillity to Ireland, than by granting the relief sought for. He hoped that measures would soon be taken to tranquillize that country, and that things would not be suffered to go the length of furnishing an additional proof, that nothing would be granted but in times of panic and dismay. He was quite certain, that the prayer of the petition must ultimately be granted; and his wish, hope, and advice, were, that such concessions might be granted while it could be done with honour, and that the government would not wait for the day of terror and humiliation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CORPORATION AND TEST ACTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00196"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> presented a petition from the Roman Catholic inhabitants of Kilmain, praying for Catholic Emancipation. He begged to embrace that opportunity of disclaiming, on the part of the Dissenters of England, any junction with the Roman Catholics of Ireland; and, at the same time, distinctly to disavow any hostility, on their part, to the claims of the latter. An incautious and unauthorized paragraph had found its way into the newspapers, which had created the supposition now contradicted by him. For himself, he had voted in favour of that question on every occasion; and he should continue to do so. But with respect to the Dissenters, their case had been under consideration, and they had been advised by their friends to stand on a different ground from the Catholics. The position in which the two parties were placed was, in fact,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0070"/>
<col>125</col>
the same. The grand argument of both was, that no man's civil and religious liberties ought to be kept separate; yet as, owing to circumstances, the case of the Dissenters was peculiar, it was thought better that they should keep apart from the Catholics. But, whether carried separately or in union, it was his settled opinion, that the success of both was essential to the safety and well-being of the state.</membercontribution></p>

Whether they were right or wrong in so doing, he would not give an opinion; but he was quite sure that the whole kingdom ought to unite hand and heart, in endeavouring to obtain a repeal of the Test and Corporation acts, and of all penal restrictions upon religious liberty. There could be neither tranquillity in Ireland nor safety to England until the point was carried; and he entirely agreed with the hon. member who had said, that the House should grant it while it would be received as a boon, instead of waiting until it should be extorted from them in a moment of danger.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARRESTS FOR DEBT ON MESNE PROCESS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00200"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that he had, last, session, submitted to the House several motions on the subject of the Law of Arrest. In consequence of the magnitude of the evil which arose to individuals by their being deprived of their liberty for debt, he had then submitted two bills, for the purpose of doing away with arrest altogether, and giving to the creditor a claim on the property of the debtor. He had not founded those bills on any vague or theoretical idea, as had been insinuated, but on the custom and practice that had existed for centuries in Scotland and in other countries; where, so far from any danger or inconvenience having arisen from such a course, it had been found to produce a most beneficial effect. The result had proved, that there was much more of debt recovered in Scotland than in England, from those who were insolvent: he believed
<col>126</col>
he might say, that the proportion was as great as ten to one. The creditor there had no power to arrest his debtor, until a verdict had been obtained before a judge, and until the debt had been proved to be due. In England, on the contrary, a person of the worst character was allowed to depose to a debt on oath, against any individual whom he might think proper to select, with the exception of members of parliament and peers. Every man, he thought, must be anxious to put down a species of oppression, which placed a power in hands where it had been so much abused. The practice in England, in many respects, was very contradictory. Men were roused in an instant if a justice of peace, by mistake, or for trespass, imprisoned a man, if it were only for a few hours. The daily press, as it ought to do, instantly raised an outcry against the offender, holding him up to public notice; yet, all this time, thousands were deprived of their liberty, and thrown into prison, without any inquiry. He therefore said, that the whole system of mesne process, as it was called, was most harassing, and that it was a blot on the country. The subject ought to be protected against such a grievous hardship; and as payment could not be obtained by confining the body within the bare walls of a prison, recourse should be had to the effects of the debtor. Acts of the greatest cruelty and injustice were constantly committed in consequence of this law. Thousands of individuals were yearly arrested; some out of spite; others from having had a quarrel with their creditor; and all without the least inquiry, as to the character of the individual upon whose simple oath they were committed, first into the hands of a sheriff's officer, and then to the cells of a prison. In Scotland, such could not take place; and even in some of the English colonies abroad, no such proceeding was recognised. In Canada, a man could not be arrested, unless a magistrate was satisfied on oath that he was about to leave the country, and then he was only called on to give security that he would not leave the country. In France, Spain, Holland, and most of the continental states, the laws were more favourable for the debtor, and generally counteracted the malice or revenge of the creditor. Last session he had proposed a remedy, which was objected to by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, now absent from the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0071"/>
<col>127</col>
House. His object was to lay before the country the evils produced by the present system. The hon. member then proceeded to read, from the returns upon the table of the House, the number of persons then confined in the different prisons, and contended, that it was clear from those returns, that arrests effected any thing but the proposed end; namely, the payment of debts. It was absurd to suppose that confining a man within the walls of a prison was the way to make him pay his debts. On the contrary, it prevented all possibility of his doing so, because it precluded all possibility of his exercising the calling by which he had been accustomed to gain a livelihood. A glaring instance of the folly of this proceeding was the case of Mr. Haydon, the artist, who was prevented by imprisonment from exercising his profession, for whom a subscription was entered into, and who, at a public meeting, had showed how short-sighted were the persons who had placed him in such a situation. He thought the subject, in every point of view, so important, that, should it not be included in the motion which his learned friend, the member for Winchelsea, was to bring forward to-morrow, he would move for a select committee to inquire into it. He would now move, "That there be laid before the House, a Return of the number of Prisoners committed to the King's Bench, Fleet, Whitecross-street, Marshalsea, and Horsemonger-lane Prisons, in 1827; distinguishing those in custody under Mesne Process, or under Judgments Recovered, or for Costs of Suits; stating how many for sums above 100<i>l</i>., between 50<i>l</i>. and 100<i>l</i>., between 50<i>l</i>. and 20<i>l</i>., and sums under 20<i>l</i>. (excluding Crown Debtors); stating also the number in custody in each of those Prisons on 1st January, 1828." Also, "A Return of the number of Warrants granted to arrest for Debt by the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, and by the Sheriff of Surrey, and the number of Bailable Processes executed by them in the year 1827."&#x2014;Ordered.</membercontribution></p>

<title>STATE OF THE COURTS OF COMMON LAW.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00201"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> rose, and addressed the House as follows: <sup>*</sup>&#x2014;
<quote><sup>*</sup> Inserted, by Mr. Brougham's permission, from the original edition, printed for H. Colburn.</quote>
<col>128</col>
In rising to address the House upon one of the most important subjects that can possibly be submitted to the legislature, I feel at the same time deeply impressed with the conviction, that it is also one of the most difficult, and certainly the largest, that could engage its attention. I am aware that I stand engaged to bring before you the whole state of the Common Law of this country; the Common Law I call it (in contradistinction to Equity), with the view of pointing out those defects which may have existed in its original construction, or which time may have engendered, as well as of considering the remedies appropriate to correct them. Nothing, I do assure you, at all strengthens and bears me up under the pressure of this vast and overwhelming burthen, but a conviction of the paramount importance, nay, the absolute necessity, of no longer delaying the inquiry, or postponing the needful amendments; and the intimate persuasion I feel, that I shall be able so to deal with the subject (such is my veneration for all that is good in our judicial system, and my habitual respect for those in whose hands the administration of it is placed), as neither to offend the prejudices of one class, nor vex the personal feelings of another. But I feel a confidence, also, which is unspeakable, resting on another ground. I come not here to raise cavils before men, ignorant of the details and niceties of the profession I belong to, and who, in that unavoidable ignorance, would be unfit judges of their merits; I am determined to avail myself in no respect of their situation, or of the absence of the learned body of the profession, for the sake of a futile and pitiful triumph over what is most valuable in our jurisprudence. I am comforted and confirmed in my resolution, from the accidental circumstances that have joined me, in some sort, to the administration of the law, in which I have had so considerable an experience, I have seen so much of its practical details, that it is, in my view, no speculative matter whether for blame or praise. I pledge myself, through the whole course of my statement, as long as the House may honour me with its attention, in no one instance to make any observation, to bring forward any grievance, or mark any defect, of which I am not myself competent to speak from personal knowledge. I do not merely say, from observation as a bystander; I limit myself still further, and confine myself to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0072"/>
<col>129</col>
causes in which I have been counsel for one party or the other. By these considerations, emboldened on the one hand, and, on the other impressed with a becoming sense of the arduous duty I have undertaken in this weighty matter, I will, without further preface, go on, in the first place, to state the points which I intend to avoid.<lb/>
I shall omit Equity, in every branch, unless where I may be compelled to mention it incidentally, from its interference with the course of the Common Law; not that I think nothing should be done as to Equity, but because in some sort it has been already taken up by parliament. A commission has sat, and inquired into the subject, and produced a Report, received, though not yet acted upon. The noble and learned lord, who presides in the other House, has announced his intention of preparing a bill, founded on that Report. I may also add, that the subject has, to his own great honour, and to the lasting benefit of the country, been for many years in the hands of my hon. and learned friend, the member for Durham (Mr. M. A. Taylor): it is still with him, and I trust his care of it will not cease. For reasons of a like kind, I pass over the great head of Criminal Law. That inquiry, happily for the country, since the time when first sir Samuel Romilly (a name never to be pronounced by any without veneration, nor ever by me without sorrow) devoted his talents and experience to it, has been carried forward by my hon. and learned friend, the member for Knaresborough (sir James Mackintosh) with various success, until at length he reaped the fruit of his labours, and prevailed upon this House, by a narrow majority, to lend its attention towards so great a subject. On a smaller scale, on one indeed of a very limited nature, these inquiries have been followed up by the right hon. gentleman, who is now again Secretary of State for the Home Department. It is not so much for any thing he has actually done, that I feel disposed to thank him, as for the countenance he has given to the subject. He has power, from his situation, to effect reforms, which others hardly dare propose. His connections in the Church and State, render his services in this department almost invaluable. They have tended to silence the clamours that would otherwise have been raised against the reform of the law, and might possibly have proved fatal
<col>130</col>
to it. If (which I do not believe) he intended to limit his efforts to what he has already accomplished; if he were disposed to say, "Thus far have I gone, and no further can I go with you," the gratitude of his country would still be due to him in an eminent degree, for having abashed the worst enemies of improvement, by his countenance and support. But I trust he will gain direct the energies of his mind to the great work of reformation, and bestow his exertions over a wider space<lb/>
Another reason for avoiding this part of the subject altogether is to be found in the nature and objects of the Criminal Law. I do not think it right to unsettle the minds of those numerous and ignorant classes, on whom its sanctions are principally intended to operate. It might produce no good effects if they were all at once to learn, that the Criminal Code in the mass, as it were, had been sentenced to undergo a revision&#x2014;that the whole penal code was unsettled and about to be remodelled.<lb/>
I intend also to leave out of my view the Commercial Law. It lies within a narrow compass, and it is far purer and freer from defects than any other part of the system. This arises from its late origin. It has grown up within two centuries, or a little more, and been formed by degrees as the exigency of mercantile affairs required. It is accepted, too, in many of its main branches, by other states, forming a code common to all trading nations, and which cannot easily be changed without their general consent. Accordingly, the provisions of the French Civil code, unsparing as they were of the old Municipal-law, excepted the law merchant, generally speaking, from the changes which they introduced.<lb/>
Lastly, Sir, the law of Real Property forms no immediate subject of my present consideration: not that I shall not have much to propose intimately connected with it, and many illustrations to derive from it; but I am flattered with the hope, that the Secretary for the Home Department intends himself, on this subject, to bring forward certain measures, by which the present system will eventually undergo salutary alterations; and I cannot help here saying, that whatever the Criminal Law owes to the persevering and enlightened exertions of the late sir Samuel Romilly, and of his successor, the member for Knaresborough (sir James Mackintosh), I am
<image src="S2V0018P0I0073"/>
<col>131</col>
sure an almost equal debt of gratitude has been incurred on the part of the law of Real Property, to the honest, patient, and luminous discussion which it has received from one of the first conveyancers and lawyers this country could ever boast of. My hon. and learned friend (the Solicitor General) opposite, and those members of the House who are conversant with our profession, will easily understand, that I can only allude to Mr. Humphreys.<lb/>
With these exceptions, which I have now stated as shortly as I was able, and for which I shall offer no apology, because it was absolutely necessary that I should begin by making the scope of my present purpose understood, I intend to bring all the law as administered in our courts of justice, under the review of the House; and, to this ample task, I at once proceed. But I shall not enlarge, after the manner of some, on the infinite importance and high interest which belong to the question, and the attention which it, of right, claims from us, whether considered as a branch of the government, or as the representatives of the people, or as a part of the people themselves. It would be wholly superfluous,&#x2014;for every one must at once admit, that, if we view the whole establishments of the country, the government by the king, and the estates of the realm,&#x2014;the entire system of administration, whether civil or military&#x2014;the vast establish merits of land and of naval force by which the state is defended&#x2014;our foreign negotiations, intended to preserve peace with the world&#x2014;our domestic arrangements, necessary to make the government respected by the people&#x2014;or our fiscal regulations, by which the expense of the whole is to be supported&#x2014;all shrink into nothing, when compared with the pure, and prompt, and cheap administration off justice throughout the empire. I will indeed make no such comparison; I will not put in contrast things so inseparably connected; for all the establishments formed by our ancestors, and supported by their descendants, were invented and are chiefly maintained, in order that justice may be duly administered between man and man. And, in my mind, he was guilty of no error&#x2014;he was chargeable with no exaggeration&#x2014;he was betrayed by his faney into no metaphor, who once said, that all we see about us, King, Lords, and Commons, the whole machinery of the State, all the apparatus of the system, and its varied workings; ended in
<col>132</col>
simply bringing twelve good men into a box. Such&#x2014;the administration of justice&#x2014;is the cause of the establishment of government&#x2014;such is the use of government: it is this purpose which can alone justify restraints on natural liberty&#x2014;it is this only which can excuse constant interference with the rights and property of men. I then invite you, Sir, to enter upon an unsparing examination of this mighty subject: I invite the House to proceed with me, first of all into the different Courts&#x2014;to mark what failures in practice are to be found in the system, as it was originally framed, as well as what errors time has engendered by occasioning a departure from that system; and then to consider, whether we may not, safely, and usefully, apply to these defects remedies of a seasonable and temperate nature, restoring what is decayed, if it be good&#x2014;lopping off what experience has proved to be pernicious.<lb/>
i.&#x2014;In the first place, let us proceed to the Courts in Westminster-hall, and observe the course pursued in them. The House is aware that, whatever may have been the original of our three great Common Law courts, they now deal with nearly the same description of suits, and that, though the jurisdiction of each was at first separate, and confined within very narrow limits, their functions are now nearly the same. The jurisdiction of the court of King's-bench, for example, was originally confined to pleas of the Crown, and then extended to actions where violence was used&#x2014;actions of trespass, by force; but, now, all actions are admissible within its walkthrough the medium of a legal fiction, which was adopted for the purpose of enlarging its authority, that every person sued is in the custody of the marshal of the court, and may, therefore, be proceeded against for any personal cause of action. Thus, by degrees, this court has drawn over to itself actions which really belong to the great forum of ordinary actions between subject and subject, as its name implies, the court of Common Pleas. The court of Common Pleas, however, in its exertions for extending its business, was not so fortunate as its rival; for, though it made a vigorous attempt under lord chief justice North with that view, it never was able to obtain cognizance of&#x2014;the peculiar subject of King's-bench jurisdiction&#x2014;Crown Pleas.<lb/>
I hope, Sir, the House will allow me, for the sake of a little divertissement in the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0074"/>
<col>133</col>
midst of so dry a matter, to state the nature of the contest between the two courts, as described by Roger North in his biography of Lord Keeper Guildford; a work of amusement, with which I am sure my learned friend (the Solicitor-general) is as well acquainted as he is with the subtleties of his profession.<lb/>
It appears from his account, that the courts of King's-bench and of Common Pleas had quarrelled as to their respective provinces; for he says, "The court of Common Pleas had been outwitted by the King's-bench, till his lordship came upon the cushion, and that by our artifice in process called <i>ac etiams</i>. His lordship used the same artifice in the process of his court, where it was as good law as above. But Hale exclaimed against it, and called it altering the process of law; which very same thing his own court had done and continued to do every day."<sup>*</sup> In another place he tells, "The courts being upon terms of competition, the King's-bench outwitted in the Common Pleas:" and how the latter invented a shift against the King's-bench, "There," says he, "the Common Pleas thought they had nicked them. But the King's-bench was not so sterile of invention as to want the means of being even with that device," and he shews how&#x2014;concluding with this remark&#x2014;"The late chief justice, sir Orlando Bridgman, and his officers of the Common Pleas, gave this way of proceeding to the King's bench very ill language, calling it an arbitrary alteration of the form of legal process, and utterly against law. But the losers might speak; they got nothing else; and the <i>Triccum in lege</i>, carried it for the King's-bench; which court, as I said, ran away with all the business."&#x2020;<lb/>
The Exchequer has adopted a similar course; for, though it was originally confined to the trial of revenue cases, it has, by means of another fiction&#x2014;the supposition, that every body sued as a debtor to the Crown, and further, that he cannot pay his debt, because the other party will not pay him,&#x2014;opened its doors to every suitor, and so drawn to itself the right of trying cases, that were never intended to be placed within its jurisdiction.<lb/>
The first state of the courts being that of distinct jurisdiction, then, of course, this

<quote>&#x2020; Ibid.</quote>
<col>134</col>
separation of provinces was praised, therefore all distinction became obsolete, and then the conflict and competition were as much commended; and with far greater reason, if it were real; but it is almost purely speculative. In the first place, the court of Common Pleas shuts its doors to many practitioners of the law, requiring that a certain proportion of fees should be advanced at a much earlier stage in the cause, than is customary in the other courts. And who is it that must advance this money? Either the attorney himself, if it be his own cause, must pay the money out of his own pocket, or, if he is acting as agent for a country practitioner, he must begin by laying out the money long before he can draw upon his employer for reimbursement; and he is not, in all cases, sure of being repaid for these advances. In the second place, clients and their attornies are induced, not to carry causes into the Common Pleas, by the strict monopoly that exists in the advocates of that court. I have every wish to speak with all respect of the learned persons who there engross the practice; but as, no doubt solicitors will have their favourites, and as possibly their clients may also have their favourites, the practice not being open to all barristers, prevents many suitors from resorting to a court where no one can be employed for them, at least in term time, except he be a sergeant; and, great as the learning of that body is known to be, well founded as their reputation is, for skill and for zeal, as well as for legal knowledge, yet the exclusive right which they exercise operates to keep away business from the court, and thus it has happened, both that other advocates seldom practise there at Nisi Prius where the court is open, and that much fewer suits are carried to the Common. Pleas than to the King's-bench. The causes which thus operate to shut the doors of that court must be removed before it can hope to have its fair share of practice. The Exchequer, in like manner, has its drawbacks, though they operate in another way. There is one reason why, as at present constituted, it cannot do much business, or have the high reputation which it ought to enjoy; I mean the mixture of various suits which are cognizable in it. It is, in fact, a court of all sorts&#x2014;of equity and of law&#x2014;of revenue law, and of ordinary law&#x2014;of law between subject and subject, as well as of law between the subject and the Crown. This makes suitors, seeing the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0075"/>
<col>135</col>
business done in so many different ways, come to the conclusion that it is not well done in any: I do not by any means assert, that this is a correct opinion, at the present time; because the judges and the barristers employed in that court, do not, I am convinced, yield to any body of professional men in their knowledge of equity and law. There are to be found on its bench, highly distinguished equity, and common lawyers; men of known legal talents, and the greatest experience, both in Chancery practice, in Nisi Prius, and in Criminal law. In what, therefore, I have said, I refer merely to that species of public opinion, which, whether right or wrong, has been engendered by the constitution of the court; I refer, also, to the natural tendency of a jurisdiction, thus open to such a variety of jurisprudence, to degenerate into inaccuracy, or want of effective skill in each department.<lb/>
But there is another and more obvious reason why this court does not obtain so much business as the others; I mean the limited number of attornies belonging to and allowed to practise in it. If there is cause to complain, as I have been doing, of the monopoly among the advocates attached to the Common Pleas, there is much more cause for a similar complaint touching the attornies in the Exchequer. The practitioners in that court are four attornies and sixteen clerks, and none others are allowed to practise there: if a country attorney wishes to take his cause thither, the only mode by which he can do so, is to employ one of the privileged attornies of the court, and divide with him the profits of the suit. It is needless to say, that such a system has, of necessity, a tendency at once to shut the doors of the court of Exchequer against suitors.<lb/>
What, then, is the natural consequence of those restrictions which prevent suitors from approaching the courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer? Why, it is this&#x2014;wherever there is but little business done in any court, those in power are induced not to place the strongest judge in that situation; then, the small portion of business to be done, renders the judge less fit for his office, and so, by action and reaction, while the little business makes the bench and the bar less able, the inferior ability of the court still further reduces that little business. I am here speaking of past times, but with a view, however, to what may occur at a future period. We
<col>136</col>
may not always have the bench so well filled as it is at present. The time may come when, if a judge were to be made, in consequence of political influence, who was known not to be capable of properly filling the office, it may be said by those who supported him, "Oh, it does not matter&#x2014;send him to the court of Exchequer&#x2014;there is nothing to do there." Thus, the small portion of business transacted&#x2014;the suspicion originating in the general mixture of suits, carried on in different ways, that the business is not well done,&#x2014;the monopoly of attornies, together with several other causes, occasions this court to be the least frequented of any: indeed, it has now scarcely any thing to engage its attention. The judges do not sit for more than half an hour some mornings, and there are hardly ever on the paper more than six or seven causes for trial after term: a dozen would be considered a large entry; when I well remember lord Ellenborough having five hundred and eighty-eight set down for trial in London only; and the present lord chief justice lately had on his paper no less than eight hundred and fifty untried causes. I mention this to support my proposition, that there is not really a free competition between the different courts. To say, in the circumstances which I have stated, that suitors have a free access to all the courts equally, is a fiction&#x2014;an assertion adapted to what ought to be, perhaps to what is intended, but not founded on the fact.<lb/>
Experiments have been tried to lighten the business of the court of King's-bench; but I do not find that any of them have answered the purpose for which they were instituted. The first of these attempts was made in the year 1821, when it was arranged, that the chief justice should sit in one court, and a puisne judge in another, at the same time; but never did any arrangement fail more completely. The court in which the puisne judge sat remained almost idle; while the other court was as constantly preferred, and nearly as much overloaded as before. Little else was effected but a great inconvenience both to practitioners and suitors, by the passing and repassing from court to court. In fact, it is not in the power of the courts, even were all monopolies and other restrictions done away, to distribute business equally, as long as the suitors are left free to choose their tribunal. There will always be a favourite court; and the cir-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0076"/>
<col>137</col>
cumstance of its being preferred tends to make it more deserving of preference; for if the favour towards it began in mere caprice, the great amount of business draws thither the best practitioners, to say nothing of judges; and the better the court, the greater will be its business. The same action and re-action will operate favourably, which I before shewed in its unfavourable effects, where a court was declining.&#x2014;"<i>Possunt quia posse videntur."</i> The experiment of 1821, having failed entirely, was not repeated.<lb/>
Another attempt has subsequently been made to relieve the court of King's-bench from the pressure of Term business, which must always bear a proportion to the Nisi Prius causes. This system is still going on, under the bill brought into the House by the present Chancellor, and of which, though he was induced to patronize it officially when Solicitor-general, I have reason to believe he never much approved. As this arrangement is compulsory, the client having no choice, it cannot well fail; but I heartily wish that it had failed, for it has done much mischief, and is certainly one of the worst changes that has ever taken place. It is true, the great pressure of business requires that something should be done; but it is equally true, that the right thing has not been adopted; for, where the King's-bench sits, with the chief justice presiding&#x2014;where the suitors resort&#x2014;where the bar is mustered&#x2014;where the public attend&#x2014;where all the counsel and attornies appear&#x2014;where the business is disposed of, as it ought to be, gravely and deliberately, with the eyes of mankind, with the eyes of the bar, as well as of the world at large, turned on the proceedings&#x2014;would not every one point to as the place in which all important legal questions ought to be decided? Would not any one, on the other hand, say, if another court were instituted in a sort of back-room, where three judges were sitting&#x2014;where the only persons present, beside the judges, were the counsel and attorney employed on either side of the cause that was pending&#x2014;where there was no audience, and the public eye was entirely directed not <i>upon</i> but <i>from</i> that to the other court&#x2014;would not any one, I ask, declare, that a court so constituted was the place in which the trifling business alone should be transacted: These, I think, would be but natural conclusions; and yet if the matter be stated exactly the
<col>138</col>
other way, it will be far nearer the truth. Of the really important business, as regards both its difficulty and importance to the law, and, indeed, to the suitor, a very large proportion is done in that back-room, and before these three judges; it is done in a corner, and, I may say, disposed of behind people's backs, with only the attendance of the attorney and barrister on each side, or, at most, with the presence of these and of the practitioners waiting for the next cause; and as the court is not frequented by the public any more than the profession, the business may certainly be said to be transacted without due publicity and solemnity. Thus we see, that by this arrangement, while the most interesting matter is overlooked, trifling business and points of no importance are brought forward with all possible observation:&#x2014;a motion for judgment as against the casual ejector, which is a motion of course&#x2014;a motion to refer a bill to the Master to compute principal and interest&#x2014;for judgment, as in case of a nonsuit&#x2014;and a thousand others, either of course or of the most trifling moment, are heard with the utmost publicity, before the whole court&#x2014;before the whole bar&#x2014;before the whole body of attornies&#x2014;before the whole public&#x2014;all of which might be settled by three judges in a corner, or by any one of them, or by any one of their clerks. The consequence is, that much time is lost to the full court, while the most important business&#x2014;special arguments, raising the greatest legal questions&#x2014;new trials, involving both matters of law and facts affecting large interests; and the crown-paper comprehending all the questions from Session, are obliged to be heard in the private and unsatisfactory manner I have described. I wish this system to be remedied, because it is a great and growing evil. It may be said, that the judges have not time to do the business. I deny that: there is time. Six hours a day, well employed, would be amply sufficient for all purposes. Let them come down to the court at ten o'clock in the morning and remain till four&#x2014;a period of six hours&#x2014;and the business may be done. But the system is at present extremely ill-arranged; and I will show how, without having any one to blame for it. The judges do their utmost, but they cannot remedy the evil without your aid. Let us see how their time is employed. They are supposed to come to the court at ten
<image src="S2V0018P0I0077"/>
<col>139</col>
o'clock, and to remain there till four. Surely this time may safely be pronounced to be sufficient for the transaction of their business. Then why have they not these six hours? There are two reasons for this:&#x2014;the one is, that bail must be taken by a judge. Mr. Justice Bayley, no longer ago than last Monday, was occupied the whole day in the Bail court; and this morning Mr. Justice Holroyd was not able to get away till twelve o'clock. I cite these instances of late occurrence, Sir, that you may see how closely I desire to keep by the actually existing state of the facts; but every week furnishes examples as well as the present. Thus, then, we see that in one case a whole day was lost, as far as regards a full court, and in another two hours, merely for the purpose of attending to trifling business, which might just as well be transacted by a commissioner, say a barrister of ten years standing. The other reason why the judges' time is mispent, arises from chamber business, which consists in the learned judges', the profound lawyers, the great magistrates, whose names I have made free to mention, sitting at Sergeants'-inn to hear the squabbles of attornies, and the clerks of attornies, among themselves, for barristers rarely attend: this takes them in rotation away from the court at three o'clock; so that, in fact, while their nominal time is from ten to four, they are only, on the average, really present from eleven or twelve to three, by which, instead of transacting business during six hours, the time is reduced to three, or at most four hours per day. And what, Sir, is the inference from all this? Obvious enough, certainly: for though it may be fairly contended, that the business of the Bail-court could be transacted by a commissioner, it may, perhaps, be doubted whether the Chamber practice does not require a judge to perform it, considering the points to be disposed of, and the persons to be controlled. There may, therefore, be a sufficient excuse for the arrangement, as matters stand at present, and yet a remedy may be necessary, as it may certainly be found in changing the circumstances. For my own part, I frankly confess that I am one of those who do not see the permanent excellence that some suppose to be vested in the number twelve; although lord Coke has spoken of it with a degree of rapture like that of the Algebraist, when he dwells upon the mar-
<col>140</col>
vellous powers of three or of nine. Twelve appears to be the number in his view, connected with all that is important and venerable, either sacred or profane, ancient or modem; but as I, unfortunately, do not possess the lights by which he was guided, I cannot help thinking that fourteen is a much better number than twelve, although it may not be so good for division; and although I cannot quote the fourteen Apostles, or the fourteen Tables, or the fourteen wise men. It will, indeed, divide by seven, which is more than can be said of twelve; but I rely not upon that superiority: it has another arithmetical quality of more importance. Though neither so divisable, nor so beautiful, nor so classical as twelve, it contains two more units than twelve&#x2014;beats it by two beyond all doubt or cavil; and that superiority recommends it for my present purpose. If twelve was beautiful in the days of lord Coke, fourteen must now, I fear, on this account take its place: for how any one can suppose, that twelve men can be able to do now, what they were only able to do centuries ago, is to me matter of astonishment; now, that they have seven or eight hundred causes to try, where they formerly had but thirty or forty, and when we know, that in the time of lord Mansfield, in the late reign, sixty was reckoned a large entry.<lb/>
This, Sir, is one of the illustrations which I would give to expose the heedless folly of those who charge the Bench and the Bar with causing all the delays in legal proceedings. How can it be expected, that twelve judges can go through the increased and increasing business now, when the affairs of men are so extended and multiplied in every direction, the same twelve, and at one time fifteen, having not been much more than sufficient for the comparatively trifling number of causes tried two or three centuries ago? But, there is a far more unthinking and more dangerous prejudice to which the same topic is a complete refutation&#x2014;I mean the outcry against innovation, set up as often as any one proposes those reforms, rendered necessary by the changes that time, the great innovator, is perpetually making.&#x2014;<i>Tempus novatur rerum</i>.&#x2014;Those who advise an increase of the judges beyond their present number are not innovators. The innovators are, in truth, those who would stand still while the world is going forward,&#x2014;who would only employ
<image src="S2V0018P0I0078"/>
<col>141</col>
the same number of labourers while the harvest has increased ten-fold,&#x2014;who, adhering to the ancient system of having but twelve judges, although the work for them to do has incalculably increased, refuse to maintain the original equality, the pristine fitness of the means to the end, the old efficiency and adequacy of the establishment; but they are not innovators who would apply additional power when the pressure exceeds all former bounds&#x2014;who, when the labour is changed, would alter the price of workmen employed, and thus preserve the proportions that originally existed in the judicial system&#x2014;who would most literally keep things as they were, or return them to their primitive state by restoring and perpetuating their former adaptation and harmony. The advantage of the addition I am recommending will become the more evident, when I consider the Welsh judicature, which I believe to be the worst that was ever established. Why should not the two judges be received amongst the others, and divide the Welsh circuits with the old ones? Not that I mean they should always take those circuits, but each might take them in his turn, as each in his turn might sit in the court of King's-bench and Common Pleas, and at the Old Bailey, besides dividing with the chiefs the sittings at Nisi Prius.<sup>*</sup><lb/>
There are two observations, Sir, which I have to make relative to the judges generally, and which I may as well state now I am upon that subject. I highly approve of paying these learned persons by salaries, and not by fees, as a general principle; but, so long as it is the practice not to promote the judges, which I deem essential to the independence of the bench, and so long as the door is thus closed to all ambition, so long must we find a tendency in them, as in all men arrived at their resting place, to become less strenuous in their exertions than they would be if some little stimulus were applied to them. They have an irksome and an arduous duty to perform, and if no motive
<quote><sup>*</sup> The three puisne judges thus sitting in banco, the fourth would each term take bail, and insolvents and common motions in the morning, and chamber business afterwards; he would also take the sittings in term, a serious inconvenience at present; and he might dispose of certain classes of cases after term, as undefended causes and bills of exchange.</quote>
<col>142</col>
be held out to them, the natural consequence must be, as long as men are men, that they will have a disposition growing with their years to do as little as possible. I, therefore, would hold out an inducement to them to labour vigorously, by allowing them a certain moderate amount of fees: I say, a very moderate amount, a very small addition to their fixed salary, would operate as an incentive; and if this were thought expedient, it ought to be so ordered that such fees should not be in proportion to the length of a suit, or the number of its stages, but that the amount should be fixed and defined once for all, in each piece of business finally disposed of. I am quite aware that this mode of payment is not likely to meet with general support, especially with the support of the reformers of the law; but I give the suggestion as the result of long reflection, which has produced a leaning in my mind towards some such a plan. I throw out the matter for inquiry, as the fruit of actual observation, and not from any fancy that I have in my own head; but I may also mention, that some friends of the highest rank and largest experience in the profession, agree with me in this point, men who are among the soundest and most zealous supporters of reform in the courts of law.<lb/>
The other general observation that I have to make, with respect to the judges, is of a nature entirely different from the last which I have submitted to the House. The great object of every government, in electing the judges of the land, should be to obtain the most skilful and learned men in their profession, and at the same time, the men whose character gives the best security for the pure and impartial administration of justice. I almost feel ashamed, Sir, to have troubled you with such a truism; but the House will presently see the application I am about to make of it. Sorry am I to say, that our system of judicial promotion sins in both these particulars. Government ought to fill the bench with men taken from among the most learned lawyers and most accomplished advocates&#x2014;men who have both knowledge of the depths of jurisprudence and sagacity to apply it&#x2014;men who, from experience as leading advocates possess the power of taking large and enlightened views of questions, and of promptly seizing the bearings of a case. There cannot be a greater error than theirs
<image src="S2V0018P0I0079"/>
<col>143</col>
who fancy that an able advocate makes a bad judge; all experience is against it. The best judges in my time, with the exception of the present Lord Chief Justice, than whom no man can discharge his office more excellently and efficiently, have all of them been previously distinguished as advocates in the profession. But not only should the choice be unconfined by the legal acquirements and professional habits of the practitioner, there ought not to be, in choosing judges from the bar, any exclusion or restriction. He alone ought to be selected, in whom talent, integrity, and experience most abound, and are best united. The office of judge is one of so important and responsible a nature, that one should suppose the members of government would naturally require that they should be at liberty to make their selection from the whole field of the profession&#x2014;that they would themselves claim to have the whole field open to their choice. Who could suppose that a ministry would not eagerly seek to have all men before them, when their object must be to choose the most able and accomplished? But, although this is obvious and undeniable, and although the extension of the ministers' search cannot fail to be attended with the highest public advantage, as well as the greatest relief to him in performing his trust, is it the case that any such general and uncontrolled choice is exercised? Is all the field really open? Are there no portions of the domain excluded from the selectors' authority? True, no law prevents such a search for capacity and worth&#x0021; True, the doors of Westminster-hall stand open to the minister&#x0021; He may enter those gates, and choose the ablest and the best men there. Be his talent what it may, be his character what it may, be his party what it may, no man to whom the offer is made will refuse to be a judge. But there is a custom above the law&#x2014;a custom, in my mind, "more honoured in the breach than the observance," that party, as well as merit, must be studied in these appointments. One half of the bar is thus excluded from the competition; for no man can be a judge who is not of a particular party. Unless he be the known adherent of a certain system of government,&#x2014;unless he profess himself devoted to one scheme of policy,&#x2014;unless his party happen to be the party connected with the Crown, or allied with the ministry of the day, there
<col>144</col>
is no chance for him; that man is surely excluded. Men must be on one side of the great political question to become judges; and no one may hope to fill that dignified office, unless he belongs to the side on which courtly favour shines; his seat on the bench must depend, generally speaking, on his supporting the leading principles of the existing administration.<lb/>
But perhaps, Sir, I may be carrying this distinction too far, and it may be said, that the ministers do not expect the opinions of a judge should exactly coincide with theirs in political matters. Be it so; I stop not to cavil about trifles; but, at all events, it must be admitted that, if a man belongs to a party opposed to the views of government; if, which the best and ablest of men, and the fittest for the bench, may well be, he is known for opinions hostile to the ministry, he can expect no promotion&#x2014;rather let me say, the country has no chance of his elevation to the bench, whatever be his talents, or how conspicuously soever he may shine in all the most important departments of his profession. No one, I think, will venture to deny this; or, if he do, I defy him to show me any instance in the course of the last hundred years, of a man, in party fetters, and opposed to the principles of government, being raised to the bench. No such thing has taken place that I know of. Never have I heard of such a thing, at least in England; though we have, perhaps, known instances of men who have changed their party, to arrive at the heights of their profession. But on this subject, desirous throughout of avoiding all offence, I will not press&#x2014;I do not wish to say a word about it.<lb/>
In Scotland, it is true, a more liberal policy has been adopted, and the right hon. gentleman opposite has done himself great honour by recommending Mr. Gillies, Mr. Cranstoun (now lords Gillies and Carrhouse), and Mr. Clerk, (lord Eldin) all as well known for party-men there as lord Eldon is here. Two other instances should be added&#x2014;the lord Chief Commissioner, who has had the signal happiness of presiding over the introduction of jury trial into his native country, and Mr. Cathcart and lord Alloway; though, unfortunately, their party has been what is now once more termed, the wrong side; but all men of the very highest eminence among the professors of the law. Now, when I quote these instances in Scotland,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0080"/>
<col>145</col>
I want to see examples of the same sort in England; for, however great my respect for the law and the people of the North may be, I cannot help thinking, that we of the South too, and our jurisprudence, are of some little importance, and that the administration of justice here may fairly call for some portion of attention. But, Sir, what is our system? If, at the present moment, the whole of Westminster-hall were to be called in the event of any vacancy unfortunately occurring among the chief justices, to name the man best suited to fill it, to point out the individual whose talents and integrity best deserved the situation&#x2014;whose judicial exertions were the most likely to shed blessings on his country&#x2014;can any one doubt for a moment whose name would be echoed on every side? No; there could be no question as to the individual to whom would point the common consent of those most competent to judge; but, then, he is known as a party-man, and all his merits, were they even greater than they are, would be in vain extolled by his profession, and in vain desiderated by his country. I reprobate this mischievous system by which the empire loses the services of some of the ablest, the most learned, and most honest, men within its bounds.<lb/>
And here let me not be supposed to blame one party more than another; I speak of the practice of all governments in this country; and, I believe, when the Whigs were in office, in 1806, they did not promote to the bench any of their political opponents; they had no vacancies in Westminster-hall to fill up, but in the Welsh judicature they pursued the accustomed course. Now, what is the consequence of thus carrying party-principles into judicial appointments? The choice of judges is fettered by being confined to half the profession; so that you have less chance of able men; and those you get are of necessity partisans, and, therefore, less honest and impartial. Why should the whole bench be Ministerial or Tory? No man can desire it to be so, for the purposes of judging over a community, far, very far, from being Ministerial or Tory. Yet it must be so, unless vacancies should occur during those visits of Whig ministries, "few and far between," when once in a quarter of a century power falls upon that party, and then spreads its wings and flies from them in a few months.
<col>146</col>
Does not this arrangement instil into the minds, both of expectant judges and of men already on the bench, a feeling of party fatal to strict justice in political questions? I speak impartially, but unhesitatingly on this point, for it is perfectly notorious, that now-a-days, whenever a question comes before the bench, whether it be upon a prosecution for libel, or upon any other matter connected with politics, the council at their meeting take for granted that they can tell pretty accurately the leaning of the judges, and predict exactly enough which way the consultation of the judges will terminate, though they may not always discover the particular path which will lead to that termination. While the system I complain of continues, while you suffer it to continue, such a leaning is its necessary consequence. The judges have this leaning&#x2014;they must have it&#x2014;they cannot help having it&#x2014;you compel them to have it&#x2014;you choose them on account of their notoriously having it at the bar; and you vainly hope that they will suddenly put it off, when they rise by its means to the bench. On the contrary, they know they fill a certain situation, and they cannot forget by whom they were placed there, or for what reason.<lb/>
There is no doubt that the present judges will always discharge their functions with all the impartiality that any man can expect from them; but I speak without reference to individual habits or prejudices&#x2014;I speak of impressions which it is natural to expect must exist, where circumstances all conspire to create them; I speak, too, I must be allowed to say, quite disinterestedly. I cannot take the situation of a judge&#x2014;I cannot afford it. I speak not for myself, but for the country, because I feel it to be a matter of the deepest importance; and from what I have seen of the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Peel), I really do hope to see this matter much more maturely weighed, than it has heretofore been.<lb/>
ii.&#x2014;I am afraid that I have already tired the House with the length of these details; but I must now take my leave, for a time, of Westminster-hall, and beg of you to mark, in the next place, the manner in which the law is administered in Wales. Why should Wales, because it happens to be termed the Principality, have the rights of property, and the personal privileges of the inhabitants, dealt with by different judges, and almost by a,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0081"/>
<col>147</col>
different system from that which is established in England? In England you have the first men&#x2014;men of the highest education and experience&#x2014;to sit in judgment on life and property. In Wales you have as judges, I will net say inferior men, but certainly not the very first, nor in any respect such as sit upon what Roger North calls the "cushion in Westminster-hall." I shall here show three great defects requiring a remedy most imperatively. Oftentimes, those gentlemen have left the bar, and retired to the pursuits of country gentlemen. I do not say that they are, for that reason, unfit for the office of judge, but still they cannot, be so competent as men in the daily administration of the law, and forming part of our Supreme courts. In some cases they continue in Westminster-hall&#x2014;which is so much the worse,&#x2014;because a man who is a judge one half the year, and a barrister the other, is not likely to be either a good judge or a good barrister. But a second and a greater objection is, that the Welsh judges never change their circuits. One of them, for instance, goes the Carmarthen circuit, another the Brecon circuit, and a third the Chester circuit&#x2014;but always the same circuit. And what is the inevitable consequence? Why, they become acquainted with the gentry, the magistrates, almost with the tradesmen of each district, the very witnesses who come before them, and intimately with the practitioners, whether counsel or attorney. The names, the faces, the characters, the histories, of all those persons are familiar to them; and out of this too great knowledge grow likings and prejudices which never can by any possibility cast a shadow over the open, broad, and pure path of the judges of Westminster-hall. Then again they have no retiring pensions, and the consequence is, they retain their salaries long after they have ceased to discharge, properly, the functions for which they receive them. Now mark the result of all this. On one of the Welsh circuits, at the last Spring Assizes, there were set down no more than forty-six causes for trial; and how many does the House think were disposed of? Only twenty, and of the twenty-six made remanets, are some that had stood over from the preceding assizes. It is evident enough what should be done here. If any of the judges of the Principality have become, from the extreme pressure of business on the one hand, or from any
<col>148</col>
physical cause on the other, inadequate to the discharge of the business which comes before them, pension them off&#x2014;if they be barristers yet remaining in Westminster-hall, and not fit to be raised to the bench, pension them off too: sure I am, that theirs will be the cheapest pension, nay, the most beneficial to the giver, "being twice blessed," which has ever been bestowed. I verily think that the Principality would itself cheerfully pay this first cost of a better system. At all events, add two judges to your present number, and let them take, with the other twelve, their turn and share in the business of the country. Let the Principality of Wales be divided into two circuits, and then you will have the work well done, and quickly done, especially if you transfer the equity jurisdiction to the two courts of Westminster. In addition to this, from the accession to the present number of judges, the existing difficulties arising from the bail court and the chamber practice will be done away.<lb/>
And here, before passing to another head of judicature, the times of the circuits require a word or two. Not, perhaps, that this is of so much importance as the other defects I have already noticed, or shall presently touch upon; but it regards classes of great importance in themselves, judges, barristers, and solicitors; and it touches also, in no little degree, the conveniency of the community at large. I should be most glad to see that folly&#x2014;for really I cannot call it by any other name&#x2014;that absurd and vexatious folly of regulating Easter term by means of the <i>moon</i>, done away with. It is said by many that this would be difficult to reform. I see no such difficulty in the matter. Let the law returns be made certain, and leave the moveable feast to the church. I have no wish to interfere with the terms and seasons of the church; let those be regulated as you please; but let this inconvenience in the law be remedied, by making, for Easter and Trinity terms, like those for Michaelmas and Hilary, the returns on some certain days. I remember that when the late Mr. Erskine brought in a bill, in 1802, to fix Easter term, a learned judge delivered himself in print against the dangerous innovation; and some persons, alarmed by him, exclaimed, "Only imagine the horror of attempting to change Easter term, when all Christians throughout the world have at present the unspeak-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0082"/>
<col>149</col>
able comfort of knowing that they are keeping this great festival upon one and the same day." For my part, I have no wish to deprive them of this comfort, admitting it, as I do, to be unspeakable. The day upon which Good Friday falls may be determined as heretofore, that is, by the period of the full moon; by the same certain varying rule may Easter Sunday be fixed for all clerical purposes; but temporal business ought not to be sacrificed to these ideas of some undefined spiritual consolation. There is no inconvenience in Easter being moveable, but there is a very great inconvenience in making the law returns moveable. Why not, then, let the feasts of the Church remain changeable as heretofore, and the Terms of the courts, little enough connected with sacred things, fall at a stated period? Let it be counted, for example, from Lady-day, which is always on the 25th of March. But why, indeed, must we continue to count from Saints' days, now that we have happily a very Protestant country, more especially under the government of the present Commander-in-chief? Why preserve any Romish folly of this sort, and keep up a mere remnant of popery? Let Easter Term always begin on the 10th of April, or on the 5th, and the inconvenience will cease. It is the foolishest of vulgar errors to suppose, that, by how much the more you vex and harass the professors of the law, by so much the more you benefit the country. The fact is quite the reverse: for by these means you make inferior men, both in feelings, and in accomplishments, alone follow that profession out of which the judges of the land must be appointed. I should rather say, that by how much the more you surround this renowned profession with difficulties and impediments, calculated only to make it eligible for persons of mere ordinary education, and mere habits of drudgery, who otherwise would find their way to employment in tradesmen's shops, or at best in merchants' counting-houses&#x2014;by so much the more you close it upon men of talent and respectability, and prevent it from being the resort of genius and of liberal accomplishments. I apprehend, therefore, that, the convenience of the Bar is a matter which the legislature ought never to lose sight of, where it clashes not with the advantage of the suitor. The having the Terms which are moveable (Easter and Trinity), and
<col>150</col>
the circuit, and the long vacation, earlier by four or five weeks in one year, and later by four or five weeks in another, is a most serious inconvenience in itself, and quite unnecessary upon any principle. Only observe how hard the present system bears, for instance, upon those who, like myself, frequent the Northern circuit. It happened to me, that I did not get home till the 20th of September last year, having repaired to London on the 5th of October the year before, so that I was engaged in my profession for eleven months and a half, and having been gratified, out of the twelve months, by exactly one fortnight's vacation for needful repose, when I should have been obliged again to bend my steps towards Guildhall, appointed to open on the 9th of October, I naturally enough joined those who signed a requisition to my lord Tenterden, entreating him to defer the sittings. His lordship most handsomely expressed his willingness to meet the wishes of the gentlemen of the bar, kindly returning the affectionate respect which all who practise in his court bear to his person. He stated his satisfaction at being able to accommodate us, by sitting on Tuesday the 16th, instead of Tuesday the 9th, so that we obtained a week, for which we were thankful. My lord observed, that in the state of his paper he could grant us no more; indeed, such is his resolution manfully and honestly to despatch his business, that he seems to take as much interest in his work as others do in their relaxation.<lb/>
That his lordship's paper was far too heavy, there cannot be a doubt, and so it will always be. No one judge can get through the mass of causes entered in the King's-bench, trying them patiently and really hearing them to an end. Depend upon it, when more have been tried in the same time, they have been half heard and forced to compromise or reference. Now, if you will have two judges sitting at <i>Nisi Prius</i> at once, each of them taking a particular class of trials&#x2014;the one confining himself to the heavy business, and the other to bills of exchange, promissory note cases, and undefended causes generally&#x2014;the whole business of the court could be got through both thoroughly and with despatch; but, as the law now stands, it is utterly impossible for any man, in days consisting of no more than twenty-four hours, and labouring for eleven months in the year, to dispose of the business before
<image src="S2V0018P0I0083"/>
<col>151</col>
him. I say eleven months, for the Court, with the exception of a day or two of respite at Easter, and a week at Christmas, sat for eleven months last year, taking the circuits as part of the year's work.<lb/>
Another obvious distribution might be made without having two judges sitting together in one court. If, as all real actions have their domicile in the Common Pleas, actions which, in their nature, partake of real actions, as ejectments, trespass to try title, and so forth, might be carried there too. Other suits might be susceptible of a similar classification, as if actions respecting tithes, which are not frequent, bills of exchange, and promissory notes, were carried into the court of Exchequer. The lord chief Baron is allowed, by the 57th of Geo. 3rd, to sit in Equity and to hear alone, all causes and all motions in equity; but he never, in fact, does hear motions, although certainly no lawyer ever sat in that court more fitted to despatch any branch of Equity practice than is the present head of the Exchequer. Were he confined to the equity side, and were another judge, a common lawyer, appointed to preside on the law side of that court, you would have two effective courts, instead of one not very effective for either law or equity. The court of Chancery would be materially relieved by this arrangement; while the double good would be found of the business being better done both on the bench and at the bar, from that expertness which ever attends the division of labour; and of seasonable relief being afforded to both the judges and practitioners of the King's-bench, who would be restored to something of the leisure, at least the moderate professional employment, so favourable to the liberal pursuits and unfettered study of jurisprudence, which have always formed the most accomplished lawyers.<lb/>
iii.&#x2014;I now pass to the Civil Law courts; and their constitution I touch with a tender, and, I may say, a trembling hand, knowing that, from my little experience of their practice, I am scarcely competent to discourse of them; for I profess to speak only from such knowledge as I have obtained incidentally from practising in the two courts of Appeal, the high court of Delegates, and the Cock-pit, where I have been occasionally associated with the civilians. The observations I have to make on this part of the subject resolve themselves, entirely, into those which I would
<col>152</col>
offer upon the manner in which their judges are appointed and paid. In the first place, I would have them better paid than they are now; a reform to which I would fain hope there may be no serious objection on their part, averse, as I know them, generally, to all change. I think they are underpaid in respect of the most important part of their functions. The judge of the high court of Admiralty, who has the highest situation, or almost the highest, among the judges of the land (for there is none of them who decides upon questions of greater delicacy and moment, in a national view, or involving a larger amount of property)&#x2014;this great dignitary of the law has 2,500<i>l</i>. a-year salary only. The rest of his income is composed of fees, and these are little or nothing during peace. But, then, in time of war, they amount to seven or eight thousand per annum. I profess not to like the notion of a functionary, who has so many calls, as the judge of the Admiralty court, for dealing with the most delicate neutral questions&#x2014;for drawing up manifestos and giving opinions on these questions, and advising the Crown in matters of public policy bearing on our relations with foreign states;&#x2014;I like not, I say, the notion of such a personage being subject to the dreadful bias (and here, again, I am speaking on general principles only, and with no personal reference whatever) as he is likely to receive from the circumstance of his having a salary of 2,500<i>l</i>. per annum only, if a state of peace continue, and between ten or eleven thousand a year, if it be succeeded by war. I know very well, Sir that no feeling of this kind could possibly influence the present noble judge of that court; but I hardly think it a decent thing to underpay him in time of peace, and still less decent is it, to overpay him at a period when the country is engaged in a war. I conceive that it may not always be safe to make so large an increase to a judge's salary dependent upon whether the horrors of war or the blessings of peace frown or smile upon his country&#x2014;to bestow upon one, eminently mixed up with questions on which the continuance of tranquillity, or its restoration when interrupted, may hinge, a revenue, conditioned upon the coming on, and the endurance of hostilities.<lb/>
The other remark, which I have to offer on these courts, I would strongly press
<image src="S2V0018P0I0084"/>
<col>153</col>
upon the consideration of the House; it relates to the mode in which their judges are appointed. Is it a fit thing, I ask, now, when Popery is no longer cherished or even respected, indeed hardly tolerated, among us&#x2014;that one of its worst practices should remain, the appointment of some of the most eminent judges in the Civil Law courts by prelates of the Church? I except, indeed, the judge of the high court of Admiralty, because his commission proceeds from the Lord High Admiral; but I speak of all those who preside in the Consistorial courts&#x2014;who determine the most grave and delicate questions of spiritual law, marriage, and divorce, and may decide on the disposition by will of all the personalty in the kingdom. Is it a fit thing that the judges in these most important matters should be appointed, not by the Crown, not by removable and responsible officers of the Crown&#x2014;but by the archbishop of Canterbury and bishop of London, who are neither removable nor responsible&#x2014;who are not lawyers&#x2014;who are not statesmen&#x2014;who ought to be no politicians&#x2014;who are, indeed, priests of the highest order, but not, on that account, the most proper persons to appoint judges of the highest order? So it is in the province of York, where the judges are appointed by the archbishop; so in all other Consistorial courts, where the judges are appointed by the bishops of the respective dioceses in which they are situated. From their courts an appeal lies, it is true, to the court of Delegates, in the last resort; but, so far from this affording an adequate remedy, it is an additional evil; for I will venture to affirm, that the Delegates is one of the worst constituted courts which was ever appointed, and that the course of its proceedings forms one of the greatest mockeries of appeal ever conceived by man. And I shall demonstrate this to you in a very few words. The Court is thus formed:&#x2014;You take three judges from the Common Law courts, one from each: to these you add some half dozen civil lawyers, advocates from Doctors' Commons, who the day before may have been practising in those courts, but who happen not to have been in the particular cause, in respect of which the appeal has been asserted. Now, only see what the consequence of this must be. The civilians, forming the majority of the Delegates, are, of necessity, men who have no practice, or the very youngest of the
<col>154</col>
doctors. So that you absolutely appeal from the three great judges of the Civil and Maritime courts&#x2014;from the sentences of sir William Scott, sir John Nicholl, and sir Christopher Robinson&#x2014;of those learned and experienced men, who are to us the great luminaries of the Civil law&#x2014;the venerated oracles best fitted to guide our path through all the difficulties of that branch of the science, and open to us its dark passages&#x2014;you appeal from them to judges, the majority of whom must, of necessity, be the advocates the least employed in the courts where those great authorities preside, the most recently admitted to those courts, and the most unqualified to pronounce soundly on their I proceedings, if it were decent that they should pronounce at all; for, out of so small a bar, the chances are, that the three or four eminent advocates have been employed in the case under appeal. Thus the absurdity is really much the same as if you were to appeal from a solemn and elaborate judgment, pronounced by my lord Tenterden, Mr. Justice Bayley, Mr.; Justice Holroyd, and Mr. Justice Little-dale, to the judgment of three young barristers, called but the day before, and three older ones, who never could obtain any practice.<lb/>
Sir, I have spoken of the primate and his principal suffragan; and I hope I need not protest, especially while I have the pleasure of addressing you, that what I have said of the privilege belonging to the highest dignitary in the Church, my observations were meant to be most remote indeed from every thing like personal disrespect; towards no persons in their exalted station do I bear a more profound respect than to both the distinguished prelates I have named, well knowing the liberality of their conduct in exercising the powers I am objecting to, as all the country knows the extent of learning and integrity of character which have made them the ornaments of our hierarchy.<lb/>
iv.&#x2014;I next come to speak of the Privy Council; a very important judicature, and of which the members discharge as momentous duties as any of the judges of this country, having to determine not only upon questions of Colonial Law in Plantation cases, but to sit also as judges, in the last resort, of all Prize causes. The point, however, to which I more immediately address myself on this head is, that they hear and decide upon all our Plantation
<image src="S2V0018P0I0085"/>
<col>155</col>
appeals. They are thus made the supreme judges, in the last resort, over every one of our foreign settlements, whether situated in those immense territories which you possess in the East; where you and a trading company together rule over not less than Seventy millions of subjects; or are established among those rich and populous islands which stud the Indian Ocean, and form the great Eastern Archipelago; or have their stations in those lands, part lying within the Tropics; part stretching towards the Pole, peopled by various castes differing widely in habits, still more widely in privileges; great in numbers, abounding in wealth, extremely unsettled in their notions of right, and excessively litigious, as all the children of the New World are supposed to be, both from their physical and political constitution. All this immense jurisdiction over the rights of property and person, over rights political and legal; and all the questions growing out of such a vast and varied province, is exercised by the privy council unaided and alone. It is obvious that, from the mere distance of those colonies, and the immense variety of matters arising in them, foreign to our habits, and beyond the scope of our knowledge, any judicial tribunal in this country must, of necessity, be an extremely inadequate court of review. But what adds incredibly to the difficulty is, that hardly any two of the colonies can be named which have the same law; and in the greater number the law is wholly unlike our own. In some Settlements, it is the Dutch law; in others the Spanish, in others the French, in others the Danish. In out Eastern possessions these variations are, if possible, yet greater: while one territory is swayed by the Mohammedan law, another is ruled by the native or Hindu law, and this again, in some of our possessions, is qualified or superseded by the law of Budda, the English jurisprudence being Confined to the handful of British settlers, and the inhabitants of the three presidencies. All these laws must come, in their turns, in review, before the necessarily ignorant privy councillor, after the learned doctors in each have differed. The difficulty thus Arising of necessity from our distance, an unavoidable incident to our colonial empire, may almost be deemed an incapacity, for it involves both ignorance of the law, and unfitness to judge of the facts. But so much the more anxious should we be to remove every unnecessary
<col>156</col>
obstacle to right judgment, and to use all the correctives in our power. The judges should be men of the largest legal and general information, accustomed to study other systems of law beside our own, and associated with lawyers who have practised and presided in the colonial courts. They should be assisted by a bar limiting its practice, for the most part, to this Appeal Court, at arty rate making it their principal object. To counteract, in some degree, the delays necessarily arising from the distance of the courts below, and give ample time for patient inquiry into so dark and difficult matters, the Court of Review should sit frequently and regularly at all seasons. Because all these precautions would still leave much to wish for, that is no kind of reason why you should not anxiously adopt them. On the contrary, it is your bounden duty, among those countless millions whom you desire to govern all over the globe, not to suffer a single Unnecessary addition to the inevitable impediments which the remote position of the seat of empire throws in the way of correct and speedy justice. Widely different are our arrangements. The privy council, which ought to be held more regularly than any other court, sits far less constantly than any, having neither a regular bench nor a regular bar. It only meets on certain extraordinary days&#x2014;the 30th of January, the Feast of the Purification, some day in May, Midsummer-day, and a few others. I find, on an average of twelve years, ending 1826, it sat in each year nine days, to dispose of all the appeals from all the British subjects in India; from our own civil courts, to the jurisdiction of which all our subjects are locally amenable, throughout the wide extent of the several presidencies of Calcutta, 'Bombay, and Madras; to dispose of all the causes which come up from the three several native courts of last resort, the Sudder Adawluts, from the two inferior courts of Zilla and Circuit, comprising all contested suits between the Hindoos, the half-caste people, and the Mahomedan inhabitants. But in the same nine days are to be disposed of, all the appeals from Ceylon, the Mauritius, the Cape, and New Holland; from our colonies in the West Indies and in North America; from our settlements in the Mediterranean, and from the islands in the Channel;&#x2014;nine days sittings are deemed sufficient for the decision of the whole. But nine days do
<image src="S2V0018P0I0086"/>
<col>157</col>
not suffice, nor any thing like it, for this purpose; and the summary I have in my hand demonstrates it both by what it contains, and by what it does not. It appears that, in all those twelve years taken together, the appeals have amounted to but few in number. I marvel that they are so few&#x2014;and yet I marvel not; for, in point of fact, you have no adequate tribunal to dispose of them; and the want of such a tribunal is an absolute denial of justice to the native subjects of the Crown in those colonies. The total number is only 467; but, Including about 50, which came from India, and appear not to have been regularly entered, though they are still undisposed of, there are 517. Of these 243 only have been disposed of; but only 129 have been heard, for the others were either compromised from hopelessness owing to the delay which had intervened between the appeal and the sentence, or dismissed for want of prosecution. Consequently, the privy council must have heard ten or eleven appeals only per year, or little more than one in the course of each day's sitting. Again, of the 129 which were heard and disposed of, no less than 56 were decided against the original sentences, being altered, but, generally speaking, wholly reversed. Now, 56 out of 129 is a very large proportion, little less than one half; and clearly shows that the limited number of appeals must have risen, not from the want of cases where revision was required, but from the apprehension of finding no adequate court of review, or no convenient despatch of business. And that the sentences in the colonies should oftentimes be found ill-digested, or hasty, or ignorant, can be no matter of astonishment, when we find a bold lieutenant-general Lord Chancellor in one court, and an enterprising captain president in another; and a worthy major officiating as judge-advocate in a third. In many of these cases, a learned and gallant Lord Chancellor has decided, in the court below, points of the greatest legal nicety; and the Judges of Appeal, who are to set him right here, are chosen without much more regard to legal aptitude; for you are not to suppose that the business of these nine days upon which they sit is all transacted before lawyers: one lawyer there may be, but the rest are laymen. Certainly a right honourable gentleman whom I see opposite to me is there sometimes by chance, and his presence is sure to be attended with
<col>158</col>
great advantage to us. Occasionally we see him or my learned friend, his predecessor (Mr. Abercromby), but this good fortune is rare; the Master of the Rolls alone is always to be seen there, of the lawyers; for the rest, one meets sometimes in company with him, an elderly and most respectable gentleman, who has formerly been an ambassador, and was a governor with much credit to himself in difficult times; and now and then a junior Lord of the Admiralty, who has been neither ambassador nor lawyer, but would be exceedingly fit for both functions, only that he happened to be educated for neither. And such, Sir, is the constitution of that awful Privy Council which sits at Westminster, making up, for its distance from the suitors, by the regularity of its sittings, and for its ignorance of local laws and usages, by the extent and variety of its general law learning; this is the court which determines, without appeal, and in a manner the most summary that can be conceived in this country, all those Most important matters which come before it. For instance, I once saw property worth thirty thousand pounds sterling per annum, disposed of in a few minutes, after the arguments at the bar ended, by the learned members of the Privy Council, who reversed a sentence pronounced by all the judges in the settlement, upon no less than nineteen days most anxious discussion. Such court, whose decisions are without appeal,&#x2014;irreversible, unless by act of parliament&#x2014;is the supreme tribunal which dispenses the law to eighty millions of people, and disposes of their property.<lb/>
I cannot pass from this subject without relating a fact which illustrates the consequences of the delays necessarily incident to such a jurisdiction. The Ranee, or queen of Ramnad, having died, a question arose among the members of her family, respecting the succession to the vacant musnud (or throne), and to the personal property of the deceased sovereign, as well as the territorial revenue. The situation of the country, as well as its population and wealth, render it a province of some note. It reckons four hundred thousand inhabitants, and it lies in the direct road which the pilgrims from the south of India take to the sanctuary in the island of Remisram, frequented by them as much as the Juggernaut is by those of the north. On the death of her highness in 1809, proceedings commenced
<image src="S2V0018P0I0087"/>
<col>159</col>
in the courts below, upon the disputed succession; an appeal to the king in counsel was lodged in 1814; it is still pending. And what has been the consequence of this delay of justice? Why, that the kingdom of Ramnad has been all this time in the keeping of sheriffs' officers, excepting the honourable company's peshcush, or share of the revenues, which, I have no manner of doubt, has been faithfully exacted to the last rupee. It is strictly in what amounts to the same thing as the custody of sheriffs' officers, having been taken, as I may say, in execution; or rather by a kind of mesne process, such as we have not in our law.<lb/>
As the papers on the table, to which I have referred, show so much fewer appeals from the plantations than might have been expected, it is fit now to remind the House how equivocal a symptom this is of full justice being done. It is the worst of all follies, the most iniquitous, as well as the most mistaken, kind of policy, to stop litigation&#x2014;not by affording a cheap and expeditious remedy, but by an absolute denial of justice, in the difficulties which distance, ignorance, expense, and delay produce. The distance you cannot remove, if you would; the ignorance it is hardly more practicable to get rid of: then, for God's sake, why not give to these your foreign subjects, what you have it in your power to bestow&#x2014;a speedy and cheap administration of justice? This improvement in the court of appeal would create more business, indeed, but justice would no longer be taxed and delayed, and in the cost and the delay be denied. But if you would safely, and without working injustice, stop appeals from the colonies, carry your reforms thither also: I should say, for instance, that a reform of the judicatures of India would be matter most highly deserving the consideration of his majesty's government. I am at a loss to know, why there should be so rigorous an exclusion of jury trials from the native courts of India. I know, and every one must know, who has taken the trouble to inquire, that the natives are eminently capable of applying their minds to the evisceration of truth in judicial inquiries; that they possess powers; of discrimination, ready ingenuity, and sagacity in a very high degree; and that where they have been admitted so to exercise those powers, they have been found most careful and intelligent assistants in aiding the investigations of the judge.
<col>160</col>
But I know also that your present mode of administering justice to these native subjects, is such as I can hardly speak of without shame. Look at your local judges&#x2014;at their fitness for judicial functions. A young writer goes out to India; he is appointed a judge, and he repairs to his station, to make money, by distributing justice, if he can, but, at all events, to make money. In total ignorance of the manners, the customs, the prejudices, possibly of the language, of those upon whose affairs and conduct he is to sit in judgment, and by whose testimony he is to pursue his inquiries, and very possibly equally uninformed of the laws he is to administer&#x2014;he must needs be wholly dependent upon his Pundit for direction both as to matter of fact and matter of law, and, most probably, becomes a blind passive tool in the hands of a designing minister.<lb/>
The House will not suppose that I mean to insinuate for a moment the possibility of suspicion as to the wilful misconduct of the judge in this difficult position. I am very sure that the party who may happen to occupy that high office would rather cut off his right hand, if the alternative were put to him, than take the bribe of a paria to misdecide a cause that came before him. But I am by no means so secure of the Pundit upon whom the judge must necessarily be dependent; and while he is both less trust-worthy and wholly irresponsible, the purity of the responsible, but passive, instrument in his hands is a thing of perfect insignificance. The experiment of trial by jury, by which this serious evil may in part be remedied, has been already tried. The efforts made by a learned judge of Ceylon, sir Alexander Johnson, to introduce into that colony the British system of justice, manfully supported by the government at home, have been attended with signal success. I am acquainted with a particular case, indeed, the details of which are too long to lay before the House, but which showed the fitness of the natives to form part of a tribunal, notwithstanding the prevalence of strong prejudices in a particular instance among them. A Bramin was put on his trial for murder, and a great feeling excited against him, possibly against his caste. Twelve of the jury were led away by this feeling, and by the very strong case which a subtle conspiracy had contrived against the prisoner,&#x2014;when a young
<image src="S2V0018P0I0088"/>
<col>161</col>
Bramin, the thirteenth juror, examined the evidence with a dexterity and judgment that excited the greatest admiration, and from his knowledge of the habits and manners of the witnesses, together with extraordinary natural sagacity, succeeded in exposing the plot and saving the innocent man. Other considerations there are, less immediately connected with the administration of justice, and which I might press upon the House, to evince the expediency of introducing our system of trial in the East. Nothing could be better calculated to conciliate the minds of the natives than allowing them to form part of the tribunals to which they are subject, and share in administering the laws under which they live. It would give them an understanding of the course of public justice, and of the law by which they are ruled; a fellow feeling with the government which executes it, and an interest in supporting the system in whose powers they participate. The effect of such a proceeding would be, that, in India, as in Ceylon, in the event of a rebellion, the great mass of the people, instead of joining the revolters, would give all their support to the government. This valuable, but not costly fruit of the wise policy pursued in that island, has already been gathered. In 1816, the same people which, twelve years before, had risen against your dynasty, were found marshalled on your side, and helping you to crush rebellion. So will it be in the Peninsula, if you give your subjects a share in administering your laws, and an interest and a pride in supporting you. Should the day ever come when disaffection may appeal to seventy millions, against a few thousand strangers, who have planted themselves upon the ruins of their ancient dynasties, you will find how much safer it is to have won their hearts, and universally cemented their attachment by a common interest in your system, than to rely upon one hundred and fifty thousand Seapoy swords, of excellent temper, but in doubtful hands.<lb/>
v.&#x2014;I now, Sir, come to the administration of law in the country, by Justices of Peace; and I approach this jurisdiction with fear and trembling, when I reflect on what Mr. Windham was accustomed to say, that he dreaded to talk of, the game-laws in a House composed of sportsmen; and so, too, I dread, to talk of the Quorum in an assembly of magistrates. Surrounded as I am with my Honourable Friends, and
<col>162</col>
among Honourable Members on the other side, by gentlemen in the commission, I own that this is a ground on which I have some reluctance to tread. But I have to deal with the principle only, not with the individuals: my reflections are general, not personal. Nevertheless, considering the changes which have been effected in modern times, I cannot help thinking it worth inquiry, whether some amendment might not be made in our justice of peace system? The first doubt which strikes me is, if it be fit that they should be appointed as they are, merely by the Lords Lieutenant of counties, without the interference of the Crown's responsible ministers. It is true, that the Lord Chancellor issues the commission, but it is the Lord Lieutenant who designates the persons to be comprehended in it. Such a thing is hardly ever known as any interference with respect to those individuals on the part of the Lord Chancellor. He looks to the Lord Lieutenant, or rather to the 'Custos Rotulorum,' which the Lord Lieutenant most frequently is (indeed everywhere but in counties Palatine), for the names of proper persons. The Lord Lieutenant, therefore, as Custos Rotulorum, absolutely appoints all the justices of the peace in his county, at his sole will and pleasure. Now I cannot understand what quality is peculiar to a Keeper of the Records, that fits him, above all other men, to say who shall be the judges of the district whose records he keeps. I think it would be about as convenient and natural to let the Master of the Rolls appoint the judges of the land; indeed, more so, for he is a lawyer; or to give the appointment to the Keeper of the State Papers. The Custos Rotulorum may issue a new commission, too, and leave out names; I have known it done, but I have also known it prevented by the Great Seal; indeed, it laid down as a rule by the late Lord Chancellor Eldon, from which no consideration, his Lordship was used to say, should induce him to depart, that however unfit a magistrate might be for his office, either from private misconduct or party feeling, he would never strike that magistrate off the list, until he had been convicted of some offence by the verdict of a Court of Record. Upon this principle he always acted. No doubt his Lordship felt, that, as the Magistrates gave their services gratis, they ought to be protected; but still it is a rule which opens the door to very serious mis-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0089"/>
<col>163</col>
chief and injustice; and I myself could, if necessary, quote cases in which it has been most unfortunately persevered in. On looking, however, at the description of persons who are put into the commission, I am not at all satisfied that the choice is made with competent discretion; and upon this part of the question I may as well declare at once, that I have very great doubts as to the expediency of making Clergymen magistrates. This is a course which, whenever it can be done conveniently, I should certainly be glad to see changed, unless in counties where there are very few resident lay proprietors. My opinion is, that a clerical magistrate, in uniting two very excellent and useful characters, pretty commonly spoils both; and the combination produces what the alchemists call a <i>tertium quid</i>, with very little, indeed, of the good qualities of either ingredient, and no little of the bad ones of both, together with new evils superinduced by the commixture. There is the activity of the magistrate in an excessive degree&#x2014;over-activity is a very high magisterial offence, in my view&#x2014;yet most of the magistrates distinguished for over-activity are clergymen: joined to this are found the local Ratings and likings, and, generally, somewhat narrow-minded opinions and prejudices, which are apt to attach to the character of the resident parish priest, one of the most valuable and respectable if kept pure from political contamination. There are some Lords Lieutenant, I know, who make it a rule never to appoint a clergyman to the magistracy; and I entirely agree in the policy of that course, because the education and the habits of such gentlemen are seldom of a worldly description, and therefore by no means qualify them to discharge the duties of such an office; but, generally speaking, as the House must be aware, through the country the practice is far otherwise. Again, some Lords Lieutenant appoint men for their political opinions&#x2014;some for activity as partisans in local contests; some are so far influenced as to keep out all who take a decided part against themselves in matters where all men should be free to act as their opinions dictate; and in the exercise of this patronage no responsibility whatever substantially exists. Appointed, then, by irresponsible advisers, and irremovable without a conviction, let us now see what is the authority of men so chosen and so secure.<lb/>
<col>164</col>
In the first place, they have the privilege of granting or withholding Licences. As we all know, it lies in the breast of two justices of the peace to give or to refuse this important privilege. It is in their absolute power to give a licence to one of the most unfit persons possible; and it is in their power to refuse a licence to one of the most fit persons possible. They may continue a licence to some person who has had it but a twelvemonth, and who, during that twelvemonth, has made his house a nuisance to the whole neighbourhood; or they may take away a licence from a house to which it has been attached for a century, and the enjoyment of which has not only been attended by no evil, but has been productive of great public benefit. And all this, be it observed, they do without even the shadow of control. There is no rule more certain than that a mandamus does not lie to compel justices either to grant or withhold a licence. I hardly ever remember moving for one; and I only once recollect a rule being granted&#x2014;it was on the motion of, I believe, my honourable and learned friend, the solicitor-general. But I know that great astonishment was expressed on the occasion; that every one asked what he could have stated to make the Court listen to the application; that all took for granted it would be discharged, as a matter of course; which it accordingly was, in less time than I have taken to relate the circumstance. What other control is there over the conduct of the licensing magistrate? I shall be told that he may be proceeded against, either by a criminal information, or by impeachment. As to the latter, no man of common sense would dream of impeaching a magistrate, any more than he would think now-a-days of impeaching a minister. Then, as to proceeding by criminal information: In the first place it is necessary in order to obtain the rule, to produce affidavits, that the magistrate has been influenced by wilful and corrupt motives: not merely affidavits of belief in those who swear, but of facts proving him guilty of malversation in his office. Then, suppose, as not unfrequently happens, a rule obtained on this ex parte statement; the magistrate answers the charges on oath; he swears last, and may touch many points never anticipated by the other party, consequently not answered; and unless the alleged facts remain, upon the discussion, undeniable, and the guilt to be inferred from them
<image src="S2V0018P0I0090"/>
<col>165</col>
seems as clear as the light of day, the rule is discharged with costs. The difficulty of proving corruption is rendered almost insuperable, because all the magistrate has to do, in order to defend himself from the consequences of granting or withholding a licence, is to adopt the short course of saying nothing at the time&#x2014;of keeping his own counsel&#x2014;of abstaining from any statement of his reasons. Let him only give no reason for his conduct, and no power on earth can touch him. He may grant a licence to a common brothel, or he may refuse a licence to one of the most respectable inns on the North road; let him withhold his reasons, and his conduct remains unquestionable; although the real motive by which he is actuated may be, that he is in the habit of using the one house, and that the landlord of the other will not suffer him to use it in the same way. Unless you can show that he has himself stated his motives, or that there are circumstances so strong against him as amount to conviction, you are prevented from even instituting an inquiry on the subject. Thus absolute is the authority of the magistrate with regard to licensing. With the permission of the House, in order to illustrate the abuse of this extensive power, I will read a letter which I received some time ago on the subject of the licensing system, from one of the most worthy and learned individuals in this country&#x2014;a man of large fortune, and of most pure and estimable character&#x2014;who long acted as a magistrate in one of the neighbouring counties.<lb/>
[Mr. B. here read a letter, in which the tendency of justices is stated to favour particular houses, and not take away their licences, though guilty of the grossest irregularities, on the pretence, become a maxim with many of them, that "the house being brick and mortar cannot offend;" whereas a haunt of bad company being established, it becomes the magistrate's duty to break it up. It was also shown how the power of licensing placed millions of property at the disposal of the justices, a licence easily adding 500<i>l</i>. to the value of a lease, and often much more, and the number of victuallers exceeding forty thousand. It further showed the partiality of the bench towards brewers and their houses, especially in Middlesex and the home counties.]<lb/>
I have received a variety of other information upon this subject, all leading to the
<col>166</col>
same result. That which I have described&#x2014;the leaning of justices towards brewers, whom, in licensing, they favour, as brother magistrates, although the latter are not allowed by law to preside at a Brewster sessions, is, perhaps, the most crying evil connected with the system; but who does not know (I am sure I do, in more parts of the kingdom than one or two), that licences are granted, and refused, from election motives? When, some time ago, I brought the Beer bill into this House, I had, of course, an extensive correspondence on the subject; and I was assured by many highly respectable persons, that the evil of this system is by no means confined to the neighbourhood of London, of which they gave me numerous instances. Nor is the licensing power of the magistracy that in which alone great abuses exist. They prevail wheresoever their authority is exercised; in the commitments for offences against the game-laws, in dealing with petty offences against property, in taking cognizance of little assaults, especially on officers, in summary convictions for nonpayment of tithes, and a number of other matters affecting the liberties and property of the subject; and yet, for their conduct in all of which they are not amenable to any superior power, provided, as I have said before, they only keep their own counsel, and abstain from stating the reasons by which they have been actuated, should their motives be evil.<lb/>
There is not a worse constituted tribunal on the face of the earth, not before the Turkish cadi, than that at which summary convictions on the game-laws take place; I mean a bench or a brace of sporting justices. I am far from saying that, on such subjects, they are actuated by corrupt motives; but they are undoubtedly instigated by their abhorrence of that <i>caput lupinum</i> that <i>hostis humani generis</i>, as an honourable friend of mine once called him in his place, that <i>fera nature</i>&#x2014;a poacher. From their decisions on those points, where their passions are the most likely to mislead them, no appeal in reality lies; for, unless they set out any matter illegal on the face of the conviction, you remove the record in vain. Equally supreme are they in cases where sitting in a body at quarter sessions, they decide upon the most important rights of liberty and property. Let it be remembered, that they can sentence to almost unlimited imprisonment, to whipping, to fine, nay, to transportation for
<image src="S2V0018P0I0091"/>
<col>167</col>
seven and fourteen years. I have shuddered to see the way in which these extensive powers are sometimes exercised by a jurisdiction not responsible for its acts. It is said, that the magistracy ought not to be responsible, because it is not paid; but we ought not to forget, that as gold itself may be bought too dear, so may economy; money may be saved at too high a price. Mark the difference of responsibility between the quarter-sessions and one of the superior courts of the kingdom. In the King's-bench, the name of the judge who pronounces the judgment is known, and the venerable magistrate stands before the country in his own proper person, always placed at the bar of public opinion. Here it is Lord Tenterden&#x2014;it is Mr. Justice Bailey, by their names: in the other case, it is merely the quarter-sessions, which, as Swift says, is nobody's name. The individual magistrates composing it are not thought of&#x2014;their names are not even published. It is a fluctuating body. If the same individuals always sat in the court, there might be some approach to responsibility. At present there is none; and where there is no responsibility, injustice will occasionally be committed, as long as men are men. It would be some correction of the evil, if the number of magistrates was fixed; if their names were always known in connexion with their acts; and if they were more easily removable on proof of their misconduct. Then comes the question,&#x2014;is it, after all, gratuitous service? We are told that we cannot visit them severely, or even watch them very strictly, because they volunteer their duty, and receive no remuneration for their trouble. But although they have no money for it, they may have money's worth. Cheap justice, Sir, is a very good thing; but costly justice is much better than cheap injustice. If I saw clearly the means by which the magistrates could be paid, and by which, therefore, a more correct discharge of the magisterial duties might be insured, I would certainly prefer paying them in money to allowing them to receive money's worth by jobs, and other violations of their duty. Not only may the magistrate himself receive compensation as money's worth; he may receive it in hard money by his servants. The fees of a justice's clerk amount to a little income, often to many times a man's wages. I have heard of a reverend justice in the country having a clerk, whose emoluments he wished to in-
<col>168</col>
crease, and therefore he had him appointed surveyor of weights and measures, with a salary of a guinea and a half a week. This person appointed a deputy, to whom he gave five shillings and sixpence, and who did all the duty. These circumstances came under the consideration of his brother justices; when, after a strenuous opposition, and among others, on the part of the gentleman who communicated the occurrence in a letter now lying before me, it was decided, not only not to remove the first appointed person, who it was proved was doing nothing, but to swear in the other as his assistant&#x0021; My friend is not entirely without suspicion that this person, having so small a remuneration as five shillings and sixpence a week, can only have undertaken the duty with a view of increasing it by some understanding with the people whose weights and measures it is his duty to superintend. The operation of pecuniary motives in matters connected with the magistracy is more extensive than may at first sight appear. There was a bill introduced by the right honourable gentleman opposite, for extending the payment of expenses of witnesses and prosecutors out of the county rates. It is not to be doubted that it has greatly increased the number of commitments, and has been the cause of many persons being brought to trial who ought to have been discharged by the magistrates. The habit of committing, from this and other causes, has grievously increased every where of late, and especially of boys. Eighteen hundred odd, many of them mere children, have been committed in the Warwick district during the last seven years. Nor is this a trifling evil. People do not come out of gaol as they went in. A boy may enter the prison-gate merely as a robber of an orchard; he may come out of it "fit for"&#x2014;I will not say "treasons"&#x2014;but certainly "stratagems and spoils." Many are the inducements, independent of any legislative encouragement, to these commitments. The justice thinks he gains credit by them. He has the glory of being commemorated at the assizes before the Lord Judge, and the Sheriff, and the Grand Jury, and all who read the Crown Calendar. On that solemn occasion he has the gratification of hearing it fly from mouth to mouth&#x2014;"He is a monstrous good magistrate; no man commits so many persons." Then there is the lesser glory acquired among neighbours; I into whose pockets they are the means of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0092"/>
<col>169</col>
putting money, by making them prosecutors and witnesses in petty criminal cases; and thus converting (as sir Eardly Wilmot says) their journey of duty into a jaunt of pleasure to the assizes. The reputation of activity is very seducing to a magistrate; but I have known it curiously combined with things more solid than empty praise.&#x2014;In a certain town, which I am well acquainted with, one suburb was peopled by Irishmen and Scots, who were wont to fight on every market time a good deal, at fair tides a good deal more, but without any serious affray taking place. Besides these two classes of the King's subjects, there also dwelt in those parts two justices of the King, assigned to keep the peace; for the better keeping of which, they repaired at the hour of fight to an ale-house, conveniently situated hard by the scene of action, and there took their seat with a punch-bowl full of warrants, ready to fill up. If the Irish happened to be victorious, the Scots came one after another, and applied for commitments, against those who had assaulted them. The despatch, at least with which warrants, if not justice, were administered, was notable. Then came the other party, and swore to as many assaults upon them, and, justice being even-handed, they, too, had their desire gratified; until the bowl was, by degrees, emptied of its paper investment, and a metallic currency, by degrees, took its place.<lb/>
Some of these details may be ludicrous; but the general subject is a most serious and a most important one, because these facts show the manner in which justice is administered to the people out of sight of the public and out of reach of the higher courts of law. It is through the magistracy, more than through any other agency&#x2014;except, indeed, that of the tax-gatherer&#x2014;that the people are brought directly into contact with the government of the country; and this is the measure of justice with which, when they approach it, they are treated by functionaries irresponsible for its proceedings. A justice of the peace, whether in his own parlour or on the bench&#x2014;whether employed in summary convictions, or in enforcing what is called, after a very worthy friend of mine, Mr. Nicholson Calvert's Act (one of the worst in the Statute-book, which I hope to see repealed, and which I trust its excellent author will very long survive,)&#x2014;is never an ostensible individual; responsible in his own proper person, to public opinion hardly ever unless
<col>170</col>
he chooses, by some indiscretion, to make himself so, amenable to a higher and purer judicature. The judges of the land, chosen from the professors of the law, after the labours of a life previously devoted to the acquirement of knowledge calculated to fit them for their office, and clothed with attributes of supreme power over petty magistrates, are responsible for every word and act, and are subject to every species of revision and control. They were selected with the most anxious caution for every qualification of high character and of profound knowledge; and yet they are incapable of pronouncing a single decision, from which an appeal will not lie to some other tribunal immediately above them; while, from the decision of the country justices&#x2014;taken from the community at hazard, or recommended by the habits least calculated to make them just, subject to no personal responsibility, because beyond or below the superintendence of public opinion, and irremovable, unless by a verdict for some indictable offence&#x2014;from their decision there is no appeal; from their decision, although they have to deal with some of the most important interests in the country, there is no appeal, unless their misdeeds shall have been set forth in a case, submitted by their own free will, with their express permission, to the Court of King's Bench.<lb/>
These are the principal points to which, in the first division of my subject, I desire to call the attention of the House, as deserving your deliberate consideration, and as the materials of solemn inquiry. I could have wished to accomplish my object more briefly, but I found it impossible consistently with distinctness; I am not aware that I have made an unnecessary comment; and I must trust to the candour of honourable members, in weighing the importance of these statements, to pardon the apparent prolixity unavoidably incident to the handling of a very extensive and varied argument.<lb/>
II. I wish I could give the House any promise that my speech was approaching its termination; but that hope can hardly be entertained, when I state, that I am now about to enter on the still more vast I and momentous consideration of the laws as administered in those tribunals, whose construction we have been surveying&#x2014;the distribution of justice in those courts I in which it has been my fortune to practise during a pretty long professional life.<lb/>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0093"/>
<col>171</col>
There is a consideration of a general nature, to which I would first of all advert, I mean, the inconvenient differences, in the tenures by which property is held, and the rules by which it is conveyed, and transmitted, in various districts of the country. Is it fitting or consistent with reason, or, indeed, with justice, that merely crossing the river, or travelling a distance of some miles in this neighbourhood, should make so great an alteration in the law of real property, as that, to the eastward of us, all the sons inherit equally; to the westward the youngest alone; and here the eldest; but these rules of the Common-law, of Gavelkind, and of Borough English are better known, and operate with more defined limits. What shall be said of the customary tenures, in a thousand manors, all different from the Common-law that regulates freehold estates, most of them differing from each other? Is it, I ask, fit that this multitude of laws, this variety of codes, the relics of a barbarous age, should be allowed to exist in a country subject to the same general bonds of government? I should trespass at greater length than I am willing to do, were I to detail the various customs which exist in the manors of this country; but to give the House an idea of their diversity, I must mention a few. In one manor, the copyhold property is not allowed to pass by will; in another, it may be so conveyed. I admit that a great improvement has been made in this respect, by the act of an hon. friend of mine, (Mr. M. A. Taylor) to whom we owe several other important legislative measures, allowing it to be devised by will without surrender. This is the only material improvement which has been made with respect to such property, within the last hundred years; but it only operates in facilitating the transmission, according to the custom of the manor, passing the copyhold by will. In one manor, a devise is not valid, if made longer than two years before the testator's decease; so that it is necessary for wills to be renewed every two years; in another one year, in a third three years are the period; while in many there are no such restrictions. In some manors the eldest daughter succeeds to the exclusion of her sisters, as the eldest daughter (in default of male heirs) succeeds to the crown of England; in other manors all the daughters succeed jointly as co-parceners, after the manner of the Common-law. In some
<col>172</col>
manors a wife has her dower, one-third of the tenement, as in case of freehold. In others, she has, for her "<i>free bench</i>," one half; and again, in some, she takes the whole for life to the exclusion of the heir. The fines on death or alienation, vary; the power and manner of entailing or cutting off entails vary; the taking of heriots and lords' services varies. There are as many or more of these local laws than in France, in the <i>Pays de Cout&#x00FB;me</i>, of which I have seen four hundred enumerated, so as to make it the chief opprobrium of the old French law, that it differed in every village. Is it right that such varieties of custom should be allowed to have force in particular districts, contrary to the general law of the land? Is it right, I may also ask, that in London, Bristol, and some other places, the debts due to a man should be subject to execution for what he owes himself, while in all the rest of England there is no such resource; although in Scotland, as in France, this most rational and equitable law is universal?<lb/>
All these local peculiarities augment the obstacles, both to the conveyance and to the improvement of landed estates. They prevent the circulation of property in a great degree, and they lessen the chance that an owner of such tenements would otherwise have of raising money, on their security, adequate to their value. The greater facility of conveyance is nothing set against the ignorance of local custom; and then copyhold property is not liable even for specialty debts, nor can it be extended by elegit; and thus, absurd and unjust as is the law which prevents freehold property from being charged with simple contract debts, it goes further in this instance, and exempts the copyhold from liability, even to those of the highest nature, a judgment itself not giving the creditor any right of execution against it. The obvious remedy to be adopted in this case is, to give all parts of the country the same rules touching property; and, therefore, I would propose an assimilation of the laws affecting real estates, all over England, to take place at a given period, say twenty or thirty years hence, so as to prevent interference with vested interests.<lb/>
Having now, Sir, pointed out some of the varieties of our law in certain districts,&#x2014;its inequalities in respect of place,&#x2014;let us proceed to examine whether it is more uniform and more equal in respect of persons. And here we are met, at the very

outset, with a most fearful exception to the maxim, which describes the law as no respecter of persons. It is commonly said, that the Crown and the subject come into court on equal terms. Lawyers of the present day do not, I am aware, profess this; but that great dealer in panegyric, Mr. Justice Blackstone, has spoken as if the King had no greater advantage in litigation than any of his people. It would have been well if he had stated that this was only a fiction; though he must have been puzzled to prove it, like other fictions, invented for the furtherance of justice. It is true that the law itself makes no such pretensions to impartiality; for of the two classes of manifest inequality which I am about to mention, one is avowedly such, by reason, as it is said, of the prerogative; although the other, just as substantial in reality, is not avowed to be so. I begin with the latter. It is said, that the Crown can no more take my estate than I can another man's; for if I have a claim against the Crown, it is said that I have a remedy, by the decent and respectful mode, as they term it, of a <i>petition de droit</i>, or, in case of a title&#x2014;by matter of record, a <i>monstrans de droit</i>. The same eloquent panegyrist, whom I have mentioned, describing the very name of the process to have arisen from the presumption of the law, that the King can do no wrong, adds, that, from the great excellence ascribed to the Crown, "to know of an injury and to redress it, are one and the same thing&#x2014;therefore, the subject has only to make his grievance known by his petition." From this is drawn the conclusion, that when a subject has a right, he can have the means of defending it with equal facility against the Crown as against any other party. Now, let us see how far this consequence is, in point of fact, realized. The Crown never moves by itself, but through the medium of the King's Attorney-general. No proceeding can be taken against the Crown without the <i>fiat</i> of the Attorney-general; and unless a party obtains that, all his trouble and expense in going to Whitehall, and asking the permission of the Secretary of State, is lost, because all such affairs are referred to the Crown lawyer; and if he should refuse leave, the only remedy left to the subject is the very convenient and practical one of impeaching that officer. It may be said that the Attorney-general would not refuse his <i>fiat</i>, because it is a mere proceeding in the first
<col>174</col>
instance, like suing out an original writ, or a <i>latitat</i>, to bring a cause into the King's-bench; and the Attorney-general here is like the Chancellor or the sealers of the writs elsewhere, who issue writs to any suitor as a matter of course. But I make answer that, although it ought to be so, it is not so. It is in the discretion of the Attorney-general, that is, of your adversary's counsel, to let you bring your action or not as he pleases. Why, I demand, should it be left in the breast of any man to refuse that which another may claim as a right, and as the lowest of all rights, to have his right inquired into by law? To show you how this discretionary power is used, I might say abused, I will mention a case; and, following the rule I prescribed to myself at setting out, it shall be one that has come within my own knowledge professionally. A considerable estate had, in a supposed default of heirs, been granted to a gentleman of great respectability, a friend of mine. After some time another individual set up a claim to it, on the ground of being the heir of the body of the original grantee, the first gift having been in tail male. The case was submitted to me and to a learned friend of mine at the Chancery bar; and we advised that the party should proceed by petition of right. We examined all the cases upon the subject, and deeming this the only mode, we applied to the Attorney-general, and he refused his <i>fiat</i>, giving no better reason than that we ought to have proceeded by ejectment against the; tenant in possession. We preferred our writ of right against the Crown, as all lawyers term the <i>petition de droit</i>. Had the question been with a subject, we might either have proceeded by ejectment to recover possession, or by writ to try the mere right as the higher remedy; and no officer could have shut us out at either door by which we chose to enter the court. Now, I can state conscientiously my opinion, that the case of the individual alluded to was a strong one in statement. It was one of pedigree, and certainly one of the clearest I had seen on paper. I do not mean to assert,&#x2014;for I had no means of ascertaining it,&#x2014;that it was unanswerable. There may have been some gap in the chain, some marriage, or some birth not proved, or some other flaw in the claimant's title; but of that I can form no judgment, because that I was not allowed to try; and this is the hardship of the case&#x2014;the matter of which, I hold, my
<image src="S2V0018P0I0095"/>
<col>175</col>
client had just reason to complain&#x2014;he was not allowed to bring forward his proofs. Then, I ask, is it not a mere mockery in those panegyrists of things as they are, to say that the Crown and the subject stand on equal footing?<lb/>
But the cases in which the same disparity prevails between their rights, avowedly and by the positive sanction of the law, are much more numerous; they are of constant occurrence, too, in practice, and I will, therefore, mention them for the information of those who are not lawyers, and, I believe I may say, of some who are. In the first place, it is the general principle that a demurrer is an admission of the fact in dispute; but this, it is said, does not extend to the Crown, and that, if defeated in this way, it can begin again, and is not concluded. Secondly, it has been decided lately in the Exchequer&#x2014;I was not in the case, but so I have heard, from those who attend that court,&#x2014;that no such thing is allowed as an exception for insufficiency to an answer filed by the Attorney-general on behalf of the Crown. But the subject notoriously enjoys no such privilege; his answer is open to all exceptions; were it not, you must, in suing him, take for an answer just what he chooses to tell you, and he escapes the equitable jurisdiction entirely. Next, (and an instance occurred lately, which I argued in the court of King's-bench, and which was decided against me, without hearing the other side,) wherever a suit is commenced, whether it be in Cumberland, Middlesex, or Cornwall, (and in Cornwall was the case I allude to,) if the Crown has any title which may, however indirectly, come in question, although no party, the proceedings can at once be removed by a mere suggestion, not of record, but on the part of the Attorney-general, stating it from his place in court, and a trial must then be had at bar before the four judges. In this way all the preparations made by the parties are put an end to, and witnesses must be brought to town at an inordinate expense, and under every disadvantage. There is no doubt that an allowance would, in such cases, be made by the Crown, to compensate for this additional cost; but still the party has to pay in the first instance, together with being taken away, as well as his witnesses, from that part of the country in which he and they are known, to the county of Middlesex, where the power of the Crown is more accurately
<col>176</col>
known than the character of the other suitor. When this point was argued, the Court held the prerogative too clear to be discussed. There is a fourth striking advantage which the Crown possesses over any other party. No person can, after the jury is sworn, withdraw a record, but must be non-suited, to avoid a verdict. The Crown has, to my knowledge, withdrawn it, after counsel had been heard, and witnesses examined, and the jury been charged by the judge; I have known the record withdrawn while they were deliberating, and because they were deliberating, which indicated hesitation; and this late retreat is made without the penalty to which any other party would be liable, who had fled before the cause was called on, namely, the costs of the day; for there is another unfairness to justify this course; that as the Crown is supposed above receiving costs, so it is to be exempt also from paying them. But the reason of this I cannot possibly see. I cannot grant that the dignity of the Crown places it above taking costs, when I reflect that by the Crown is here meant the revenue raised from the people for the public service, and that, consequently, the non-payment of costs to the Crown is an increase of the people's burthens. But, even if I could admit the propriety of the Crown's receiving none, it would by no means follow that it should pay none to the subject, who is in a widely different predicament. All this, however, arises out of notions derived from the feudal times, when the Crown was in a situation the very reverse of that in which it stands at present, its income then arising almost entirely from a land revenue. There is now no reason why it should be exempt from paying, or disabled from receiving, in all cases where costs would be due between common persons. Indeed, there has been of late years an exception made in the Crown law on this head, but so as to augment the inequality I complain of. In all Stamp prosecutions, the costs of the Crown are paid by the unsuccessful defendant; so far does it stoop from its former dignity; but not so low as to pay the defendant a farthing of his costs should he be acquitted. The last and the worst part of the history remains; whenever a special jury is summoned in a Crown case, and that all the twelve jurors do not attend, a tales cannot be prayed to let the cause proceed, without a warrant from the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0096"/>
<col>177</col>
Attorney-general: so that it is in the power of your adversary to refuse this at the time it may be most for his advantage so to do; while you have no option whatever in case it should be for his interest to proceed, and for your's to delay. I pray the House will mark attentively what I am now about to relate, although, indeed, I should apologise for thus appealing to them, after the singular patience with which I have been heard throughout, for the great length of time I have already occupied. There was a case in the Court of Exchequer, in which I acted as counsel for the defendant, and had to subject a Crown witness to a severe cross-examination; he exhibited strong indications of perjury, but the verdict went against me notwithstanding. My learned friend, Mr. Serjeant Jones, (whose talent and professional skill entitle him to higher praise than any in my power to bestow,) whether he profited by my experience, or was more dexterous in dealing with the case, did honour to himself by succeeding in the next trial, when the same witness was examined; for the suspicion of perjury entertained before was now turned into certainty, and the party acquitted. A prosecution for perjury was instituted against that man and others connected with him; eighteen indictments were found at the sessions, and the Crown at once removed the whole by <i>certiorari</i> into the Court of King's-bench. There they were all to be tried, and a former Attorney-general conducted the prosecution. On the first, Meade, the witness I have mentioned, was clearly convicted. The other seventeen were then to have been tried, and Mr. Serjeant Jones called them on, but the Crown had made the whole eighteen Special Jury causes: a sufficient number of jurymen did not attend; my learned friend wanted to pray a tales, and the Crown refused a warrant. Thus an expense of ten thousand pounds was incurred, and a hundred witnesses from Yorkshire were brought to London, all for nothing, except, after the vexation, trouble and delay he had endured, to work the ruin of the prosecutor, who had been first harassed upon the testimony of the perjured witness. These poor Yorkshire farmers, whom this villain had so vexed, had no more money to spend in law; all the other prosecutions dropped; Meade obtained a rule for a new trial, but funds were wanting to meet him again, and he
<col>178</col>
escaped. So that public justice was utterly frustrated, as well as the most grievous wrong inflicted upon individuals. Nor did it end here; the poor farmer was fated to lose his life by the transaction. Meade, the false witness, and Law, the farmer whom he had informed against, and who was become the witness against him, lived in the same village; and one evening, in consequence, as was alleged, of some song or madrigal sung by him in the street, this man Meade seized a gun, and shot Law from his house dead upon the spot. He was acquitted of the murder, on the ground of something like provocation, but he was found guilty of manslaughter, and such was the impression of his guilt upon the mind of the court, that he was sentenced to two years imprisonment. A case of more complicated injustice&#x2014;one fraught with more cruel injustice to the parties, I never knew in this country, nor do I conceive that worse can be found in any other. We may talk of our excellent institutions, and excellent they certainly are, though I could wish we were not given to so much Pharasaical praising of them; but if, while others, who do more and talk less, go on improving their laws, we stand still, and suffer all our worst abuses to continue, we shall soon cease to be respected by our neighbours, or to receive any praises save those we are so ready to lavish upon ourselves.<lb/>
i.&#x2014;And now, having thus far cleared the way for examining the proceedings in our courts of justice, the first inquiry that meets us is, by what means unnecessary litigation may be prevented; in other words, suits unjustly and frivolously brought, and wrongfully defended, by oppressive or intemperate parties. I shall here, as under all the other heads of the subject, begin by laying down what I take to be the sound principles of legislation applicable to the point, and then comparing with these the provisions actually adopted by our jurisprudence. The first and most obvious step is, to remove the encouragement given to rich and litigious suitors, by lessening the expense of all legal proceedings; and I would put an end to all harassing and unjust, defences, by encouraging expedition. Next, I would not allow of any action or proceeding which only profits the court and the practitioners, and the object of which is always granted as a mere matter of course; all things should be considered as
<image src="S2V0018P0I0097"/>
<col>179</col>
done at once and for nothing, which may now be done on a simple application to the Court with some delay and expense. Thirdly, no party should be sent to two courts where one is able to afford him his whole remedy; nor to a dear and bad court, when he can elsewhere have a cheaper and a better remedy; nor should any one be obliged to come twice over to the same court for different portions of his remedy, which he might have all in one proceeding. Fourthly, whenever a strong presumption of right appears on the part of a plaintiff, the burthen of disputing his claim should be thrown on the defendant. This I would extend to such cases as bills of exchange, bonds, mortgages, and other such securities. In those cases I think the plaintiff should be allowed to have his judgment, upon due notice given, unless good cause be, in the first instance, shown to the contrary, and security given to prosecute a suit for setting the instrument aside. This is a mode well known in the law of Scotland, and would put an end to all those undefended causes, which are now attended with such great and useless expense, as well as injurious delay to the parties. Fifthly, I would suggest, that in all cases where future suits are to be apprehended, proceeding might be adopted immediately to raise the question, and quiet the title. The law on this head also is very different in the two parts of the island. In England, it is not possible to have the opinion of any Court, until the parties are actually engaged in a lawsuit, opportunities for which may very frequently not occur, until the witnesses to prove a case may be dead, or an infant, or a person living abroad, and incapable of well defending his right, has come into possession. But the Scotch law furnishes a kind of action, the adoption of which may be productive of the greatest benefit, as I have once and again heard lord Eldon hint in the House of Lords. I know very well that here we may file a bill for perpetuating testimony, but there must be an actual vested right in the party instituting the suit: and the proceeding is, besides, so cumbrous, as rarely to be used. The Scotch law, on the contrary, permits a declaratory action to be instituted by the party in possession or expectancy, <i>quia timet</i>, and enables him to make all whose claims he dreads parties, so as to obtain a decision of the question immediately. This is, of course, and very pro-
<col>180</col>
perly, at the expense of him who brings forward the suit for his own interest, unless where a very obvious benefit arises to the other party; for in Scotland they have nothing like our statute of Gloucester, and costs are always in the discretion of the Court, as with us in equity. Sixthly, I would abolish all obsolete proceedings, which serve only as a trap to the unwary, or tools in the hands of litigious and dishonest parties, and lie hid or unheeded until, unexpectedly, they are brought forth to work injustice. For an instance, I will name wager of law, a defence which may be set up in answer to an action of <i>detinue</i>, or of debt on simple contract. This is another of the remains of the old feudal system. The defendant has only to swear that he does not owe the sum of money claimed by the plaintiff, and bring eleven others to swear that they believe him; and a defendant would certainly be badly off if he could not find out so many persons to do this kind office for him, as he needs only bring those who know him, but know nothing at all of the circumstances; for the less they know, the more ready will they be to swear they believe their friend. He has only to place them on opposite sides, at the end of the table, (for the wisdom of past ages hath carefully fixed the stations which the parties are to occupy pending this solemnity,) get them to swear, and there is an end at once of the action. It is true that pleas of this kind are seldom pleaded, though it was done some time ago in the Common Pleas: and the oldest practitioners there, not being acquainted with the plea, were about demurring to it, when it was discovered to be a law wager well pleaded, and a complete good defence in law, though the practice was obsolete.<lb/>
Now, these being the fundamental principles that should guide us on this head, nothing can depart more widely from them than our practice, and nothing can be more easy than making it conform to them. In the first place, without throwing away a thought upon the pain which I should necessarily inflict upon some of my learned friends, much wedded to such lore&#x2014;without caring a rush for the quantity of curious learning which would thus be thrown to waste&#x2014;or dropping a tear over the musty records which must be swept away&#x2014;I would abolish at once the whole doctrine and procedure of Fines and Recoveries. I hope I may not offend the ears
<image src="S2V0018P0I0098"/>
<col>181</col>
of my respected brethren the conveyancers; but I may say, that if ever there was an absurdity not to be tolerated, it is those fictitious suits at any time, but above all, in the present state of society.<lb/>
I wish to make myself understood, for I see by the countenances of some gentlemen, that they do not quite comprehend the whole absurdity of the law respecting fines and recoveries. I do not by any means wish to interfere with the power of making, or of barring entails: I consider the English law as hitting very happily the just medium between too great strictness and too great latitude, in the disposition of landed property; sufficient restraints upon perpetuities, upon endless settlements, are provided, to allow a free commerce in land, as far as that is consistent with the interests of agriculture, and the exigencies of our mixed constitution; while as much power is given of annexing estates to families, as may prevent a minute division of property, and preserve the aristocratic branch of the government. With the substance of our law of entail, then, I have no wish to meddle; all I desire is, to abolish the ridiculous machinery by which fines are levied and recoveries suffered. Every gentleman knows, that if he has an estate in fee he can sell it, or bestow it in any way he may please; but if he has an estate tail, to which he succeeds in the long vacation, he can go, on the first day of Michaelmas term, and levy a fine, which destroys the expectant rights of the issue in tail; or he may, by means of a recovery, get rid of those rights and all remainders over. He can thus, by going through certain mere forms, make himself absolute master of his estate, and do with it as he pleases. But this must be done through the Court of Common Pleas, at certain seasons of the year. And why should there exist a necessity for going there? Why not, if it be necessary, pay the fines which are due, without going there at all? I, the other day, asked this question of some learned friends,&#x2014;why force tenants in tail into court, for mere form sake? They laughed at my simplicity, and said, "All this was asked a hundred years ago; there is no necessity for the proceeding, only to keep up the payment of the King's silver, alienation fines, and other duties." In case of bankruptcy, the necessity for those forms is not felt. A trader who is tenant in tail commits an act of bankruptcy, and
<col>182</col>
by the assignment under the commission not only the interest vested in him is conveyed, but all remainders expectant upon it are destroyed, for the benefit of his creditors, and the estate passes to his assignees free from all restriction. The courts have held, as indeed the Bankrupt Laws evidently intended,<sup>*</sup> the conveyance in bankruptcy to be a statutary barring of I the entail&#x2014;an enlarger of the estate tail I to a fee. Now, I would do that for honest landowners, which the law at present permits to be done for tradesmen and their creditors. So, too, a man and his wife cannot convey an estate of the wife without a fine or a recovery, neither can the wife be barred of her dower without a similar proceeding. The reason is, the influence her husband may possess over her mind; and, consequently, a judge takes the woman, in these cases, into a private room, to examine her, first, as to whether she acts from fear, and then, when that is out of the case, whether she is influenced by favour and affection; and he also examines her, as to any temporary increase of affection from any passing cause; and then, when she has purged herself of all increase of affection from any passing cause, of all fear, and all love, she is allowed to give her consent. Now I would propose, in place of all this inquiry, not always very delicate, nor even very satisfactory, to let husband and wife join in common conveyance, with the consent of a guardian, to be appointed, or of the next male relative of the wife, who is not related to the husband, and not interested in either the succession or the conveyance.<lb/>
Now there is certainly nothing very real in a Fine; but as to Recoveries, I ask, do those persons who seem to hold by them, know at all what they avowedly proceed upon? They go upon the ground of compensation in value being made to the remainder man, whose right they cut off, and who, but for this fictitious suit, would have a title to take the estate after the
<quote><sup>*</sup> Of the bar to remainders in tail there can be no doubt; but there are decisions which lean against, the operation of the Bankruptcy, to bar the remainders over, contrary to Blackstone's decided opinion, (2 <i>Com</i>. 286. 361.) and it should seem to the plain intent of the legislature. See <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Clarke,</i> 5 <i>B. A.</i> 458, and <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Tayleure</i>, 3 <i>B, A.</i> 557.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0099"/>
<col>183</col>
tenant-in, tail's-decease. He is said to recover a compensation in value; and from whom does he get it? Why, the common vouchee, who is the crier of the Court of Common Pleas, and who, like the man at the Custom-house, obliged to take all the oaths other people do not like, lies groaning under the weight of all the liabilities he has incurred to every remainder man, since he became crier, and answerable for the millions of property in remainder, the rights to which have been barred, he not being worth a shilling. Locke says, that a madman is one who reasons rightly from wrong premises; so it is with the lawyers on recoveries, who argue very ingeniously, and even soundly and consistently, on the principle of the compensation, and whose conclusions could in no wise be impeached, if you once allowed the fact, that those in the remainder are compensated by the proceedings. Indeed, it happened to myself, not long ago, in a case, where a very large estate was in question, to argue, and to prevail, respecting the effect of a recovery, on this very ground of compensation in value. I there had to contend, that the claimant was barred by the recovery, in consequence of the compensation received from the vouchee, though it was quite certain that, from the vouchee, there never was, nor ever could be, received a single shilling. My argument, on that occasion, did not excite a smile in the court, because the principles of the law were known to be thus established, and the consequences were of serious import, be the premises ever so ludicrous. But, were I to use the same argument elsewhere, it would, if understood, be received with much less gravity. Put an end, then, to all such ridiculous forms, which have no earthly use but to raise a little money by way of fees; and which, beside creating expense and delay, and oftentimes preventing tenants in tail from passing their property by will, which they cannot if they die before suffering the recovery, give rise to a number of questions in law, often very puzzling, always dilatory and costly&#x2014;not rarely to mistakes in fact; as where I knew an estate go to the tenant in tail in remainder, instead of the recoveree's heir-at-law or devisee, which he fully intended it should, merely because in suffering the recovery an omission was made of one parcel.<lb/>
Sir, I also, would put an end to those
<col>184</col>
imaginary trusts made in settlements for the purpose of preserving contingent remainders. It has been said, that some Members of this House, who, during the Commonwealth, retired to the country and employed themselves in conveyancing, invented those refinements which characterize what are called strict settlements. I repeat, that my object is not to touch the principle of the law of entails, as it now exists in this country; believing that owners of estates should not be laid under greater restrictions than they now are in disposing of them by will after their death, or by settlement upon marriages in their families. But let the purpose of the owner be accomplished more simply and more easily than can now be done. I would allow every man to settle or to devise his property to A during his life, and after him to B and C in succession, making by plain words so many life estates, and giving a fee to the person who, by our present law, takes the first estate tail, not allowing him to have any power over the property until it became vested in possession, but requiring that, in order to affect it while in expectancy, he and the tenant for life should join in some simple conveyance, as a feoffment, where-by the settlement might be carried on. The property then would not be alienable an hour sooner than it now is, and it would be alienable without fine or recovery;&#x2014;and I would make the act, which the law now deems a discontinuance, as a feoffment in fee by tenant for life, absolutely void to all purposes, instead of making it a forfeiture of the particular estate of the feoffor though void as a conveyance; so that I would get rid of the necessity of trustees being interposed to save the contingent uses from destruction.<lb/>
Again, I would restore the Statute of Uses to what it was clearly intended to be. Our ancestors made that law, by which if land were given to A for the use of B, the latter was deemed the legal owner, the use being executed in him, just as if A did not exist. It was justly observed by Lord Hardwicke, that all the pains taken by this famous law, ended in the adding of three words to a conveyance. This has been said by conveyancers to be a severe remark,<sup>*</sup> but it is perfectly
<quote><sup>*</sup> Some have questioned its authenticity, as not to be found in a MS. note of Hopkins <i>v</i>, Hopkins&#x2014;but the words are</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0100"/>
<col>185</col>
correct; for the Courts of Equity invented second uses or trusts, by holding with the Courts of Law, that the statute did not apply to land given to A to the use of B, in trust for C; that it executed the use only in B, but not in C; therefore, the whole provision is evaded, by making the gift "To <i>the use of</i> B in trust for C;" and these three words send the whole matter into Chancery, contrary to the plain intent of the statute. It was also held, that copyhold estates are not within the statute in any way, and there are other nice exceptions, but not much better grounded. Can there be any reason whatever for not making all such estates legal at once, and restoring them to the jurisdiction of the common law, by recognizing, as the owner, the person to whom in reality the estate is given, and passing over him who is a mere nominal party?<lb/>
Another deviation from the principles I have laid down, and a great source of multiplicity of suits, is the law with respect to agreements for sales, leases, and other conveyances. Thus, if I agree with a person to give him a lease, though he, under the agreement, becomes my tenant, he is my equitable tenant only, but not my legal tenant. He may be possessed of a written agreement, signed and sealed, for a lease of ten years, and may occupy under it, but he has no lease which a Court of Law can take notice of; and if an ejectment is brought, he must go out. He may go into a Court of Equity on his agreement, if that is any comfort to him; he may apply for a decree against me to perform my agreement, but till then his claims are not recognised in a Court of Common Law. If an injunction be brought, the expenses are further multiplied. Why, I ask, should not the agreement, such as I have described, be as good as a lease; when, in substance, it is the very same thing, and only wants a word added or left out to make it the same in legal effect too? A case illustrative of this subject,
<quote>far too remarkable to have been inserted:&#x2014;"By this means a statute made upon great consideration, introduced in a solemn and pompous manner, by this strict construction has had no other effect than to add at most three words to a conveyance."&#x2014;I Atk. 591. The remark nearly in the same words is adopted by Blackstone, who cites lord Hardwicke in confirmation of it.&#x2014;2 Com. 336.</quote>
<col>186</col>
happened to come within my own observation. I was counsel in a case, at York, where an agreement had been entered into and possession given; but because it did not contain words of present demise, it was no lease, and, therefore, the tenant could not stand a moment against the ejectment that was brought, but was driven into the Court of Chancery, where the other party could just as little stand against him. How much inconvenience, expense, and delay, then, might be saved, if such an agreement were pronounced equivalent to a lease; and, in general, every thing were supposed done in one court, which may be ordered as a matter of course to be done by another, reserving, no doubt, all objections on the head of fraud, mistake, surprise, and the like, which may be raised by pleading at law, just as easily as in equity.<lb/>
In like manner, I would allow a legatee to sue an executor or administrator for his legacy, and the mortgagor to sue for his rights. It is always said, that in these and the like cases of active trusts, accounts must be taken; and so they must in every action where there is a matter of set-off against a demand. The old action of account might be greatly improved; and by its aid, and by reference to arbitration, where necessary, much that now goes to equity might be disposed of at law. The only reason why such cases as these, where the assets are to be marshalled, and cross claims considered, now go into the Court of Chancery, is, not for any superior fitness of that Court itself, but because of its appendages, the Masters' Office, without which it would be no better than the King's-bench to manage even long trusts, <i>chronic cases</i>, as they have been termed, (though every suit in Equity might be thus named). Let the Court of King's-bench have an equal number of Masters&#x2014;let Arbitrators be publicly appointed, to whom parties may refer before any expense has been incurred, as they do now after all the bill has been run up&#x2014;nay, to whom they may go without even consulting an attorney&#x2014;and if this machinery be found not enough effectually and properly to despatch the business of the Court, let its machinery be increased, and sure I am it would be the cheapest and most powerful that ever was set up. It would do away with the ridiculous importance attached to a few words of conveyance;&#x2014;it would oust the jurisdiction of the Court of Chan-

cery in all the matters of which I have been speaking, and which it has from time to time drawn over from the Common Law, to which those matters originally belonged. Then the Courts of Equity would be left to execute their ordinary jurisdiction in matters of account requiring a long course of time, and minute and daily attention&#x2014;cases calling not for decision, but superintendence,&#x2014;to the care of infants, idiots, and insolvent estates, and other matters which it would be impossible for a Court of Common Law effectually to take cognizance of.<lb/>
Again, on the same principle of avoiding multiplicity of suits, why, in ejectments, should two processes be requisite to give the plaintiff his remedy? As things now stand, after a man has succeeded in one action to establish his title to the possession, he must have recourse to another, to recover that which he ought to have obtained by one and the same verdict that established his title&#x2014;the mesne profits? Why could not the same jury settle the matter at once? Why is an individual driven to maintain two actions for the purpose of obtaining one and the same remedy? Or why should not the jury that tries the right, also assess the damages? Mr. Tennyson's bill, which was intended to remedy some part of this evil, is only permissive; it ought to have been compulsory. It is only recommendatory, and its recommendations are not always attended to, because the lawyers, having the choice, do not think fit to pursue that which is the least profitable; they choose the two actions, when one would suffice for the interests of justice&#x2014;for the interests of the plaintiff and defendant&#x2014;for all interests, except those of the practitioners.<lb/>
ii.&#x2014;Having now considered how the number of needless suits may be diminished, I proceed to the next head of my inquiry&#x2014;to ascertain how, after their number is reduced as low as possible, and those only brought into Court which ought to be tried, you may best shorten the suits brought, by disposing of them in the shortest time, and with the least expense. And this topic leads me to examine the principles which ought to be adopted for encouraging the parties to come to an amicable settlement as speedily as possible. The law cites as its warrant for certain steps in every suit, the injunction of Scripture&#x2014;"Agree with thy adversary
<col>188</col>
quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing." The latter part of the text is applicable enough to the proceedings under the English law, and this scriptural advice to compromise ought to be constantly set before the eyes of suitors in all our courts with the penalty denounced. Our law, however, no sooner adopts the principle by allowing a party to imparl, than it departs from the spirit of it; for it must be observed, that the delay of imparlance is admissible, not "in the way," but in the Court, after arrest, and when the effect is only to produce unnecessary loss of time, and fees as unnecessary. Here, however, the sound principles are as obvious as before. Whatever brings the parties to their senses as soon as possible, especially by giving each a clear view of his chance of success or failure, and, above all things, making him well acquainted with his adversary's case at the earliest possible moment, will always be for the interests of justice, of the parties themselves, and indeed, of all but the practitioners. It is the practitioners generally, that determine how the matter shall proceed, and it may be imagined that their own interests are not the last attended to. The seeming interest of two parties disposed to be litigious, in many cases appears to be different from the interests of justice, although their real interest, if strictly examined, will not unfrequently be found to be the same. Now, justice is embarrassed by the disingenuousness of conflicting parties; justice wants the cases of both to be fully and early stated; but both parties take care to inform each other as little as possible, and as late as possible, of their respective merits. One tells as much of his case as he thinks good for the furtherance of his claim, and the frustration of the enemy's&#x2014;so does the other, only as much of his answer as may help him, without aiding his adversary; and the judge is oftentimes left to guess at the: truth in the trick and conflict of the two. The interest of the Court of Justice being to make both parties come out with the whole of their case as early as possible, the law should never lend itself to their concealments. This remark extends to the proof
<image src="S2V0018P0I0102"/>
<col>189</col>
as well as the statement of the case; an intimation of what the evidence is may often stop a cause at once. In Scotland, the law in this respect is better than ours, for no man can produce a written instrument on trial without having previously shown it to his adversary. For want of this salutary rule I have often seen the most useless litigation protracted for the sole benefit of practitioners. I was myself lately engaged in a cause, the circumstances of which will give the House an idea of the mischief. I was instructed not to show a certain receipt to the opposite party, as my client, the defendant, meant to nonsuit his adversary in great style, as he would call it. Well, the plaintiff, (an executor), stated his case, and called his witnesses to prove the debt. I did not take the trouble to cross-examine, which would have been quite unnecessary. Equally so was it to address the jury. I acknowledged the truth of all that had been sworn on the other side, but added that it was all useless, as I happened to have a receipt for the money, which had been paid to the testator. This, of course, put an end to the case. The sum sought to be recovered did not exceed twenty pounds, and the expenses could not have been less than a hundred. If that action had been brought in Scotland, it never could have come to trial, nor, indeed, been prosecuted beyond the mere demand: for, this receipt being shown, the claim would have been abandoned. Here some person or other, I will not say who, had an interest in the cause being suffered to proceed, and the law enabled him to accomplish his object. I think, Sir, the adoption of some such rule as the Scotch might be desirable. At least, it would be well to inquire how it acts in Scotland, and be guided by the result.<lb/>
Next, the greatest encouragement should be given to compromises in all cases. At present the law recognises the principle to a certain extent, and permits money to be paid into Court, in some instances, as cases of contract and quasi-contract, where the damages are certain. But nothing can be less judicious than restricting the power of paying money into Court, to those classes of causes, and excluding actions upon contract with uncertain damages, and actions upon tort, which are far more likely to be brought hastily or obstinately defended, because they
<col>190</col>
are accompanied by irritated feelings<sup>*</sup> The earliest opportunity should be afforded in all cases to each party of getting rid of the suit on receiving or making compensation. I would, therefore, extend the right of paying into Court, or tending amends, to all cases whatever. As the law now stands, it is only magistrates, officers, and other persons specially protected by the statutes of James 1st and George 2nd who can thus proceed in actions for injury offered to the person or property.<lb/>
But the great means of shortening litigation are to be found in an enlargement of our law of arbitrament. I much fear that this, my next proposal, may seem strange, especially as coming from a professional man&#x2014;for it goes directly to abridge the length and the expense of law proceedings in a great number of cases, and of preventing not a few from ever coming into Court. But it is calculated to secure justice effectually, without which no saving of expense or of time deserves the name of an improvement. Now, I do not lay claim to any peculiar disinterestedness in broaching this matter. Few persons, it is true, have less interest in diminishing the amount of business in our Courts, because there are not many who gain more by it, and to whom, therefore, the abuses which I am describing, if such they be, are more profitable. But I really believe that lopping off needless litigation, by measures calculated to lessen the expense of procedure in all its branches, would greatly increase the number of lawsuits&#x2014;real suits, which ought to be encouraged, as necessary to justice, but which at present are kept out of Court, by the double tax of cost and delay. The County Courts ought to be diligently reformed&#x2014;their process extended to matters of a larger amount, and of greater variety&#x2014;their officers rendered more able and effective. This improvement of itself would greatly diminish

the number of trifling suits brought into the higher judicatures; and how can I, or any one conversant with the practice of the law, adequately express the benefits of having a speedy and cheap redress for petty wrongs, when we daily witness the evils of the opposite system&#x0021; How often have I been able to trace bankruptcies and insolvencies to some lawsuit about ten or fifteen pounds, the costs of which have mounted up to large sums, and been the beginning of embarrassment. Nay, how often have we seen men in the situation described by Dean Swift, who represents Gulliver's father as mined by gaining a Chancery suit, with costs&#x0021; The public generally, are little aware of the number of petty actions forming the bulk of every cause paper at <i>Nisi Prius</i>. Professional men can tell how many now stand for trial concerning demands under twenty pounds; how few of these have been thus far ripened by the fostering care of the profession and the offices, under a hundred pounds expense. I made the Prothonotary, four years ago, at Lancaster, give me a list of fifty verdicts obtained at the Lent assizes; the average was under fourteen pounds, including, however, two or three actions brought to try rights, where the damages were of course nominal. But if the money recovered amounted in all to less than nine hundred pounds, the costs incurred certainly exceeded five thousand pounds: fifty pounds a side being indeed a very low average of costs as between attorney and client. It is not too much to affirm that not above a tenth part of those fifty cases would ever have seen the Court at Lancaster had a right system prevailed; that is, if the parties who were to bear the heavy charge, whether of losing or seeming to gain (for the loss, generally speaking, only differed in degree) had been early apprized of their real situation and exercised their own judgment upon the question of going on or settling betimes. An extension and improvement of arbitration is one of the remedies I have ventured to suggest, at least for further discussion. If arbitrators were publicly appointed, before whom parties themselves might go in the first instance, state their grounds of contention, and hear the calm opinion of able and judicious men, upon their own statements, their anger would often be cooled, and their confidence abated, so as to do each other justice without any expense or delay. Such a tribu-
<col>192</col>
nal exists in France, under the name of <i>Cour de Conciliation</i>; in Denmark it exists; and for certain mercantile causes in Holland also. If it be thought too great a change to introduce it here, in what I deem its best form, I think much good would arise from a modification of it&#x2014;the appointment of public arbitrators, who might at all times sit and take references by consent, with process to compel the attendance of witnesses, and the execution of their awards. At least we should see all those cases taken before them at once, which are now brought at great cost into Courts wholly unable to try them, and are uniformly greeted with the observation from both bench and bar&#x2014;"Oh an account and a set-off&#x2014;a hundred items&#x2014;so many issues&#x2014;no judge or jury can try it," after all the expense of trying it has been incurred.<sup>*</sup><lb/>
iii.&#x2014;The course of our inquiry has thus brought us, in the third place to the commencement of a suit; and here the principles and rules which present themselves are as obvious as they are important. The first is to prevent the debtor's escape, and hinder him from delaying his creditor, by wilfully absenting himself. The second is to give the debtor due notice of the particular nature of the claim, so that he may defend himself if right, or yield if wrong, that is, if actually indebted. The third is, to give the debtor no unnecessary inconvenience, till found to be in the wrong, (that is, indebted), as far as is consistent with due security to the plaintiff against a defendant likely to escape; taking care also to protect the defendant against a plaintiff likely to oppress him with costs and leave him without remedy on dropping the suit. Now, against all these, which I consider cardinal virtues in this importtant stage of procedure, our laws offend most grievously; for, in the first place, we assume the defendant to be in the wrong, and not only so, but to be meditating flight from his country and his home; we therefore, arrest him immediately, and cast

him into prison or compel him to find bail. A Member of this Honourable House, if, by the acceptance of an office, he happens, for the space of a few days, to be out of Parliament, may thus be arrested, and put to the most serious inconvenience. It might have happened the other day to the member for Oxford. If he bought twenty pounds' worth of goods on a Saturday; went to his villa and returned on Monday, on knocking at his door he might be met with an arrest, and he must then accompany the sheriff's officer to a lock-up house till he procured bail. He would then do what I understand is usual in such cases, send for his butcher and his baker, and get bailed; but a gentleman could not, after that, complain so well of the meat or bread, or the bills during the next half year. Certainly he would not be in a situation, the week after, to criticise his tradesman's conduct with a good grace. I have known worse inconvenience happen from such use being made of the law, at elections; indeed, when candidates have carried their adversary's voters to Norway, instead of letting them reach Berwick, we may believe they would not scruple to use the writ for a similar purpose. But however malicious or spiteful may be the motives of any one in so employing the process of the law, there being a probable cause of detention, and the process not being abused, no action lies against the wrong doer. If he have no accomplices, so as to fall within the charge of conspiracy, he is safe. To the wealthy, however, all these inconveniences are trivial; but how does such a proceeding operate on a poor man, or a tradesman in moderate circumstances? He has no facilities for obtaining bail; if he does, he pays one way or another afterwards for the favour; and if he cannot procure it he must go to prison. Perhaps no man ever holds up his head, or is the same man again, after having once been in prison, unless for a political offence. But, I ask, why should a man ever be arrested on mesne process at all? The honourable member for Montrose has brought this subject before the House, and he has my hearty thanks for it. On what ground of common sense does our law in this matter rest? Why should it be supposed that a man, owing twenty pounds, will leave his house, his wife, his children, his country, his pursuits; and incur voluntarily the punishment awarded for great crimes, by banishing himself for life?
<col>194</col>
Yet the law always proceeds on the supposition, that a man will run away the moment he has notice given him of an action for the debt. Some men might possibly act thus, but their conduct forms the exception, not the rule; and do you legislate wisely&#x2014;do you legislate like men of sense&#x2014;do you legislate with common consistency&#x2014;when you denounce a penalty against all men, in order to meet a case not likely to occur once in a thousand times?<lb/>
What would be the effect of altering the law in this respect? Could its reformation injure anyone? Certainly not; on the contrary, it would benefit all classes of the community. The very first consequence of such an alteration would be to make tradesmen less easy in giving credit, by rendering them more cautious. At present, they are induced to rely on the suddenness of personal arrest for compelling a payment of their demands, in preference to others, and thus to speculate upon the chance of payment from insolvent persons; so they enter into a competition&#x2014;not an honest, praiseworthy competition, in the correctness of their dealings, or the goodness of their wares&#x2014;but a competition in the credit they give to needy and profligate, or suspected and extravagant men, unable to pay any thing like the whole amount of debts, which the rashness or cupidity of tradesmen may allow them to contract. And on whom does the loss thus incurred by the tradesman finally fall? Not unfrequently on those who can and do pay; they have to answer for those who do not; they pay a sort of <i>del credere</i> in proportion to the loss incurred through giving credit&#x2014;a species of insurance on all bad debts. Even the more respectable customers would be all the more regular in their dealings and economical in their habits, were they never tempted by easy credits to buy what they have not money to pay for.<lb/>
My next objection to the present system under this head is, that no proceeding can take place in our courts unless there be an actual appearance. We outlaw a man to compel an appearance. Why do so? Why can we not proceed as in a case of ejectment, where a notice is left at the dwelling-house? Why can we not leave a writ at a man's house, stating what we sue him for; and only when we think him about to fly, call upon him to give surety? I repeat, why not send a writ to the known, domicile or house of business of the debtor; a writ, too, which shall plainly describe
<image src="S2V0018P0I0105"/>
<col>195</col>
the cause of action, instead of serving him with a writ that only tells him he is a prisoner for some reason or other, which in due time he will be informed of: and, if he cannot be found, outlawing him after nine months' delay? This is done in Holland, a mercantile country, and in Sotland, a wary country, where too great charity is not generally shown to the debtor; at least the Scotch have not the reputation of being unnecessarily merciful on such occasions; yet a writ to take the debtor's person is only obtainable there if he be in <i>meditatione fug&#x0153;</i>. Our process of outlawry is, in its nature, extremely foolish; its object being to compel an appearance, which, after all, is not necessary, provided he wilfully absents himself after due notice. If a man chooses to keep away, why not proceed without him after such a delay, and so many services at his place of residence as shall ensure him having a knowledge of the action? As for any scruple about proceeding against an absent man, without making perfectly sure of his having notice, the present law has no right to say a word on the subject; for its process of outlawry is neither more nor less than a mean by which you harass an absent man, without even pretending to give him notice. He may be in the Greek Islands, on the coast of Africa, or in the back woods of America, and his creditor can outlaw him, and proceed to have his goods forfeited without his being aware of the transaction, and without the proceeds of the forfeiture necessarily benefiting any one but the Crown. In Exchequer cases, it is true, the debt and costs, not exceeding 50<i>l</i>. are paid out of the fund arising from selling the goods; in all other cases a party must apply to the Lords of the Treasury. Why should this be? What have the Lords of the Treasury to do with the legal remedy of plaintiffs in suits? Why send any one to the executive power for the redress which the judicial authority alone ought to administer?<lb/>
iv.&#x2014;We are now to suppose the parties in Court, and called upon to state their cases, the claim of one, and defence of the other. Anciently this <i>pleading</i>, as it is termed, was by word of mouth; but in more modern times it has been carried on in writing. Originally, too, pleas were in French, afterwards in Latin, and, for a century past, by a great, but most salutary innovation, doubtless much reviled and dreaded in its day, they have been con-
<col>196</col>
ducted in English. I must own that I approach the subject of Special Pleading, in the presence of my most worthy friend and learned instructor in that art, (Sir N. C. Tindal,) with some degree of awe. That excellent person's attainments in its mysteries are well known, and justly appreciated. He is intimately acquainted with the subject. The distrust of my own learning therein, while addressing him, is not lessened by my recollection of the praises lavished upon it by high authorities of past times. Lord Coke deemed it so delightful a science, that its very name was derived, according to him, from its; pleasurable nature: "Quia bene placitare omnibus placet." Incapable of inventing a new pleasure, I would fain restore a lost one, by bringing back pleading to somewhat of its pristine state, when it gave our; ancestors such exquisite recreation. Certain it is, that our deviations from the old rules in this branch of the law has been attended with evil effects. Those rules, as Lord Mansfield once said, were founded in reason and good sense; accuracy and; justice were their object, and in the details much of ingenuity and subtlety was displayed; but by degrees the good sense has disappeared, and the I ingenuity and subtlety have increased beyond measure, and been oftentimes misdirected; nay, to such a pitch have the changes proceeded, that at last subtlety has superseded sense; accuracy and justice are well nigh lost sight of, and ingenuity is exhausted in devising pretexts for prolixity and means of stratagem. In these really hurtful innovations the courts of law have been the far too ready accomplices: and the legislature has been a most willing instrument, to increase the evil, by sanctioning, almost as a matter of course, in each new act, the power of pleading the general issue; so that to call the modern practice by the name of <i>special</i> pleading is an abuse of terms. It can be only restored to its ancient condition, and made deserving, if not of Lord Coke's panegyric, yet of the more measured commendations of Lord Mansfield, by reviewing the entire system as it at present stands. My wish is, as far as possible, to revive the accuracy of the old pleading, without its niceties and verbosity; while pains are taken to improve it where this can safely be done, by adapting it to the advanced state of modern jurisprudence.<lb/>
The precedents of the ancient pleaders,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0106"/>
<col>197</col>
and the other rules recognized in their times, furnish the most valuable materials for this reform; and, indeed, it is chiefly from the science as they left it that the principles I am about to state are drawn. The first great rule of pleading should be to induce and compel the litigant parties to disclose fully and distinctly the real nature of their respective contentions, whether claim or defence, as early as possible. The second is, that no needless impediment should be thrown in the way of either party, in any stage of the discussion within the Court, whether plea, replication, or rejoinder, whereby he may be hindered to propound his case in point of fact, or of law. In the third place, all needless repetitions, and, generally, all prolixity should, as well as all mere reasoning, which neither simply affirms nor denies any proposition of fact or of law, be prevented; and all repugnant or inconsistent pleas should be disallowed. That these were the principles on which the ancient pleaders bottomed their system entirely, I will not affirm; but upon them it was mainly built; and I regret to say, that the last century and a half has witnessed great and prejudicial alterations in the original plan: so that the record, instead of exhibiting a plain view of what each party is prepared to prove, in the great majority of cases, contains an endless multitude of words, from which, if the real matter in dispute can be gathered at all, it is only by guess work, or by communications out of the record relating to things, of which it gives not even a hint. Let us look into this a little more narrowly. The count of a declaration should convey information as to the subject of the action; but it conveys no precise knowledge of the plaintiff's demand, or of indeed what the suit is about. Take the instance of the Common Counts, as they are justly termed, being those constantly resorted to; and take the most common of these, the count for money had and received. I will take no advantage of the audience I speak before, being unacquainted with legal niceties, in order to make merry with the venerable formalities of the art. All lawyers know how easy it would be in this place to raise a smile, at the least, by recounting the little fooleries of our draftsmen; but I disdain it; and will treat the subject precisely as if I were addressing professional men. The plaintiff declares, that the
defendant, be-
<col>198</col>
ing indebted to him for so much money had and received to the use of the said plaintiff, to wit, one thousand pounds, undertook and faithfully promised to pay it but broke his engagement; and the count is thus framed, the self-same terms being invariably used, whatever be the cause of action which can be brought into Court under this head. Now, observe how various the matters are which may be all described by the foregoing words. In the first place, such is the declaration for money paid by one individual to another, for the use and benefit of the plaintiff"; this is what alone the words of the count imply, but to express this they are rarely, indeed, made use of. Secondly, The selfsame terms are used on suing for money received on a consideration that fails, and used in the same way to describe all the endless variety of cases which can occur of such failure, as an estate sold with a bad title, and a deposit paid; a horse sold with a concealed unsoundness, and so forth. Thirdly, The same words are used when it is wished to recover money paid under a mistake of fact. Fourthly, To recover money paid by one person to a stakeholder, in consideration of an illegal contract made with another person<sup>*</sup>. Fifthly, Money paid to revenue officers for releasing the goods illegally detained, of the person paying&#x2020;. Sixthly, To try the right to any office, instead of bringing an assize &#x2021;. Seventhly, To try the liability of the landlord for rates levied on his tenant. What intimation, then, does such a declaration give? It is impossible, on reading this count, to say which of the seven causes of action has arisen; and it is not merely those seven, for each one of them has a vast number of varieties, which are declared on in the same words. In actions of trover the case is even worse. Suppose the case of a plaintiff suing for any chattel, as a gun, the declaration will be such as may apply equally to at least eight different heads, under each of which are many different causes of action. The words in all would be the very same&#x2014;that the plaintiff' was possessed of a gun, as of his own proper goods and chattels; that he accidentally lost it; that the defendant found it, and converted it to his use. Now this count describes only one case, that of a gun lost by its owner, and detained by the finder. But
<quote><sup>*</sup> 1 B. and P. 3. lb. 296 &#x2020; 4 T. R. 485. &#x2021; Str. 747. Carth. 95. 1 T. R. 255.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0107"/>
<col>199</col>
it is employed to mean: secondly, That the gun has been taken by the defendant, under pretence of some title, or in any way not felonious. Thirdly, That it was deposited with the defendant, who refused to deliver it up. Fourthly, That it was stopped in transitu, the price not having been paid. Fifthly, That the plaintiff is the assignee of a bankrupt, and seeks to recover the gun, as having been sold after the bankruptcy of the vendor. Sixthly, That the plaintiff has been improperly made a bankrupt, and sues the assignees to try the bankruptcy. Seventhly That his goods have been unlawfully taken, and he sues to try the validity of an execution, on any of the various grounds of fraud, &amp;c. which impeach the validity of the process. Eighthly. That the gun has been misdelivered, or detained by a warehouseman or carrier. All those causes of action differ from each other as much as different things can differ; and yet they are all stated in the declaration the same way, and signified under the same form of words.<lb/>
The pleadings in cases where it might be expected that the greatest particularity would be given to the statement, actions upon torts to the person, are somewhat, but for the most part, not remarkably more definite and precise in their description. The declarations on the seduction of a wife, servant, or daughter, assault, and false imprisonment, are drawn so that you can say, no doubt, what the action is about, which, you hardly ever can in cases of assumpsit or trover; but the same form of words is used, whatever the particular shape of the cause may be. Of the circumstances peculiar to the transaction the pleadings tell the defendant nothing&#x2014;they tell the counsel nothing&#x2014;they tell the judge nothing. It may be said, that the defendant must know the cause of action himself; but that does not always follow, especially if (which may be presumed barely possible, though it seems never to be thought so) the allegations are groundless. There is, however, one person who must know the cause of action, and that is the plaintiff. He ought, for the satisfaction of all concerned, to state it distinctly. The same may be said of the counts in trespass, for taking goods. In trespass <i>quare clausum fregit</i>, perhaps, the description of the wrong done is more specific. But it happens that the circumstances here are of far less importance; damages are not in question; a shilling or
<col>200</col>
so is to be recovered, the object of the action being almost always to try a right of property or an easement. In all other cases of trespass, where a knowledge of the wrong suffered is most material, the parties are left to fight, and the Court to decide, in the dark; but in the case I have just alluded to, where a knowledge of the circumstances in which the trespass was committed is immaterial, every thing is told to them of which it is wholly unimportant that they should be informed; in a cumbrous way, no doubt, and with much fanciful statement, but still it is told. Actions for slander and libel, for malicious prosecutions, and malicious arrest, or holding to bail, with others on the case, are very particular, and form certainly, an exception to the ordinary course of pleading; at least, as far as the declaration goes; no further, as we shall presently see&#x2014;for I now proceed to the next stage of the pleadings; namely, to the pleas which the defendant puts upon the record in answer to the plaintiff's complaints.<lb/>
In this stage of the cause we encounter the same evils, but in greater abundance; for they affect those actions on the case where the count is most precise. Generally speaking, it may be said, that if the plaintiff tell us nothing in his declaration, the defendant, in return, tells us as little in his plea; in that respect, at least, they are even. This is, perhaps, a consequence of the former evil; but, be that as it may, it ought to be remedied. The plaintiff ought to tell the defendant the real nature of his complaint, and the defendant ought to make him equally acquainted with the nature of his answer. If this were always done, perjury would not so often be committed; every thing intended to be proved would be stated on each side, and the parties, knowing the evidence on which the respective statements must be established, would have an opportunity of examining into the character of the witnesses, and of procuring the best evidence to elucidate the point. At present, the mystery of pleading leaves them in doubt; and the vague and indistinct statements on the record, unaccompanied by other information, open a door to the entrance of falsehood in the witnesses, far wider than any you could open, by enabling them to get up proofs in answer to those expected from the opposite side. Whenever the parties fight each other by trick, on the record in the first instance, fencing to evade telling
<image src="S2V0018P0I0108"/>
<col>201</col>
their grounds of contention, they renew the fight afterwards by perjury in Court. I will now give the House some instances of the vagueness of this part of pleading.<lb/>
In the <i>indebitatus assumpsit</i>, from which I took my first example, the general issue is <i>non assumpsit</i>. Now, under that plea no less than eight different defences may be set up; as, for instance, a denial of the contract, payment, usury, gaming, infancy, accord and satisfaction, release, and coverture. All these defences are entirely different, and yet they are all stated in the self-same words. So, too, in the action of trover; take our former case of the gun: the defendant, under the plea of "not guilty," may set up as a defence, that he is a gamekeeper, and took it by virtue of the statute of Charles II<sup>*</sup>; or that he had a lien upon it, as a carrier for his general balance, and had, therefore, a right to detain it; or a particular lien for work done upon it; or that he had received it as a deposit, and was entitled to keep it; or that he took it for toll&#x2020;, or detained it till passage money due by its owner were paid&#x2021; or the reward due for saving it from shipwreck &#x00A7;. Any one of these defences may be concealed under the plea of "not guilty," without the possibility of the plaintiff discovering which it is that his adversary means to set up; so that every body will, I think, agree with me, that if the count teaches the Court and opposite party little, the plea teaches them not a whit more.<lb/>
It is of these things that Mr. Justice Blackstone must be speaking, when he thus eloquently closes his account of special pleading and actions (not otherwise remarkable for accuracy&#x00B6; with a merited panegyric upon that perfection which it shares in his eyes with all the rest of our system.&#x2014;"This <i>care and circumspection</i> in the law, in providing that no man's right shall be affected by any legal proceeding <i>without giving him previous notice</i>, and yet that the debtor shall not, by receiving such notice, take occasion to escape from justice; in requiring that <i>every complaint be accurately and precisely ascertained in writing</i>, and be as <i>pointedly</i>

The inconsistency of many of our rules of pleading for his the next head of complaint to which I shall direct your attention, and it is just as manifest as the vagueness and indistinctness I have been pointing out. Why are infancy and coverture to be given in evidence under the general issue, while other defences of a similar description must be pleaded specially, as the statute of limitations always, and leave and licence in trespass? If it is right that specific defences, of which your general plea gives your opponent no notice, should be couched under that plea, why should you be compelled to give notice of other averments before suffered to prove them? Why do you, in one case, multiply pleas, which, in the other, your own practice declares to be unnecessary? One or other course, the vague or the precise, the prolix or the concise, may be fitting; both cannot be right. Nay, there is often an option given as to the same thing; infancy, coverture, release, accord and satisfaction, and others, may either be given under the general issue in assumpsit, or pleaded. Why, this choice amounts to no rule at all&#x0021; If a ground of defence is ever to be pleaded specially, why not always?<lb/>
A-kin to this inconsistency of principle is the variety of repugnant counts and pleas allowed in all cases whatever. Where there are ten different ways of stating a defence, and all of them are employed, it is hardly possible that any three of them can be true; at the same time their variety tends to prevent both the opposite party and the Court from knowing the real question to be tried. Yet this practice is ge-
<quote><sup>*</sup> 3 Com. 423,</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0109"/>
<col>203</col>
nerally resorted to, because neither party knows accurately what course his opponent may take; each, therefore, throws his drag-net over the whole ground, in hopes to avail himself of every thing which cannot escape through his meshes. Take the case of debt on bond. The first plea in such an action, almost as a matter of course, is the general issue, <i>non est factum</i>, whereby the defendant denies that it is his deed; the second as usually is, <i>solvit ad diem</i>&#x2014;he paid it on the day mentioned in the bond, a circumstance not very likely to happen, if it be not his deed; the third is <i>solvit post diem</i>&#x2014;he paid it after the day; a thing equally unlikely to happen, if it be not his bond, or if he paid it when due; and a fourth often is, a general release. What can a plaintiff learn from a statement in which the defendant first asserts that he never executed the deed, and next, that he not only executed it, but has moreover paid it off? Where pleas are consistent with each other, it may be well to let them be pleaded in unlimited abundance: where they are not only not consistent, but absolutely destructive of each other, it would be a good rule to establish that such pleas should not be put together upon the record, at least without some previous discussion, and leave obtained. The grounds of action are often stated with almost as great inconsistency&#x2014;almost always with greater multiplicity in the declaration. I recollect that at York, many years ago, it was my duty, as junior counsel, to open the pleadings in an action brought upon a wager which had been laid upon the life of the Emperor Napoleon. I stated to the jury in the usual way, that the defendant, in consideration of one hundred guineas, agreed to pay the plaintiff a guineas a-day during the life of one Napoleon Buonaparte, and so forth, alleging the breach. Thus far all was well, and the audience were not disturbed; but there was not much gravity among them, when I went on to state the second count, averring another wager on the life of "one other Napoleon Buonaparte"&#x2014;and, indeed, though one in those days was quite enough for the rest of the world, two did not satisfy the pleader, who made mention of a third and a fourth Napoleon.<lb/>
I know that it is frequently said these allegations deceive nobody, and their vagueness and repugnancy keep no one in the dark, for each party contrives to have
<col>204</col>
a good guess of what his adversary means. That this is not the case in many instances I know; that it takes place more frequently than might be expected, I am ready to admit. But what vindication is this of the system? If any thing like precise information is obtained in such cases as I have described, it is most assuredly not from the record, but in spite of the record; it is by travelling out of it&#x2014;by seeking elsewhere for what the record does not give, or for correcting the false impression which it conveys; consequently, this defence of pleading is the very humble one, that it is useless, and, were it not for the cost, would be harmless.<lb/>
Before the statute of the 4th of Anne, no man was 'allowed to plead double; the plaintiff might have as many ways of stating his case as he pleased, but to each count the defendant could only give one answer. By that statute he may, with leave of the Court, plead two or more distinct matters. Though that leave was formerly granted or refused at the discretion of the Court, it is now regularly given as a matter of course. There is, however, a fee to be paid to the office for it, and also a fee to counsel for signing the rule to obtain it, which, of course, implies a charge by the attorney also. I believe every practitioner is fully aware of the consequences. Beside the expense, the utterly needless expense, the mischief of it is great and undeniable. I believe in my conscience, that many an attorney's clerk, who afterwards proceeds to still greater frauds, begins his career of crime by stopping this fee to counsel on its way. It is not necessary that the barrister should sign his name; and a knowledge of that, fact among attornies' clerks and barristers' clerks seduces into a course of petty embezzlement, which leads to larger peculations in the long run, and ends in all the dishonesty which marks the life of the disreputable practitioner. According to the principles before laid down, such rules as I this, to plead double, and all others of the kind, ought at once to be abolished, and the parties allowed to do, without any application, or rather supposed application, to the Judge, and without any expense, what they thus obtain for the mere payment of money. But to proceed: though the defendant may plead, the plaintiff cannot reply many matters. For instance, in <i>indebitatus assumpsit</i>, if the defendant pleads, first, that he never made any
<image src="S2V0018P0I0110"/>
<col>205</col>
promise, and next, that he was an infant when he made the promise, the plaintiff must either admit the infancy, and set up a subsequent promise, or deny the infancy altogether, and re-affirm the original promise; for he cannot both deny the infancy and set up a subsequent promise. Now, I will ask the House, why, if the defendant may plead several matters, the plaintiff should not reply several matters? There must be some limit, I allow, set to the replication, otherwise, at each stage of the pleading, there would be a multiplication of issues, like the puzzle of the nails in a horse-shoe; but, surely, there can be no harm in allowing each separate ground of defence to be met both by a denial and an answer; giving the plaintiff a general replication to make the defendant prove his plea, and one special replication; I mean, as long as you allow the defendant to multiply, without restraint, his grounds of defence; for the power of pleading repugnant pleas being restricted, there will be the less prolixity occasioned by enlarging the power of replying.<lb/>
The restriction upon demurrer, or pleading to raise an issue in law, appears still less founded in principle. By demurring, a party is obliged to confess the facts to be true as stated by the opposite party, and confine himself to a denial that, by law, those facts warrant the inference against him to raise which they are stated. If I am alleged to have made a particular promise, I may deny that I made it, which would raise a direct issue on the fact: or I may say that, though I did make it, such a promise is not binding in law, which raises an issue on the law. These two denials, however, cannot both be given; I must take my choice, either to admit the law or the fact. How is this in common life? If I am charged with any thing wrong, as using certain blameable expressions, I may deny the words altogether, but may add, "admit, for argument sake, I did utter them, they were wholly harmless&#x2014;wholly free from the meaning affixed to them." In truth, men are demurring all day long, when they are conflicting or disputing with one another, and no one ever dreamt of tying down his antagonist to an admission of the fact, because he had argued against the inference. If any thing can make the rule more objectionable, it is the gross inconsistency which it exhibits to the last rule I mentioned, the permission given to a defendant to raise as
<col>206</col>
many repugnant issues of fact as he pleases. Why should a party be allowed to say, "In point of fact, I deny the promise; but, if I made it, six years have elapsed&#x2014;or I made it underage," and be prohibited from saying&#x2014;"In point of fact I deny the promise; but, if I made it, there was nothing binding in point of law?" The two defences, as far as their duplicity goes, are precisely similar; and as it must be allowed that, before double pleading was introduced, the restriction upon demurring was consistent with the general principles of the system, so, if repugnant pleas were forbidden, the objection, in respect of consistency, to a demurrer admitting the facts pleaded, would be removed. On other grounds, however, it would still be quite wrong. I admit that part of the mischief occasioned by the rule may be remedied after verdict, the objection being on the record. But beside that this remedy cannot, in every case, be applied, there has been the delay and expense, to say nothing of the absurdity of a trial of facts, which, if proved, amount to nothing. Why should not the Court first determine the disputed law, and then, only if it becomes necessary, try the truth of the facts?<lb/>
A very great, amendment of the law would be, to permit, all formal errors to be amended, even at the very last stage of the cause. No one should be turned round on a mere variance; no one should be defeated on a mere verbal mistake, as it was my lot to be lately in an indictment, the history of which will aptly enough introduce this head of remark. It was a prosecution for perjury: the jury was sworn, the case was opened, witnesses were examined, and documents read, when a variance was discovered between the affidavit, on which the perjury was assigned, and the copy of it which formed part of the record: in the one the word "grandmother" was used: in the record the syllable "grand" was omitted, and only the two last syllables "mother" were inserted. This was, of course, fatal to the indictment. There can be no doubt that the perjury, which consisted in the denial of a payment, was equally committed, whether that supposed payment was made to the mother or the grandmother; yet, owing to this utterly unimportant error, all the trouble of the Court, and all the expense of the prosecutor, were rendered perfectly useless, and the ends
<image src="S2V0018P0I0111"/>
<col>207</col>
of public justice frustrated. In ninety-nine cases out of every hundred&#x2014;indeed, I might say, in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of every thousand&#x2014;in which parties are turned round upon variances, the materiality is not greater than in that which I have just mentioned to the House. The improvement which I would suggest is to allow nobody to be turned round upon a variance, except at the discretion of the Judge. Where it is clear that the record by its variance from the evidence has deceived the party, then the discrepancy ought to be fatal; but because this may happen once in a thousand times, ought we to legislate upon the exception, and introduce a general system of quirks and niceties upon sorry trifles&#x2014;the greatest opprobrium of the law? Furthermore, I would allow no failure of a case from the want of a sufficient stamp being affixed to any instrument used in evidence. In a case which occurred not long since, my Lord Dudley was turned round, because it was said there were a few words more in the instrument than we had counted, and the stamp was some half-crown below the amount required. At the trial of the cause, it was not disputed by us, that the words were more in number than the stamp covered; we took for granted that our adversary had reckoned right, and we did not require the process of addition to be gone through in Court; it was afterwards found out that the defendant had counted the words wrong, and that they fell short of the number mentioned in the Stamp Act. The plaintiff, in consequence, got a rule for a new trial. But suppose we had been wrong and he right, what difference would that have made in the justice of the cause, which was truly an undefended one? I would allow the judge to inflict a penalty of 20<i>l</i>., of 50<i>l</i>., if necessary, to protect the revenue, instead of 10<i>l</i>. for the want of a stamp; but I would not allow the party to be turned round, and to lose his trial, because he had got a wrong stamp, or no stamp at all, affixed to his agreement or deed.<lb/>
Let not the House suppose that grievances, such as I have been describing to flow naturally from the present system, are imaginary and theoretical. I can assure the House, from my own daily experience, that they are not: they produce constantly a cost or a delay, amounting to the positive denial of justice. To give an illustration of some of the parts of the
<col>208</col>
system in its workings, I shall read the letter which I hold in my hand, from an eminent practitioner in the law. The widow of a Welsh clergyman was obliged to bring an action upon a mortgage-deed for the payment of the mortgage-money and interest, and for performance of the covenants in the deed. She might have foreclosed by a proceeding in equity; but preferring the delays of the King's-bench to those of the Chancery, she brought an action of debt of the simplest possible kind, both in its nature, and in the form of the proceedings; and the House shall now hear from her solicitor himself, what was the progress and termination of that action.&#x2014;"The defendant was a Member of Parliament, and some delay, as is usual with such defendants,"&#x2014;(I beg pardon, Sir&#x2014;of course I am not answerable for the terms of the letter)&#x2014;"took place in enforcing an appearance. When the declaration was delivered, the defendant demanded oyer of the bond, and that obtained, made as many applications as the Judge would allow for further time to plead. At the expiration of this period, he pleaded&#x2014;1st, <i>Non est factum&#x2014;</i> 2nd, <i>Solvit ad diem&#x2014;</i>3rd, <i>Solvit ante diem<sup>*</sup>&#x2014;</i>4th, <i>Solvit post diem&#x2014;</i>5th, Performances. It is needless to add, all these pleas were pure legal fictions. The plaintiffs, in their replication, took issue on such pleas as concluded to the contrary, and assigned breaches of the condition, according to the statute. The breaches assigned were, non-payment of the principal&#x2014;non-payment of the interest&#x2014;and non-performance of the covenants of the
<quote><sup>*</sup> Had the plaintiff's pleader chose, the law enabled him to demur to this plea (but it would have increased the delay and served the defendant's purpose.) The ground of the doctrine, that paying before the debt falls due is no answer to the action seems not very intelligible but it is now settled law.&#x2014;The reason assigned (in Cross v. Tryon&#x2014;though there are cases contra, Cro. Eliz. 143, Dyer 222 and see 14 Ann, c. 16. &#x00A7; 12.) is that if the verdict on that issue goes for the plaintiff, it by no means follows that he has a right to recover, for he may have been paid at or after the day. But so it may be said of a plea of infancy&#x2014;or, indeed, of <i>solvit ad diem</i> itself&#x2014;for though the verdict negative that plea, <i>non constat</i> that there may not have been duress or a release. The true test of a plea (or an affirmative issue tendered at any stage of the pleadings) plainly is this&#x2014;if its being found for him who pleads it decides the matter in his favour, it is good&#x2014;if not, bad.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0112"/>
<col>209</col>
mortgaged-deed. The defendant, for the purpose of splitting the second into two issues, and thereby creating the delay of an issue in law, to be tried before the court <i>in banco</i>, and an issue in fact, to be afterwards tried at <i>Nisi Prius</i> before a jury, demurred to the last assignment of breaches&#x2014;a sham demurrer for delay. The plaintiffs joined in demurrer, and made up and delivered the paper-book and demurrer-book. The defendant, in order to entitle himself to bring a writ of error for delay, without giving bail, then suffered judgment to go by default, for not returning the paper and demurrer-book. The consequence of this was, that all the pleas, replications, rejoinders and demurrer, became useless, and were struck out of the record; and the plaintiffs had to execute a writ of inquiry before the chief justice, under the statute of William III. to assess damages on the breaches suggested. But these proceedings had answered the purpose of harassing the poor defendant with useless and expensive litigation, swelling the pleadings from five folios to one hundred and eighteen; and they had already accomplished much delay, having occupied four terms: the bill was filed in Trinity Term, the pleas and replication in Michaelmas Term, the demurrer and joinder in Hilary Term, and the final judgment was obtained in Easter Term. The defendant then brought a writ of error, without the slightest pretence of actual errror; and that proceeding, of course, delayed the plaintiffs four terms longer. All this was necessarily attended with expense, grievous to a poor person, as the party in this case was. The costs of the judgment were taxed at 80<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>., and the costs in error at 19<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>., making together 99<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>. for the costs, and two years for the delay in <i>an undefended action</i>, in which the length of the declarations was five folios&#x0021; Comment on such a case would be a waste of words."&#x2014;It would indeed&#x0021; But if it be wanted, Blackstone shall be the commentator. "So tender and circumspect," saith he, "is the law of England in providing that no man's right shall be affected by any legal proceeding; in requiring that every complaint be accurately and precisely ascertained in writing, and be as pointedly and exactly answered; in clearly stating the law and the fact; in deliberately resolving the former and indisputably fixing the latter by a dilligent trial; in correcting such errors as may have arisen in
<col>210</col>
either decision, and in finally enforcing the judgment, when nothing can be alleged to impeach it&#x0021; So anxious it is to maintain and restore to every individual the enjoyment of his civil rights, without intrenching upon those of any other individual in the nation,&#x2014;so parentally solicitous is our whole legal constitution to preserve that spirit of equal liberty, which is the singular felicity of the British nation."<lb/>
I must now tell the House, that besides the 99<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>. taxed costs, this poor widow had to pay 30<i>l</i>. for extra costs, which she never received a shilling of from the defendant, and which she had to defray after he had handed his share of the costs over to the plaintiff's attorney. In prosecuting an undefended cause she paid this sum, and if it had so chanced that the defendant, instead of being merely a distressed man, (for I happen to know the gentleman in question, and that though a distressed he is not an oppressive man) if he had been such a character as was once known in the northern provinces, and as we have had represented on the scene,&#x2014;pertinacious, litigious, grasping, oppressive, with a long purse to back him in defending acts of injustice and cruelty,&#x2014;he would have resisted at every stage of the action by counsel and witnesses; he would have had the demurrer argued before the Court; he would have tried the issue at Nisi Prius; he would have carried his Writ of Error through the Exchequer Chamber into the House of Lords; and then the extra costs, instead of 30<i>l</i>., would have amounted to I dare not say what sum, knowing that costs to the amount of 500<i>l</i>. have been incurred to recover a debt of 19<i>l</i>. "So tender is the law of England in providing that no man's right should be affected by any legal proceeding&#x2014;so parental its solicitude to maintain and restore to every individual the enjoyment of his civil rights, without intrenching upon those of any other person whatsoever."<lb/>
Sir, after Mr. Justice Blackstone had written his beautiful and, in part, profound Commentaries, there occurred a case, which he published himself in his Reports, and which must, I conclude, have happened after the panegyrics were composed. I marvel much, however, that, when a subsequent edition of his Commentaries appeared, he did not correct the error into which he must then have been convinced that he had been betrayed, by his
<image src="S2V0018P0I0113"/>
<col>211</col>
excessive admiration for the forms and technicalities of our common law. The case, as reported by himself, was, in substance, this:&#x2014;A gentleman of the name of Robinson, in Yorkshire, was minded to try the resources of the law in an action of trespass against some poor men, who lived near him. In the course of it, reference was made to the Master, to report by whose fault the pleadings in the action had extended to a most enormous and unprecedented length. The Master reported, that in the declaration there were five counts; that twenty-seven several pleas of justification were pleaded by the defendants, which, with replications, traverses, new assignments, and other muniments of pleading, amounted at length to a paper book of near two thousand sheets. He was of opinion that the fault lay principally in the length and intricacy of the declaration, the action being only brought to try whether the freeholders and copyholders of the manor of Ellerton, in Yorkshire, whereof Mr. Luke Robinson was lord, were entitled to common in a ground called the Inclosure. He likewise reported, that the declaration was so catching, by ringing changes upon the several defendants, and the several names of the ground, that it was necessary for the defendants to guard every loophole; which made their pleas so various and so long, especially as Mr. Robinson had declared, that he had drawn the declaration in this manner "on purpose to catch the defendants, and that he would scourge them with a rod of iron." The Court was very indignant at this abuse of the technicalities of the law, and the reporter says, that Mr. Robinson appeared <i>in propria persona</i>, to show cause against this report, "no other counsel caring to be employed for him." The Court ordered Mr. Sergeant Hewitt and Mr. Winn to settle an issue, which they did in a quarter of an hour, and in the space of a quarter sheet of paper, instead of two thousand folios. Talk of scourging with a rod of iron&#x0021; Why should he think of it? The lash of parchment, which is applied to all suitors in our courts of law&#x2014;that flapper, which keeps them awake to the course of justice by the expense and anxiety it inflicts, that truly parental corrector of human errors, manufactured in the engines of practice and pleading, which, pretending to enlighten, serve only to keep the Court and the suitors in the dark as to what they are
<col>212</col>
conflicting about, and oftentimes teach them nothing certain, but that they are ruined, and cannot tell how&#x0021;&#x2014;this parchment lash was a far more safe as well as powerful scourge for the rich and crafty lawyer, and a far more deadly one for his poor and simple antagonists, than any rod of iron which he could have obtained in Colebrookdale.<lb/>
v.&#x2014;The parties being now supposed at issue by the result of their pleadings, the facts in dispute are to be tried by a jury through the medium of Evidence, and the comments of the counsel and judge. Before I enter, therefore, on the head of Evidence and Proceedings, or Trial generally, the House will permit me to say a few words upon the subject of Juries, the rather because this venerable institution has, I lament to say, been of late years, attacked by some of the most distinguished legal reformers. Speaking from experience, and experience alone, as a practical lawyer, I must aver, that I consider the method of Juries a most wholesome, wise, and almost perfect invention, for the purposes of judicial inquiry. In the first place, it controls the Judge, who might, not only in political cases, have a prejudice against one party, or a leaning towards another, but might also, in cases not avowedly political, where some chord of political feeling is unexpectedly struck, if left supreme, show a bias respecting suitors, or, what is as detrimental to justice, their counsel or attornies. In the second place, it supplies that knowledge of the world, and that sympathy with its tastes and feelings, which Judges seldom possess, and which, from their habits and station in society, it is not decent that they should possess, in a large measure, upon all subjects. In the third place, what individual can so well weigh conflicting evidence, as twelve men indifferently chosen from the middle classes of the community, of various habits, characters, prejudices, and ability? The number and variety of the persons are eminently calculated to secure a sound conclusion upon the opposing evidence of witnesses or of circumstances. Lastly, what individual can so well assess the amount of damages which a plaintiff ought to recover for any injury he has received? How can a Judge decide half so well as an intelligent Jury, whether he should recover as a compensation for an assault fifty pounds or a hundred pounds damages?&#x2014;
<image src="S2V0018P0I0114"/>
<col>213</col>
or for the seduction of his wife or daughter, fifteen hundred, or two thousand, or five thousand pounds damages? The system is above all praise&#x2014;it looks well in theory, and works well in practice&#x2014;it wants only one thing to render it perfect&#x2014;namely, that it should be applied to those cases from which the practice in equity has excluded it; and that improvement would be best, effected by drawing back to it the cases which the courts of equity have taken from the common law, and which they constantly evince their incapacity to deal with, by sending issues to be tried whenever any difficulty occurs.<lb/>
I shall not press this subject further, for I begin to feel that I shall be exhausted with the labour I have undertaken, and I fear that your patience may be exhausted with my strength. I will, therefore, proceed to the great subject of Evidence; and, first of all, we are met by the question. Ought the testimony of the Parties to be excluded? The strong opinion expressed by some great authorities on this head requires that, before entering on the Law of Evidence, we should touch the fundamental rule which draws so broad a line between parties and witnesses. It is clear that the law on this head requires revising; it is not so clear that the reform will be best accomplished by receiving every one's testimony in his own cause. The friend of exclusion proceeds upon the supposition, that the situation of a party differs wholly from that of another person; whereas it only differs in the degree of the bias arising out of interest, from the situation of many who are every day allowed to depose. He also maintains that it is dangerous to receive the party's evidence, because of the temptation afforded to perjury. That there is much in this argument, I admit; but, speaking from my own observation, I should say that there is more risk of rash swearing, than of actual perjury&#x2014;of the party becoming zealous and obstinate, and seeing things in false colours, or shutting his eyes to the truth, and recollecting imperfectly, or not at all, when his passions are roused by litigation. I shall not easily forget a case in which a gentleman of large fortune appeared before an able arbitrator, now filling an eminent judicial place, on some dispute of his own, arising out of an election. It was my lot to cross-examine him. I had got a great number of letters in a pile under my hand, but concealed
<col>214</col>
from him by a desk. He was very eager to be heard in his own cause. I put the question to him: "Did you never say so and so?" His answer was distinct and ready,&#x2014;"Never." I repeated the question in various forms, and with more particularity, and lie repeated his answers, till he had denied most pointedly all he had ever written on the matter in controversy. This passed before the rule of evidence laid down by the Judges in the Queen's case; consequently I could examine him without putting the letters into his hand. I then removed the desk, and said, "Do you see what is now under my hand?" pointing to about fifty of his letters. "I advise you to pause before you repeat your answer to the general question, whether or not all you have sworn is correct." He rejected my advice, and not without indignation. Now, those letters of his contained matter in direct contradiction to all he had sworn. I do not say that he perjured himself,&#x2014;far from it. I do not, believe that he intentionally swore, what was false; he only forgot what he had written some time before. Nevertheless he had committed himself, and was in my client's power. I said, "My advice is, that you pay the whole demand before to-morrow." This only increased his anger; he "scorned the offer and the imputation." Turning to his solicitor, I asked if he concurred in his client's view of my proposition. "Very far from it," was the answer. The meeting broke up, the arbitration terminated, and the money was paid the next, morning. Now, had this trial occurred in an open court, the gentleman would have been ruined for ever; he would have had no opportunity of explaining, nay, all explanation would have been useless; if he had escaped prosecution, he would have been suspected of perjury ever after, when all that he was guilty of was too much eagerness, too much impetuosity, and a little wrong-headedness, arising from confidence in his own cause, and a desire to defeat, his adversary. But this anecdote is fruitful in Platter of reflection. On the one hand, we see the risks of admitting impure or uncertain evidence, and the probability of receiving wrong impressions respecting a witness's bias while undergoing the question; on the other hand, we perceive, that it, to a certain degree, the same consequences flow from our present practice of allowing such evidence in some
<image src="S2V0018P0I0115"/>
<col>215</col>
cases, and not in all. Our system is clearly inconsistent in this particular. At least we ought to be uniform in our practice. Why refuse to allow a party in a cause to be examined before a Jury, when you allow him to swear in his own behalf in your Courts of Equity, in your Ecclesiastical Courts, and even in the mass of business decided by Common Law Judges on affidavit? Why is the rule reversed on passing from one side of Westminster Hall to the other, as if the laws of our nature had been changed during the transit; so that no party being ever allowed before a Jury to utter a syllable in his own cause, in all cases before an Equity Judge parties are fully sworn to the merits of their own cause? If it be said, that there is no cross-examination here, I answer, that this is a very good argument to show the inefficacy of Equity proceedings for extracting truth from defendants, but no reason for following a different rule in the two jurisdictions. Indeed, the inconsistencies of our system in this respect almost pass comprehension. All pleas at law are pleaded without any restriction upon their falsehood; in Equity the defendant answers under the sanction of an oath. But Equity is as inconsistent with itself as it is different from Common Law; for the plaintiff may aver as freely as he pleases, without any oath or any risk at all. When an inquiry is instituted into these things, I do venture to hope that something will be done to diminish the number of matters decided on affidavit. This is, indeed, a fruitful parent of fraud and perjury, and not only a great departure from the principle which excludes the testimonies of parties, but an abuse of all principle; for he who would allow such testimony, under due restraints, may very naturally argue, that suffering men to swear for themselves without being exposed to cross-examination must lead to endless equivocation, suppression of truth, and all the moral guilt, without the danger, of actual perjury. If it be right to exclude the parties from giving evidence in their own behalf in one case, it is not right to admit them to give evidence in others; and more especially is it absurd to admit them where they have the power of deceiving with impunity, and exclude them where they would swear under checks and restraints.<lb/>
The first matter that presents itself to my attention, when I come to the subject
<col>216</col>
of evidence, is the great question (intimately connected with what I have been discussing,) how far interest should disqualify a witness. The ancient doctrine upon this point has, of late years, been so much restricted by our Courts of Law, so little is left of the principle on which this objection to incompetency rested, that, for my own part, I will confess I cannot see any adequate reason why all witnesses of good fame, that is, all not convicted of an infamous offence, should not be admitted, leaving the question of their credibility, and the weight of their testimony, to the consideration of the jury. In the case of "Bent <i>v</i>. Baker," an action against one underwriter of a policy, the Court held that another underwriter of the same policy was a competent witness for the defendant, because the verdict could not be evidence in an action against himself, although it was clear that the first action must, in fact, decide both claims. After that decision it cannot be said, that there is any rational ground for exclusion on account of interest in the event, any more than interest in the question. The rule thus established has ever since been followed; and now, in all cases, a person is competent, whatever bias he may have from interest, provided the verdict against him cannot be given for him in another cause; the bias under which he swears being only a circumstance that goes to his credit. After this it is in vain to exclude any evidence upon the ground of interest in the event, and the principle should be extended to all interest direct or indirect. For let the House look at the inconsistency of the present system. If I have the most distant interest, even the interest of a shilling, in reversion on an estate of 50,000<i>l</i>. a year, I am incompetent to give evidence on any point affecting that estate; but suppose I have a father, ninety years of age, lunatic, bedridden, at the point of death, and quite incapable of doing any legal act whatever; that he is in possession of an estate in fee-simple; that I expect to be his heir; or that he had formerly made a valid will in my favour, so that nothing can prevent me from succeeding the moment he dies,&#x2014;I may be a witness to give him the estate,&#x2014;I am competent to swear into the possession of my father a property of 50,000<i>l</i>. a year, to which, in the common course of events, I must myself succeed in a few months. But pecuniary interest
<image src="S2V0018P0I0116"/>
<col>217</col>
is not the only feeling that biasses the mind of a witness; and yet any one may swear for a parent, a brother, a sister, a child, on questions most nearly affecting the peace, and honour, and happiness of the whole family. I therefore think that a line ought to be drawn, not between one sort of interest and another, but between competency and credit; and that all should be admitted to give evidence, leaving it to the jury to determine what dependence may be placed upon their testimony. This is rendered the more fit by the nature of the shifts resorted to for the purpose of restoring the competency of interested witnesses; I allude, of course, to that notable expedient, a release of all actions or causes of action. When a witness has an interest, if he is deprived of it by a release, there is no objection to his competency. Evidence is thus often cooked up for the Court, nay, in the Court, while the witness is in the box, which, according to the existing rules, is not admissible, without such a process. Now, what is the real effect of the release on the mind of the witness? Just nothing&#x2014;for if he be an honourable man he gives it up the moment he leaves the box, and while swearing he knows that he is to do so; so that, the operation being performed upon him adds a pound to the year's revenue, nothing to the credit of his testimony.<lb/>
With regard to written evidence, I must say that it appears to be no less capriciously required than dispensed with. I think as highly as any lawyer ever did of the Statute of Frauds; I would go the full length of the learned judge who said, that every line in it was worthy a subsidy; and it is, therefore, that I could wish a few lines might be added, so as to increase the number of subsidies at which I may value it. First, I would extend the number of cases in which written evidence is exacted. The French law requires that all contracts for sums above one hundred and fifty francs should be reduced into writing, and even authenticated by notarial forms. I would adopt some such extension of our statute; and as almost all men are able to write at the present day, I do not think this would occasion any inconvenience. But then the outlets should be stopt up, by which the exigency of the statute is escaped. I think, as far as I can discern from reading the French Code Civile, and the Conferences upon it, (a wonderful
<col>218</col>
monument of Napoleon's genius, as well as of the talents of his councillors,) that no part performance takes a case out of the French enactment. With us the things are so numerous which take cases out of the Statute of Frauds, that the memorandum in writing is only in a small proportion of cases required. Hence, among other consequences, much subtlety of construction&#x2014;often needlessly extended by jurisconsult exercitations, as the distinction between crops growing and severed, or a right and an easement, in determining what is an interest in land<sup>*</sup>. A judicious enactment, restoring the force of the Statute in these particulars, as well as extending it to other cases, would be highly beneficial in preventing fraud, forgery, and litigation, and could offer no impediment to commerce, further than the beneficial one of narrowing the credit given by small tradesmen.<lb/>
The rule by which a man's books are let in or excluded after his decease, is also, in my mind, extremely defective. They are evidence, if he has entered the receipt of sums by which he makes himself chargeable to any amount. If he only debits himself with the receipt of 5<i>l</i>. which very likely he may have received, he makes his books evidence for his representatives, who may gain 500<i>l</i>. to which he never was entitled. The ground on which they ought to be excluded is, the general probability of their having been made for the purpose of creating evidence; but that probability is never weighed at all in the particular instance. We had much discussion of this matter in the case of Barker <i>v</i>. Wray, beford Lord Eldon, who appeared exceedingly to question the soundness of the received rule; this at least was certainly the impression of the bar. Would it not be better to abolish the legal presumption, exceedingly ill-founded in fact, which lets in all such documents generally, and as generally excludes all others, and to substitute in its place the rule, that any deceased person's books or memorandums may be received, provided it appear that they were not prepared with a view of making evidence for
<quote><sup>*</sup> Thus a license for any number of years to stack coals on a close is not within the statute; this complete occupation of every inch of the surface, and exclusive of all other use of it, even by way of easements, is not held to be an interest in land. There is a case to this effect in Sayers's Reports.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0117"/>
<col>219</col>
his successors, but plainly <i>alio intuitu</i>? Observe, too, that in one case we admit, without any qualification, the books of a predecessor, in his successor's behalf. I mean entries made by a deceased rector or vicar of the receipt of tithes, which are always admitted as evidence for succeeding incumbents, because he is supposed to have had no interest in mis-stating the fact&#x2014;as if the clergy were always entirely free from a corporation spirit.<lb/>
Than as to the rules for the examination of witnesses, I am of opinion that nothing can be better, generally speaking. Every facility is afforded to counsel for extracting the truth. Upon this important head, therefore, my remarks will be few. There is a want of uniformity in the practice of the judges towards counsel engaged in examination. Some will not allow them to cross-examine a witness whom they have called themselves, even though he is stated when produced to be a hostile one; and others will not allow them to put a leading question to an adversary's witness, in cross-examination, if he be really friendly to them. The sound rule seems to be that it depends on the connexions and demeanour of the witness, whether he shall be regarded as the witness of the party producing him or no.&#x2014;Again, certain tests are excluded, by which the capacity and the credit of a witness may best be tried. If I wish to put a witness's memory to the test, I am not allowed to examine him as to the contents of a letter or other paper which he has written. I must put the document into his hands before I ask him any questions upon it, though by so doing he at once becomes acquainted with its contents, and so defeats the object of my inquiry. That question was raised and decided in the Queen's case, after solemn argument, and I humbly venture to think, upon a wrong ground, namely, that the writing is the best evidence and ought to be produced, though it is plain that the object is by no means to prove its contents. Neither am I, in like manner, allowed to apply the test to his veracity: and yet, how can a better means be found of sifting a person's credit, supposing his memory to be good, than examining him to the contents of a letter, written by him, and which he believes to be lost? There is another test, excluded in cases of Libel, of which I shall say the less, as I brought in a Bill some years ago to remedy this defect. The main question in any prosecu-
<col>220</col>
tion for Libel being the innocence or guilt of the publication, is it not preposterous to keep the proof of its truth or falsehood from the view of the Court? Almost every thing else is admitted which can throw any light upon the motives of the party; but that is carefully shut out which is the best test by far of their nature, though certainly only an unilateral test, inasmuch as there must always be guilt, if there is falsehood, though truth does not of necessity prove innocence. Nay, the defendant cannot even now be allowed to urge the truth in mitigation of punishment after conviction; as if there were the same criminality in publishing that a man had been tried and sentenced to the gallows for forgery, who was so sentenced, and that an innocent individual had been sent thither, who never had been tried or even suspected of the offence&#x2014;a case which lately occurred within my own experience.<lb/>
Another test, of a still more important kind, is excluded by a very injudicious refinement of our law,&#x2014;its repugnance to try collateral issues. A foul charge is brought against a man, of rape, or some yet more horrid offence, and the liberty of cross-examining the prosecutor or his witness, whom I will assume to be his fellow conspirator, is, in a most important particular, restrained. The defendant's counsel may address the witness thus&#x2014;"Were you not examined on different occasions, at four or five several sessions, when you sought, by your testimony to convict as many different individuals of an offence similar to that which you now accuse this prisoner of committing, and were not all those persons whom you so prosecuted acquitted? Did not the Court reprimand you for prevarication, nay, order a bill for perjury to be preferred against you?" True, the Council is at liberty to put questions like these; but what, if the witness answers, as in all probability he will, be the fact how it may&#x2014;"No"? The prisoner cannot give evidence in contradiction of the wretch's assertion, at least the practice goes the full length of this. But at any rate it is quite clear law that, if the witness is asked, "Have you not yourself been guilty, repeatedly, of this very crime which you now wish to fasten on the prisoner?" and he should reply, as doubtless he will, "No,"&#x2014;the prisoner is not allowed to adduce evidence of the fact, because, forsooth, the Court cannot try collateral issues," unless the record of a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0118"/>
<col>221</col>
conviction is produced. Nay, I have known judges, though on this they differ, who would not suffer the prosecutrix in a case of rape to be asked, if she had not led an unchaste life before, because a common whore may be ravished,&#x2014;as if the probability of the event were the same in all cases, a mere nothing to the question under consideration.<lb/>
Furthermore, I ask, why should any class of persons be excluded from giving evidence in criminal cases on account of their religious opinions, notwithstanding their testimony is admissible in cases of a civil nature? A quaker is precluded by his religion from taking an oath; his affirmation is received in civil, but rejected in criminal cases. I was once employed, with two of my learned friends, to defend a man, prosecuted by the Attorney-General, for a misdemeanour. We had a very worthy and learned physician, by whose testimony we expected to rebut the charge; but it turned out, when he came to the witness-box, that he was a quaker; of course he would not swear, and equally of course he could not affirm. Our client, also of course, was convicted. This is bad every way; it is bad, for that it suffers guilt to escape; it is bad for that it suffers innocence to be destroyed. The quakers, it is true, desire not to see a change, because, being averse to capital punishments, they do not wish their testimony to be used in capital cases; but they forget that their evidence may be the only means of saving an innocent person from the very punishment of death to which they object, and that, rather than help to hang the guilty&#x2014;a punishment they dislike,&#x2014;they are allowing the innocent to suffer by the self-same punishment. There is, in my opinion, no reason for excluding any individual, be he of what religion, sect, or persuasion he may, from giving testimony in cases of every kind, provided he believes in the existence of a God, and a state of future rewards and punishments; and is not openly infamous by sentence of a court.<lb/>
I have already, in speaking of competence of evidence, said somewhat of presumptions; but there is a class of presumptions which has found its way into the practice of all Courts, and ought, in my opinion, to be carefully excluded; I mean presumptions affecting the weight of evidence&#x2014;tending to withdraw the attention of the Court from the facts of the
<col>222</col>
particular case, and to produce a decision founded upon some kind of average taken from other cases, and because taken at a former period, of course excluding the case in hand. It has thus become almost a rule of law, that perjury can only be proved by two witnesses, or perhaps, by one witness and the defendant's handwriting. Why may not other circumstances exist, quite as sufficient to cast the balance against the oath of the accused, and give credit to his accuser? This presumption goes in favour of the defendant; but there is another, by which he is often, I am convinced, improperly convicted; I mean the rule that an accomplice is entitled to credit in all particulars, provided he be confirmed in some. I once, many years ago, endeavoured to contend for a limitation of this rule, when the late Chief Baron Thompson presided in the Special Commission at York. I maintained that it was necessary to give the confirmation upon some fact which could not be true, consistently with the defendant's guiltlessness. It is certain, however, that the law knows no such qualification, and the Judge whom I have named, than whom no greater criminal lawyer, or more humane and upright man ever existed, ruled, with his reverend brethren, against me; and seventeen men suffered death, some of whom were convicted on the testimony of accomplices. I do not exactly recollect, whether the confirmation was as slight as would barely satisfy the exigency of the rule; but I am very sure, that instances frequently occur in which the story of an accomplice leads to a conviction, while all the witnesses of credit swear only to slight or wholly equivocal circumstances.<lb/>
It is a somewhat similar anomaly in the rules of evidence, that the Court always takes upon itself to construe written instruments, of whatever kind, as if their sense must be matter of law, while the weight of all parol evidence is as invariably left to the Jury. Why should the assistance of the Jury be wholly rejected in this province? It is another and a kindred rule, that where, on the face of a writing, there is an apparent, or as the lawyers term it, a patent ambiguity, no other evidence can be I allowed to explain it; where the ambiguity is latent, or raised by extrinsic evidence, I there other evidence may be adduced to remove it. This principle has been laid down by high legal authority&#x2014;for it is
<image src="S2V0018P0I0119"/>
<col>223</col>
first clearly stated by Lord Chancellor Bacon&#x2014;but I am much disposed to question its correctness. Coupled with the other rule, which excludes the Jury from construing written evidence, it tends greatly to narrow and darken the path to a correct decision.<lb/>
This naturally leads us to examine a little how the Courts have exercised this, which they have thus claimed as their exclusive province&#x2014;and we are thus conducted to a variety of other presumptions respecting evidence, which have been received and acted upon, so as now to have become rules of interpretation, and parcels of the law of the land. With much unfeigned respect for the authority of the great names whose sanction this large branch of our jurispudence has enjoyed, and with much admiration of the ingenuity and astuteness which it has called forth, I must be permitted to say, that, considering the paramount object of all law&#x2014;its use as a rule of life for the people,&#x2014;no part of our system is less entitled to praise.<lb/>
It should seem that one obvious principle of construction would be to take words in their plain ordinary sense, and always to construe them alike, in whatever import they might be used. Only let lawyers consider what a mass of technical niceties and real difficulties this would get rid of; only let them reflect on the consequence of following the very opposite course. Why should the same words be differently construed in a will and in a deed? Why do words, which in one species of instrument give an estate in fee, convey only a life-interest in the other? Why should the last words employed in a will overrule the earlier ones, and not in a deed, on the vain refinement that these express a man's latest intention&#x2014;as if the whole taken together were not his latter will as much as the whole taken together are his deed? But even in wills, where we affect most to follow the intent, so nice is the construction, so technical has it become through many decisions of the courts, and so imperfect consequently is the knowledge generally possessed by people on the subject, that a man cannot well be more in the dark on the subject of the distribution of his property after his will has taken effect, by his being naturally dead, than he is at the very moment of making it. In fact, most men, while disposing, or fancy they are
<col>224</col>
disposing of their property, do not, in the least, know what they are doing. An unlearned individual thinks he is giving a life-estate when he is giving an estate in fee, or in tail, and <i>vice vers&#x00E2;</i>. The testator, J. Williams, whose will gave rise to the case of <i>Perrin</i> v. <i>Blake</i>, where the rule in Shelley's case was extended, little dreamt that the first taker was to have the absolute control over the property, when he directed him to take an estate for his life and no longer. Observe, I am far from complaining of that any more than Shelley's case. The refinement which unites the particular estate with the remainder, in issue of the first taker, is little more than an application of the simplest rule in law, that an estate to a man and his heirs (or, which is the same thing, to a man for life, with remainder to his heirs,) is a fee simple. But the law should prevent the niceties arising from following out its principles, from misleading those who are ignorant of those principles. By freeing it from such technicalities you would, I think, rather elevate the study of jurisprudence and raise its professors;&#x2014;I am certain you would benefit all the rest of the King's subjects. It is hardly to be conceived how much, as matters at present stand, a man who makes his will is in the dark as to its final operation. Thus the creditor who appoints his debtor executor to his will, is considered as having granted a release of the debt: what ordinary person would think he had done so? The very same reason that induced him to lend the money, friendship, blood, confidence, and to count upon its faithful repayment, naturally leads him to appoint the borrower his executor. I have known it happen in this way fifty times in the country, yet the debt is gone at law; and equity will only relieve by holding the executor a trustee, where there are other debts and no free fund to pay them, or some words showing an intention to revive the debt&#x2014;words not very likely to be used by a person who never dreamt of its being extinguished. Then suppose a man has made two wills of the same date, and cancels one of them; it is held that, in certain circumstances, he cancels the other. If one of the wills is at his banker's, the law raises a strong presumption that by cancelling his own copy he intended to cancel that, when the probability is, that he cancels because he is aware there is a duplicate, and does not wish to have the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0120"/>
<col>225</col>
first lying about his house. When both copies are in his own possession, the law does not entertain so strong a suspicion of the intention to annul the will, by cancelling one. Still, however, the presumption is raised; an individual may be thus held to have died intestate, who never entertained any intention of the kind: and his property may pass away from those near relatives or favoured friends to whom he destined it, and be given to his hundred-and-fiftieth cousin, or, for default of legitimate relatives, may be vested in the Crown. But it is not thus only that a person may revoke his will without knowing it, and die intestate while he thinks he is disposing of his property. He may happen to do so by the very act he performed with a view of confirming his testament and establishing his purpose. A recovery suffered, unless the will be republished, destroys it entirely, upon the nicety, quite consistent, I admit, with strict legal principle, that a new estate is taken back, different from that which was in the testator when he devised. This happens frequently to frustrate the plain intent of parties. Lately in the Court of King's-bench we had an instance of large property in this immediate neighbourhood, going any where rather than according to its owner's intention, because a recovery had been suffered; and a recovery, suffered for the express purpose of confirming the will, deprived Lord Erskine of a large estate in Derbyshire. So a conveyance, which divests an estate though but for an instant, to serve a use, with the intention of immediately taking back the former uses, which are accordingly taken back, totally revokes the will made before.<sup>*</sup> Nay no less a judge than Lord Hardwicke has expressly laid it down that where a man, supposing he had only an estate tail on which a devise could not operate, suffers a recovery for the express purpose of taking back a fee in order that his will may be good, it is thereby revoked.&#x2020; The most notable part of these excessive refinements is, that they all proceed upon the act being evidence of a presumed intention, when no man can doubt that either there was no such intention, or one of the very opposite description. Thus if I devise lands to a person, and afterwards, for the same reason of favour towards him, by way of making
<quote><sup>*</sup> Cro. Jac. 49. 4 Ves. jun. 656.</quote>

<col>226</col>
him more secure, give him a lease in the same, to commence after my death, he being perhaps tenant for years under me at the time, the will is gone.<sup>*</sup> It thus happens that, in the very act of his life, in which it is most important that a man should see clearly what he is about, and most likely that he should have no professional assistance, he is often wholly in the dark as to the effect of what he is doing.<lb/>
Were I in want of further illustration for this matter, I might go at once to the doctrine of Powers, and show how the thing intended to be permitted is often prevented, and <i>vice vers&#x00E2;</i>, by the view which Courts have taken of what is and what is not a good execution, and which renders it unsafe to give an opinion upon any power, the very words of which have not received a judicial construction. I might go to the still greater niceties in the rules respecting the construction of contingent and executory Uses, a chapter of our law, signalized by the utmost learning and ingenuity of those who have treated it. I might, indeed, at once ask what foundation in reason, or even in analogy, there is for holding that a purpose should be accomplished, by way of executory devise, which cannot be effected by way of contingent remainder; as the mounting a fee upon a fee, or directing a contingent use to spring and enure without any particular estate to support it; if, indeed, I ought not rather to ask why there should be any necessity in either case for a freehold interest to support an after-taken contingent estate, and why there should be any horror of mounting a fee upon a fee, an idea so familiar to the feodists in the sister kingdom, that their strict settlements (always made by deed, for they, having their niceties like ourselves, though of another sort, allow no devise of real property at all) consist of a succession of fees under restraints specifically presented as to alienation and incumbrances. But I will satisfy myself with what has been said on this head, and suggest, as the obvious corollary, a remedy for the great bulk of the mischief I complain of, the

laying down by the Legislature of certain formulae, couched in plain language, and of an import recognized by written law. You give this help to Justices, to prevent convictions and orders being set aside for technical error. Why not give it to men often less learned than they, for disposing of their property? Why not say, that whoever would give a fee, should use these words;&#x2014;an estate for life these; that whoever would cloathe the takers of that estate with certain powers, may do it thus&#x2014;and so forth&#x2014;not stating that such are the only words which shall effect the same purpose, but that at any rate those shall.<lb/>
By such a plan, and by retrenching some refinements which the fund is ample enough to spare, in rules of construction, I know that much curious learning will be brushed away; but I also know that the law will be rendered accessible to those whose rights it is to govern, and that the lay people will gain far more than the learned lose. Thus much for amending the rules of construction. But for the general establishment of sound rules of evidence, I should recommend, first of all, an introduction of one rule as to the manner of examining witnesses, instead of trying issues of fact in one court by written depositions and in another by <i>viv&#x00E2; voce</i> examination, (whereby the same will may be, and sometimes has been supported in Doctors' Commons, upon personalty, which a Court of Nisi Prius has afterwards set aside altogether) in one court by affidavit, by sworn answers to unsworn bills, by yet more clumsy and ineffectual examination, on written interrogatories previously drawn; in another only by parole examination. I would have all matter-of-fact, wheresoever disputed, tried by a jury. For sifting the truth by such a trial, I would admit all records between the parties or their proxies, and all instruments and writings of every kind, of the parties against whom they are used; so much the law now permits; but I would let in whatever documents, written by persons deceased, appear plainly to have been made, without any view to manufacturing evidence. In a word, excluding inferior evidence where better can be obtained, and, therefore, all hearsay absolutely, I would admit whatever could not be deemed to have been done with a view to the fabrication of proof, by the knowledge that such would be receivable. Allowing objections from interest in the event as well as in the
<col>228</col>
question, to weigh only in estimating a witness's credit, I would make no man incompetent to give evidence in any cause, civil or criminal, who was not either an unbeliever in God and a future state, or convicted of some infamous offence. In examining the witnesses, I would suffer a witness to be contradicted as to matters directly affecting his credit, and on which he had been questioned; <sup>*</sup> and in the event of a witness turning out hostile to the party calling him, there can be no sound reason why, subject to the Judge's discretion, he should not be treated as adverse, and even contradicted, without which the latitude at present given by some Judges, only amounts to a power of putting leading questions. Of nonsuits for variance, and other technical defects, I have already spoken.<lb/>
The law respecting Limitations comes as an appendix to the chapter of Evidence. No branch of our jurisprudence is more imperfect, and hardly any more demands revision. Why should there be no statutory limitation of a bond or other specialty? For want of it the Courts have adopted a sort of rule, founded upon presumption of payment, that where the instrument is twenty, or even eighteen years old, sometimes less, (so accurate is the rule,) and no interest has been paid, or other acknowledgment made of the subsistence of the debt, it may be assumed to be satisfied; that the instrument is cancelled they cannot presume, for there it is, seal and all, staring them in the face; but there being no receipt or discharge, and the bond being in the obligee's hand, is surely quite enough to rebut any presumption of payment&#x2014;so that the Courts have really made a law, though a bad and uncertain one, to meet the case. It would be far better to fix at once a period of ten years, after which no action should be maintainable upon specialties.<lb/>
But even in cases where we have a statute of limitation there is hardly any vestige left of the relief which it was intended to afford, owing to the labours of the Courts in finding means of evading its beneficial operation,&#x2014;it was plainly meant as an act of peace and quiet. My noble friend (Lord Plunkett) who presides in

the Court of Common Pleas of the sister kingdom, once said, with his usual felicity of expression, that Time is armed with his scythe to destroy the evidence on which titles rest, but the lawgiver makes him move with healing on his wings to stay the ravages of his weapon. To thwart the design of the Legislature the Courts have been setting up their rules of presumption. At one time they seemed really to hold that any thing, even the simplest expressions, would take a debt out of the statute of limitations; for instance, if a defendant had said&#x2014;"I have paid the debt," he was taken as admitting it, unless he could prove payment. Again, if he said&#x2014;"I owe you nothing," the assertion was taken as an acknowledgment; and he was also required to prove an acquittance of the plaintiff's claim. The reply&#x2014;"Six years have expired" was equally dangerous, though it was only saying out of court what the statute itself allowed him to say in pleading. In fact, so deeply did Lord Erskine feel the difficulties which encompassed the defendant under these efforts of judicial acuteness, that he said the only safe course a defendant could take when his adversary sent a fishing witness to him was to knock him down, for though he might be proceeded against for the assault, he retained the benefit of the statute, as regarded the debt. Although of late the current of decisions (as it is pleasantly termed) has set in more in an opposite direction, there is still abundant room for a provision to give this wholesome law effect. The means are obvious; let nothing but an acknowledgment in writing take any debt out of the statute. In a word, prop the main, pillar of security against stale and unjust demands, the Statute of Limitations, by a beam from that other bulwark against perjury, the Statute of Frauds.<lb/>
The law of Limitation seems to require alteration, not additional enforcement, in the case of real actions. The period for a writ of right is thirty or sixty years, according as the demandant counts on his own or his ancestor's seisin. But in a formedon, which is often termed, as in truth it is, the tenant in tail's writ of right, it is no more than twenty years. The difference surely is founded on no sound reason, and ought to be done away, by a law fixing thirty years as the period of limitation in all real actions, and removing the important difference in construction
<col>230</col>
which Sir T. Plomer's late decision has made from the different expressions used in the statute of Henry VIII. and James I., so as, in many cases of property under lease, to deprive the demandant of his remedy altogether.<lb/>
But in one case there is no limitation at all, I mean that of Church rights. Why should there not be? I admit that the same period ought not to be adopted respecting the Church as the <i>nullum tempus</i> act prescribes for the Crown; but I confess I do not see the necessity of leaving the law as it now stands, and exempting ecclesiastical claims from all restriction whatever. What is the consequence? It was admirably pointed out by a most learned Judge (Mr. B. Wood), in one of the ablest tracts ever written, no less distinguished by closeness of legal argument than by that pure and concise diction peculiar to him. A composition real may have been made between a clergyman and his parishioners, at any time since the restraining statute of Elizabeth; for 200 years the land may have been possessed by the parson, and yet if the original agreement should have been lost, as it is almost sure to be amongst farmers, though no tithe has been taken during all that time, there would be no bar by limitation in the event of the clergyman claiming the tithes; so that it could not be ascertained by whom the land had been given, and the land could not be restored for want of claimants; indeed there are cases in which the clergyman thus retains the land originally given for the composition, and has his tithes paid to boot. I would say, then, with Mr. Burke, take not away from the Church its power of being useful, but deprive her only of that which makes her odious. The reign of Richard I. is the period up to which all rights as against churchmen must be carried; nay even against lay impropriators, to whose case none of the reasons for favouring ecclesiastical claims apply. Yet that period becomes daily more remote and more inapproachable by evidence. Does not every principle of justice require, that lay titles to tithe should be put on the footing of other property, and that for Church rights, properly so called, a period of limitation should be affixed, longer than for other rights, to prevent collusion between incumbents and tithe-payers, and combined, if necessary, with the number of two or three vacancies?<lb/>

vi.&#x2014;The course of my observations has now brought me to the Trial of Issues, raised by the Pleadings, on the Process, and investigated by means of the Evidence. On this branch of the subject I have little to offer. The principles are plain which should guide us, and they are not so widely departed from in practice as to require any great change. Each party should be allowed fully to propound his case in the way most advantageous to himself. All new matter advanced by the one should receive an answer from the other; each should be encouraged and not hindered to bring forward whatever evidence may tend to throw light upon the matter in question. Our practice, at least in modern times, departs a good deal from these principles, but is very easily restored to them. We compel the plaintiff to explain his case, and comment upon it before his witnesses are examined: unless his adversary produces evidence, he has no means of observing, even upon his own case, after he has proved, or attempted to prove it. Hence his opening must be often very general, for fear of his evidence falling short; and hence he often labours under a prejudice from that short opening, which a little explanation might remove. Counsel are every day obliged to open their cases in the dark; experience teaches us in some degree the difference between what is set down and what will be actually sworn; so that a young advocate will give a very different statement on the same brief from a practised one&#x2014;no great compliment to our method of trying causes, in which as little as possible should depend on the forensic skill of practitioners; but even the most experienced are constantly deceived by their instructions; the cause may change its aspect, especially in the cross-examination of their witnesses; and they have no opportunity of correcting the error and preventing the result from turning on a matter wholly foreign to its merits&#x2014;the discretion of those who prepared the brief&#x2014;unless the other party gives evidence. Now, for this very reason, and to gain by his adversary's failure, (a failure not necessarily connected with merits,) he will avoid doing so; he will also avoid it generally, to prevent his own remarks from being answered. Hence much important evidence is every day shut out, by this play of counsel to avoid giving a reply, which the plaintiff should have, whether the defendant calls witnesses or no. Here,
<col>232</col>
as in other things, the system is far from uniform: in Appeal cases, both before the House of Lords and the Privy Council, there is a reply, as of course; and in the Committees of this House, as well as in trials for high treason, there is an opportunity given to each party of commenting on his case, after it has been presented in evidence, by a summing up. The practice is the same in the Ecclesiastical Courts, and the Delegates. I understand that a summing up, or speaking to evidence, as they call it, is allowed in Ireland; in Scotland both prosecutor and prisoner are heard on the evidence after it has been adduced, the want of an explanatory opening being in part supplied by the debate upon the relevancy of the indictment. I believe in civil cases they have adopted our modern practice, instead of the older method to which the Irish adhere.<lb/>
Before leaving this head I may be allowed to suggest an amendment of a minor kind, but of very considerable importance, It would be advantageous to have a Sworn short-hand Writer in every <i>Nisi Prius</i> case. Those who attend our Courts of <i>Nisi Prius</i> are aware how sorely the Judge is hampered, and his attention diverted from more important considerations, by being obliged to take such full notes of the evidence. This practice is necessary, because the only record of the facts of the case is to be found in his notes. Now, the judge is often a slow writer, and, in this respect, men differ so much, that one judge will try three or four causes while another will dispose of only one, and one will impede a cross-examination so as to render it quite ineffectual, while another will never interrupt it at all. It happens likewise that a judge may be an incorrect taker of notes, which not unfrequently leads him to an incorrect decision, at least to an incorrect report of the case when a new trial is moved for. No judges ever write short-hand, and for no other reason, than that their notes may have to be read by another, if the record comes not out of their own court. My honourable friend, the member for Durham, (Mr. M. A. Taylor,) whose suggestions have ever been found most beneficial to judicial proceedings, introduced the great improvement of short-hand writers in our committees, and abridged the delay and expense of those inquiries incalculably. I
<image src="S2V0018P0I0124"/>
<col>233</col>
would have them, if introduced into our courts, take full notes of the proceedings; at the same time I would not hold their notes as conclusive; they might be subject to the correction of the judge on any important matter misapprehended; for he, of course, would take his own note, but only of the principal and the more delicate things, likely to be misunderstood by one ignorant of law. He would soon find where he could trust the short-hand writer and where not; he would be relieved from much labour, merely mechanical, and left free to regard all the bearings of the case, and to take a commanding view of it, so as to bring on a more speedy decision of its merits.<lb/>
But, Sir, I cannot leave the subject of trial without saying somewhat of the general principles regulating Real Actions, sinning as they do against all sense and justice. In other cases the plaintiff begins the attack, and on him it rests to prove his case, to stand or fall by his proof; but, in a Writ of Right, the person in possession fifty-nine years and three-quarters must, according to the existing law, expose his title, pedigree, and all to his opponent, who can lie by and pick holes in them to his own advantage, without being even asked on what ground he relies, until his adversary has proved his case;&#x2014;a great benefit, whatever be his ground; for the Jury must give the property to somebody, and it is likely that the party in possession having failed, the claimant may get in. In Ejectment, though the plaintiff may have held possession for almost twenty years previous to the cause of action arising, yet, if he has been out of possession for one single day, it is incumbent on him to prove his title, and the defendant is not bound to budge if he fail. In this case, too, the plaintiff must pay costs if he fails, even though the person he attacks has been but a day in possession, and cannot have been in above twenty years. In the real action, where the possession may have been near sixty years, the claimant pays not one shilling of costs, for making you prove your title, though he fail entirely in impeaching it.<lb/>
Nor let it be imagined that these evils never occur; I have seen them fully exemplified twice within the last eighteen months. We had a writ of right at York in the spring of 1826, to try the title to many thousands a year, On the eve of the trial we, for the demandant, discovered
<col>234</col>
a defect in the proof of taking the esplees, and were forced to withdraw the record. It came down for trial at the next assizes, when we were astonished to find the defect we had reckoned upon in the tenant's title removed, and on asking where the document produced had been discovered, we were told that it had come to light on searching the Bishop's chancery, at Salisbury, some weeks after the Spring assizes, in which he would have been defeated had we gone to trial. Only see by what an accident the possession of this large estate was saved. Our client was defeated on the freehold as not being the eldest son; he afterwards brought a plaint, in the nature of a real action, in the Court of Lambeth, as youngest son, for the copyhold, which was descendible by borough English. He again failed; but, of course, he paid costs in neither suit.<lb/>
vii.&#x2014;The Trial being had and the Judgment pronounced, there follows the Execution; and in this most important branch of the law, which may be emphatically called the law of Debtor and Creditor, I feel perfectly justified in declaring our system to be the very worst in Europe, departing the most widely from the principles which ought to regulate a creditor's recourse against his debtor. Those principles are abundantly plain. In proportion as before the debt has been proved, the person and property of the party charged should be free from all process not necessary to prevent evasion; so after judgment, ought the utmost latitude be given to obtain satisfaction from all the defendant's property whatever&#x2014;land, goods, money, and debts&#x2014;for to himself they no longer belong. To allow any distinction between one kind of property and another seems the height of injustice. No consistent reasoner can maintain the propriety of exempting land more than chattels; no honest debtor can claim the privilege which he waived when he contracted the debt. In case of a person deceased, all kinds of debts and all creditors should come in equally upon an insolvent estate; and preference only be given in the case of mortgage or other lien. The chattel itself sued for should be returned, and damages only given where it has been lost. The person of the debtor should not be taken in execution unless there is either a wilful concealment of property, or there has been criminal or grossly imprudent conduct in contracting the debt; or the two objects
<image src="S2V0018P0I0125"/>
<col>235</col>
should be kept carefully distinct, of what is done to satisfy the creditor, and what is done to punish the debtor. Lastly, the former should obtain his satisfaction as speedily as may be, and as conveniently for the latter as is consistent with the creditor's security. How widely does our law depart from these obvious and natural principles, by dint of refinements, blunders, and openly avowed injustice&#x0021;<lb/>
First of all, there are only two actions for recovery of chattels, in which we are expected to give the thing specifically sued for, replevin and detinue; yet in neither can the party compel a delivery in kind; and detinue is besides useless, because the defendant may wage his law. In all others the claim is avowedly for damages only. A horse is taken from me, and I sue for it; yet I only obtain damages for its detention; but suppose I want the horse and not the money, the law will not aid me: nay, it will give me not a farthing in consideration of being thus compelled to part with it; I only receive what it would fetch in the market if I chose to sell it. Equity and common law differ widely here; the former always performs in specie; the latter looks to damages only; unless, indeed, where it is inconsistent with itself, as in the summary process to make parties perform awards, and attornies and other officers of the courts deliver up deeds, and pay monies, by means of attachment. But all these are comparatively trifling, and rather absurd in principle, than of extensive injury in practice. What is quite substantial, and of hourly occurrence, is the frustration of a creditor after he has obtained judgment, and taken out execution. His debtor has a landed estate; if it be copyhold, the creditor cannot touch it in any way whatever; if it be freehold, he may take half by elegit, and receive the rents and profits, but no more in the lifetime of his debtor. The debt for which he has received judgment may be such that the rent of the land will not even keep down the interest; still he can take nothing more; he cannot turn the land into money;&#x2014;so that, when a man sues for a thing detained unlawfully, you give him money which he does not ask; and when he asks for money by suing for a debt, you give him land which he does not want. But if his debtor dies before judgment can be obtained, unless the debt is on bond, he has no remedy at all against any kind of real property of any tenure; nay, though
<col>236</col>
his money borrowed on note or bill, has been laid out in buying land, the debtor's heir takes that land wholly discharged of the debt.<lb/>
But not only is land thus sacred from all effectual process of creditors, unless the debtor be a trader; the great bulk of most men's personal property is equally beyond reach of the law. Stock in the public funds&#x2014;debts due in any manner of way&#x2014;nay, bank notes, and even money&#x2014;are alike protected. I may owe a hundred thousand pounds in any way, and judgment may have passed against me over and over again; if I have privilege of parliament, live in a furnished house or hotel, and use hired carriages and horses, I may have an income from stock or money lent, of twenty thousand a-year, and defy the utmost efforts of the law; or if I have not privilege, I may live abroad, or within the rules (as some actually do,) and laugh at all the courts and all the creditors in the country. So absurd are our rules in this respect, that if I have borrowed a thousand pounds, and the creditor has obtained judgment, the Sheriff's officer appointed to levy upon my personalty may come into my room and take a table or a desk; but if he sees the identical thousand pounds lying there he must leave it&#x2014;he touches it at his peril:&#x2014;"For this quaint reason," says Lord Mansfield, "because money cannot be sold, and you are required by the writ to take your debt out of the produce of goods sold." It is true, that great judge, whose merits as a lawyer were never underrated, except by persons jealous of his superior fame, or ignorant of the law, (among whom was a writer much admired in his day, but of very questionable purity, and certainly no lawyer,) leaned to a contrary construction of the creditor's powers, and might have somewhat irregularly introduced it. But Lord Ellenborough afterwards denounced such attempts as perilous innovations on the fundamental principles of our jurisprudence; and the law is now settled on this point. And here, Sir, let me step aside to ask who is the innovator,&#x2014;he who would adhere to such rules in violation of the manifest intent and spirit of our old law, or he who would re-adjust them so as to give it effect? In ancient times there were none of those masses of property in existence, which are exempt from legal process. When the law, therefore, said "Let all a man's goods and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0126"/>
<col>237</col>
chattels be amenable for his debts," it meant to include his whole personalty at the least. Things have now changed in the progress of society; trade has grown up; credit has followed in its train; money, formerly only used as counters, has become abundant; banker's accounts have been invented; paper currency and the funds have been created. Three-fourths of the debtor's personalty, perhaps nine-tenths, now consist of stock, money, and credit; and the rule of law which leaves those out of all execution, no longer can mean as before&#x2014;"Let all his personalty be liable"&#x2014;but let a tenth-part of it only be taken.&#x2014;Can there be a greater change effected upon, or greater violence done to, the old law itself, than you do by affecting to preserve its letter? The great stream of time is perpetually flowing on; all things around us are in ceaseless motion; and we vainly imagine to preserve our relative position among them, by getting out of the current and standing stock still. The stately vessel we belong to glides down; our bark is attached to it; we might "pursue the triumph, and partake the gale;" but, worse than the fool who stands expecting the current to flow down and run out, we exclaim&#x2014;Stop the boat&#x0021;&#x2014;and would tear it away to strand it, for the sake of preserving its connexion with the vessel. All the changes that are hourly and gently going on in spite of us, and all those which we ought to make, that violent severances of settled relations may not be effected, far from exciting-murmurs of discontent, ought to be gladly hailed as dispensations of a bountiful Providence, instead of filling us with a thoughtless and preposterous alarm.<lb/>
But the imperfect recourse against the debtor's estate, although the grand opprobrium of our law, is by no means its only vice: the unequal distribution, in case of Insolvency, is scarcely a less notable defect. Only traders, or those who voluntarily take the benefit of the act, are compelled, when insolvent, to make an impartial division of their property. All others may easily, and with impunity, pay one creditor twenty shillings in the pound, and the others sixpence or nothing. So, when a man dies insolvent, his representatives may, by acknowledging judgments, secure one creditor his full payment at the expense of all the rest. Then, lax and impotent as the law is against property, wide as are its loop holes for fraud
<col>238</col>
and extravagance to escape by, utterly powerless as is its grasp to seize the great bulk of the debtor's possessions, against his useless person it is equally powerful and unrelenting. The argument used is, that the concealed property may thus be wrung from him: the principle, however, of the law, and on which all its provisions are built, is, that the seizure of the body works a satisfaction of the claim; and this satisfaction is given alike in all cases&#x2014;alike where there is innocent misfortune, culpable extravagance, and guilty embezzlement. Surely, for all these evils the remedy is easy; it flows at once from the principles I set out with under this head. Let the whole of every man's property, real and personal&#x2014;his real, of what kind soever, copyhold, leasehold, freehold; his personal, of whatever nature, debts, money, stock, chattels&#x2014;be taken for the payment of all his debts equally, and in case of insolvency, let all be distributed rateably; let all he possesses be sifted, bolted from him unsparingly, until all his creditors are satisfied by payment or composition; but let his person only be taken when he conceals his goods, or has merited punishment by his extravagance or his crime. This line of distinction is already recognized by the practice of the Insolvent Courts; but the privilege of the Rule is inconsistent with every principle, and ought at once to be abrogated as soon as arrest on mesne process is abolished.<sup>*</sup><lb/>
viii.&#x2014;The last subject which presents itself to our notice is the Appeal from judgments recovered. Here, as in every other branch of our jurisprudence, the Courts of Law and of Equity proceed on opposite principles, though dealing with the same matter. In the former, you can only appeal on matter of law appearing upon the face of the record, or added to it by bill of exceptions, and never in any case before final judgment. In the latter, you can appeal from any interlocutory order as well as from the final decree, and upon all matter of fact as well as of law. So it is in the Ecclesiastical Courts, where a grievance (or complaint upon interlocutory matter) is as much the subject of appellate jurisdiction as the appeal from the final sentence; and
<quote><sup>*</sup> This arrest, the end of which, it is to be hoped, fast approaches, was not generally given by the common law. The <i>capias ad respondendum</i> is given in debt and detinue by West. 2 (13 Ed, 1.) cap. 11, in case only so late as 19 H. 7. c. 9.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0127"/>
<col>239</col>
the Court above sits on all the facts as well as on the law.<lb/>
The principal evil of Courts of Error, is the stay of execution which they effect, thereby giving the losing party in possession an interest in prosecuting groundless appeals. The Bill of the Right Hon. Gentleman (Mr. Peel) being a partial measure, while it intended to remedy this evil, has rather increased it; because another more costly mode of obtaining the same delay being left open, the parties by defending actions in themselves without defence, avail themselves of it, to the enormous multiplication of frivolous defences. The true remedy I take to be this. Let the party who obtains a judgment be so far presumed right as to get instant possession or execution, upon giving ample security for restitution should the sentence be reversed. This is the rule in the Cape and other of our Colonies; in the Cape, two sureties each in double the amount, are required. It would also be an excellent modification of this principle, to vest in judges the discretion of ordering the execution to be levied by instalments, upon reasonable security being given. Hurried seizures, and sales for next to nothing, would thus be avoided; as would the destruction of many valuable concerns, to the ruin of the debtor and the loss of the creditor also. The reasonable delay thus safely granted would further tend to prevent groundless appeals and frivolous defences, for mere dilatory purposes. The details of this measure would be easily arranged; I am sure that it well merits inquiry, if I shall obtain a Commission.<lb/>
I have now followed the proceedings in our Courts through their whole course; and it will be observed, that I have said little or nothing of Costs&#x2014;an important subject; perhaps, taken in all its bearings, the most important of any; but which has so far been disposed of, in its principal relation, by the discussion of whatever tends to shorten litigation. A great, perhaps the greatest, evil of our system, as at present constituted, is the excess of the costs which a party succeeding is obliged to pay, over and above what he can re cover from his antagonist. This is so certain and so considerable, that a man shall in vain ask me to recommend him either to bring forward a rightful claim, or to resist an unjust demand for any such sum as twenty, or even thirty pounds&#x2014;at least, upon, a calculation of his interest, I
<col>240</col>
should presently declare to him, he had much better say nothing in the one case, and pay the money a second time in the other, even if he had a stamped receipt in his pocket, provided his adversary were a rich and oppressive man, resolved to take all the advantages the law gives him. I have here before me some samples of taxed bills of costs, taken quite at random, and far from being peculiar cases in any one respect. There is one of 428<i>l</i>., made out by a very respectable attorney, and from which the Master deducted 202<i>l</i>.; of this sum, 147<i>l</i>. were taken off, which had been paid for bringing witnesses. In this other, amounting to 217<i>l</i>., 76<i>l</i>. were taxed off; and in a third of 63<i>l</i>., there were nearly 15<i>l</i>. disallowed; it was an undefended cause, to recover 50<i>l</i>.: had the defendant been obstinate and oppressively inclined, he would have made the extra costs a good deal more than the whole debt, although the suit was in the Exchequer, where the taxation is known to be more liberal. We had lately in the King's-bench, a bill of above 100<i>l</i>. to recover 19<i>l</i>., and, probably of that 100<i>l</i>. not above 60<i>l</i>. would be allowed. As things now stand, a part of this master evil is inevitable; for if practitioners were sure of receiving all their bills, they would run up a heavy charge wherever they knew the case to be a clear one. But as the fundamental principle for which I contend is, to alter no part of the law by itself, or without considering all the other parts, there can be no difficulty, consistently with this doctrine, to enlarge the allowance of costs as soon as other amendments have prevented the abuse of litigation by professional men.<lb/>
Some erroneous rules of taxation may, even in a partial or insulated reform, be altered. Whatever is fairly allowed as between attorney and client, should be allowed between party and party, except only such needless charges as have been ordered expressly by the client himself. There can surely be no reason for disallowing, as a general rule, all consultations, often absolutely necessary for the conduct of a cause, generally more beneficial than much that is allowed; nor can it be right, that so little of the expense of bringing evidence should be given, and that the cost of preparing the case by inquiries, journies, &amp;c, should be refused altogether. The necessary consequence of not suffering an attorney to charge what he ought to receive for certain things,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0128"/>
<col>241</col>
is that he is driven to do a number of needless things; which he knows are always allowed as a matter of course, and the expense is thus increased to the client far beyond the mere gain which the attorney derives from it. I have a great doubt whether benefit would not result from leaving the costs more in the discretion of the Court which tries a cause than they now are: in equity, they are always so in the fullest extent; at law, almost all is fixed by statute.<lb/>
Sir, in casting an eye over the wide field which we have been surveying, I trust the House will perceive that, although I have, for the most part, arranged my observations under the different stages through which causes are carried in our superior courts, I have yet been enabled to discuss the greater and by much the more important parts of our municipal jurisprudence. Indeed, with the exception of Commercial law, I am not aware of having left any branch untouched that seemed to require amendment. I stated, in the outset, the reason why that formed no immediate part of my plan. A great portion of it is common to all trading countries, the law-merchant, and is extremely well adapted to its purpose, being of comparatively modern growth, and framed according to the exigencies of commerce. Some other parts, however, are exceedingly defective. It would be difficult to point out greater uncertainty or more caprice in any branch of the system than are to be found in the law of Partnership. A man can hardly tell whether he is a partner or not; being a partner, the extent of his liability is scarcely less difficult to ascertain; and he will often find it in vain to consult his lawyer on these important matters.<sup>*</sup> The distribution of estates under the Bankrupt law is likewise capable of very great improvement. After all that was lately done in arranging and simplifying this code, it re-
<quote><sup>*</sup> The execution of judgments on partnership property is a remarkable example. The Sheriff must sell an undivided share, say a moiety of the whole: and the purchaser becomes tenant in common with the solvent partner, who may find the East India Company or Government his co-tenant, and be still liable to account to the other partner for his share of the profits; because the very effect of the execution which has let in so disagreeable a co-tenant of the stock will naturally be, to avoid a-going to prison (the only involuntary act of bankruptcy), and thus prevent a dissolution of the partnership.</quote>
<col>242</col>
mains full of contradictions, and the source of innumerable frauds and endless litigation. But into these things I abstain from entering. I must, however, once more press upon the attention of the House, the necessity of taking a general view of the whole system in whatever inquiries may be instituted. Partial legislation on such a subject is pregnant with mischief. Timid men, but still more blind than they are timid, recommend taking a single branch at a time, and imagine that they are consulting the safety of the mass. It is the very reverse of safe. In the body of the law all the members are closely connected; you cannot touch one without affecting the rest; and if your eye is confined to the one you deal with, you cannot tell what others may be injured, and how. Even a manifest imperfection may not be removed without great risk, when it is not in some wholly insulated part; for it oftentimes happens that, by long use, a defect has given rise to some new arrangement extending far beyond itself, and not to be disturbed with impunity. The topical reformer, who confines his care to one flaw, may thus do as much injury as a surgeon who should set himself about violently reducing a luxation of long standing, where nature had partially remedied the evil by forming a false joint, or should cut away some visceral excrescence in which a new system of circulation and other action was going on. Depend upon it, the general reformation of such a mechanism as our law is not only the most effectual, but the only safe course. This, in truth, alone deserves the name of either a rational or a temperate reform.<lb/>
Then, what ground can there be for taking alarm at the course I recommend of amendment, and proceeding by careful, but general inquiry? It is, indeed, nothing new, even of late years, in this country. We appointed a Commission to investigate the whole administration of justice in Scotland; and it ended in altering the constitution of the Courts, and introducing a new mode of trying causes. Yet Scotland, to say nothing of the treaty of Union, so often set up as a bulwark against all change, might urge some very powerful reasons for upholding her ancient system, which we in England should vainly seek to parallel. She might hold up her Statute-book in three small pocket volumes, the whole fruit of as many centuries of legislation, while your table bends beneath
<image src="S2V0018P0I0129"/>
<col>243</col>
the laws of a single reign&#x2014;and of your whole jurisprudence, it may be said as of the Roman before Justinian, that it would overload many camels. But I do not merely cite, against alarms or scruples, that bold, and wise, and safe measure of Lord Grenville; older authority, and in the Courts of Westminster, are with me. I will rely on Lord Hale, whose celebrated Treatise "Of the Amendment of the Law," (far less studied, I fear, by our jurisconsults, than that of Fortescue<sup>*</sup>), well exposes the folly of such fears, with their origin. "By long use and custom (says he) men especially that are aged, and have been long educated to the profession and practice of the law, contract a kind of superstitious veneration of it beyond what is just and reasonable. They tenaciously and rigorously maintain those very forms and proceedings, and practices, which, though possibly at first they were seasonable and useful, yet by the very change of matters they become not only useless and impertinent, but burthensome and inconvenient, and prejudicial to the common justice and the common good of mankind; not considering the forms and prescripts of laws were not introduced for their own sakes, but for the use of public justice; and therefore, when they become insipid, useless, impertinent, and possibly derogatory to the end, they may and must be removed." Such is the language of Sir M. Hale. After Lord Coke and Littleton himself, there is no higher authority in the law than Shepherd, the author of the "Touchstone," who, in another of his works, called "England's Balm, or Proposals by way of Grievance and Remedy, &amp;c, towards the Regulation of the Law and better Administration of Justice," reminds his legal brethren, that "taking away the abuse of the law will establish the use of the law&#x2014;<i>stabilit usum qui tollit abusum</i>&#x2014;and that rooting up the tares will not destroy the wheat&#x2020;." If the House require further authorities upon this point, I can refer them to one of the ablest and most instructive books published of late years, that of Mr. Parkes, a

respectable Solicitor in Warwickshire, who, in giving the history of the Court of Chancery, has collected most of the authorities upon the subject of Legal Reform.<lb/>
But our predecessors, members of this House in the seventeenth century, an age fruitful of great improvements, most of which were retained in more quiet times, undertook the amendment of the Law systematically, and with a spirit and a wisdom every way worthy of so great a work. In 1654, a Commission was formed partly of the House, partly of learned strangers. At the head of the former, I find my Honourable Friend the Solicitor General's less learned and more martial predecessor, called in the Journals Lord General Cromwell. But in front of the latter stands "Sir Matthew Hale," afterwards the Great Chief Justice, whose name is ever cited amongst the most venerable supporters of our Civil and our Religious Establishment. With them were joined all the great Jurisconsults and Statesmen of that illustrious age. They sat for five years, and proposed a number of the most important and general reforms. I will read the titles of a few Acts, the draughts of which the Commissioners prepared:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. For taking away Fines upon Bills, Declarations, and Original Writs.</li>
<li>2. For taking away Common Recoveries, and the unnecessary Charges of Fines, and to pass and charge Lands entailed as Lands in Fee-simple.</li>
<li>3. For ascertaining of Arbitrary Fines upon Descent and Alienation of Copyholds of Inheritance.</li>
<li>4. For the more speedy recovery of Rents.</li>
<li>5. For the better regulating of Pleaders and their Fees.</li>
<li>6. For the more speedy and easy recovery of Debts and Damages not exceeding the sum of Four Pounds.</li>
<li>7. For the further declaration and prevention of Fraudulent Contracts and Conveyances.</li>
<li>8. Against the Sale of Offices.</li>
<li>9. For the recovery of Debts owing by Corporations.</li>
<li>10. To make Debts assignable.</li>
<li>11. To prevent solicitation of Judges, Bribery, Extortion, Charge of Motions, and for restriction of Pleaders.</li>
<li>12. An Act for all County Registers, Will, and Administrators; and for preventing Inconvenience, Delay, Charge, and Irregularity, in Chancery and Com-

mon Law (as well in Common Pleas as criminal and capital Causes).</li>
<li>13. Acts for settling County Judicatures, Guardians of Orphans, Courts of Appeal, County Treasurers, and Workhouses, with Tables of Fees and Short Forms of declaration.</li>
<li>14. An Act to allow Witnesses to be sworn for prisoners.</li>
</ol>
The House is aware that till much later in our history, by the great wisdom, justice, and humanity of our ancestors, it was provided, that the witnesses for a defendant should not deliver their testimony upon oath; until the time of Queen Anne, the prosecutor only was allowed to prove his case, by sworn evidence; and the communication of the same right to the defendant, may be looked upon by some as a rude invasion of the ancient system, and a cruel departure from the perfections of the olden time.<lb/>
This is not the only measure prepared by that celebrated Commission which has been since adopted, as the House will see by the enumeration I have given.<sup>*</sup> But steps were taken immediately after the Restoration, for prosecuting its plans more systematically. A Committee was appointed by this House to examine the state of the Law and its practice; Sergeant Maynard and other eminent lawyers were members of it. From their numbers, fifty-one, I presume they subdivided themselves, for the convenience of inquiring separately into different branches of the subject. Upon their reports several Bills were brought in for the general reform of the Law; but in tracing their progress through the House, the prorogation appears to have come before any of them were passed. A long interval has elapsed of various fortune, and filled with vast events, but marked, from age to age, by a steady course of improvement, when we are again called to the grand work of surveying and amending our Laws. For this task, it well becomes us to begird ourselves, as the honest representatives of the people. Dispatch and vigour are imperiously demanded; but that deliberation, too, must

<col>246</col>
not be lost sight of, which so mighty a matter requires. When we shall have done the work, we may fairly challenge the utmost approval of our constituents; for in none other have they so deep a stake.<lb/>
In pursuing the course which I now invite you to enter upon, I avow that I look for the co-operation of the King's Government. And, on what are my hopes founded? Men gather not grapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles. But that the vine should no longer yield its wonted increase&#x2014;that the fig tree should refuse its natural fruit&#x2014;require a miracle to strike it with barrenness. There are in the present Ministry, men whose known liberal opinions have lately been anew proclaimed to the world, and pledges have been avouched for their influence upon the measures of the government. With them, others may not, upon all subjects, agree; upon this, I would fain hope there will be found little difference. But, be this as it may, whether I have the support of the Ministers or no&#x2014;to the House I look with confident expectation, that it will control them, and assist me; if I go too far, checking my progress&#x2014;if too fast, abating my speed&#x2014;but heartily and honestly helping me in the best and greatest work, which the hands of the law-giver can undertake. The course is clear before us; the race is glorious to run. You have the power of sending your name down through all times, illustrated by deeds of higher fame, and more useful import, than ever were done within these walls. You saw the greatest warrior of the age&#x2014;the conqueror of Italy&#x2014;the humbler of Germany&#x2014;the terror of the North&#x2014;account all his matchless victories poor, compared with the triumph you are now in a condition to win&#x2014;saw him contemn the fickleness of fortune, while, in despite of her, he could pronounce his memorable boast, "I shall go down to posterity with the Code in my hand&#x0021;" You have vanquished him in the field; strive now to rival him in the sacred arts of peace&#x0021; Outstrip him as a lawgiver, whom in arms you overcame&#x0021; The glories of the regency will be eclipsed by the more solid and enduring splendour of the reign. The praise which fawning courtiers feigned for our Edwards and Harrys, the Justinians of their day, will be the just tribute of the wise and the good to that monarch under whose sway so mighty a

work shall be accomplished. Of a truth, sceptres are most chiefly to be envied for that they bestow the power of thus conquering and ruling thus. It was the boast of Augustus&#x2014;it formed part of the lustre in which the perfidies of his earlier years were lost&#x2014;that he found Rome of brick, and left it of marble; a praise not unworthy a great prince, and to which the present reign is not without claims. But how much nobler will be our Sovereign's boast, when he shall have it to say, that he found law dear, and left it cheap; found it a sealed book&#x2014;left it a living letter; found it the patrimony of the rich&#x2014;left it the inheritance of the poor; found it the two-edged sword of craft and oppression&#x2014;left it the staff of honesty and the shield of innocence&#x0021; To me, much reflecting on these things, it has always seemed a worthier honour to be the instrument of making you bestir yourselves in this high matter, than to enjoy all that office can bestow&#x2014;office, of which the patronage would be an irksome incumbrance, the emoluments superfluous to one who had rather, with the rest of his industrious fellow-citizens, make his own hands minister to his wants; and as for the power supposed to follow it&#x2014;I have lived half a century, and I have seen that power and place may be severed. But one power I do prize: that of being the advocate of my countrymen here, and their fellow-labourer elsewhere, in those things which concern the best interests of mankind. That power, I know full well, no government can give&#x2014;no change take away&#x0021;<lb/>
I move you, Sir, "That an humble Address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he will graciously be pleased to issue a Commission for inquiring into the defects, occasioned by time and otherwise, in the Laws of this realm of England, as administered in the Courts of Common Law, and the remedies which may be expedient for the same."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00202"><member>The Solicitor General</member><membercontribution> said, that at that late hour the House would little expect of him, that he should follow his hon. and learned friend through the patient, long, and elaborate, detail, into which he had entered. It seemed to him that the House would arrive&#x2014;if not at as speedy, at least at a more safe conclusion&#x2014;if it allowed itself time for reflection, by a short adjournment of the present debate. It would be an ill compliment to his hon. and learned friend, if he were to affect to be
<col>248</col>
prepared to answer what had been so ably and so eloquently advanced on subjects of such vast extent and such deep importance. By allowing time for meditation, and for collecting and marshalling their thoughts, the House would be better able to come to a correct conclusion on a future day. It would not be supposed for a moment that he meant to contend that the law in this country had arrived at such a degree of perfection, as to be incapable of further improvement; but he hoped that hon. members would keep their minds in suspense, until the time for discussion arrived. He would therefore move, that the debate be adjourned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00203"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> concurred in the propriety of an adjournment till to-morrow fortnight.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00204"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;I cannot, Sir, allow the present occasion to pass without offering a few words. I rejoice that the hon. and learned member concurs in the propriety of the proposal for an adjournment; and it will render it unnecessary for me at present to enter into any detailed discussion. Independently of those difficulties, under which, under any circumstances, I must have laboured, from want of professional knowledge and professional habits, I am sure the House will readily believe, that the occupation in which I have been engaged for the last few days, has tended still further to incapacitate me for the task of discussion at present. I can only speak, therefore, rather of the spirit in which the proposition is made, than attempt to follow the hon. and learned gentleman, who has gone through his great subject with such patience and investigation, and such ability of illustration. I fully concur in the opinion, that it would be unwise to arrive now at a precipitate but conclusive vote; and I think the hon. and learned gentleman must himself perceive, that the terms of his motion are so general, that it is impossible from thence to form any precise notion of the nature of the reforms which he would introduce. I do not mean to quarrel with the generality of those terms; but until the explanation of to-night, speculation as their precise object was rather calculated to mislead. Hence an additional reason is afforded for not calling upon the House at present to express any distinct opinion. The hon. and learned gentleman's notice referred to certain reforms in the law, and its administration in the courts, as time had rendered necessary
<image src="S2V0018P0I0132"/>
<col>249</col>
or as experience had shewn to be expedient; and to the principle of such reforms, I am almost the last person in the House to object. I have myself attempted to proceed upon it in the amelioration which I have attempted of the Criminal law. I found benefit of clergy and various other institutions&#x2014;no doubt, wise at, the time they were introduced&#x2014;unfit for present circumstances, and that a change was necessary. I did not hesitate to propose that change; and for this reason&#x2014;I could not hold prescription as a sufficient ground, why we should not inquire, calmly and deliberately, what alterations experience had proved to be expedient.<lb/>
Into all the latter part of the hon. and learned member's speech, I profess myself wholly unable to enter: but upon one or two points connected with the constitution of our courts, I will say a few words. I am now prepared to express my approbation of the principle of much that fell from the hon. and learned member. He adverted, among other things, to the propriety of equalising the business in the three courts of justice; and he pointed out the advantages to be derived, if the courts of Exchequer, Common Pleas, and King's Bench, could be really and practically put on an equality, as to the transaction of business. Surely, every one must concur in the principle, if it can be carried into effect. As to the mode in which that principle can be so carried into effect, I am not prepared to express an opinion. The hon. and learned member also referred to the sort of monopoly established in the court of Common Pleas, by confining the practice to Serjeants. I believe that point has engaged the attention of the present lord Chancellor, and that the eminent judge who presides in that court is not indisposed to a change.&#x2014;Again, as to the Exchequer, where, it seems, the power of instituting a suit is confined to the clerks of the court&#x2014;guarding against injury to vested interests, it may be very fit to inquire whether it would not be right to open a more extensive system of practice. I am quite sure the House will perceive, that the fear of doing injury even to vested interests ought not to prevent it from adopting important improvements. Compensation may be granted, or the vested interest may be permitted to expire with the life of the present holder of any appointment; but this consideration ought not to obstruct any necessary or wholesome
<col>250</col>
reform. Still less am I inclined to shew any peculiar attachment to the number "twelve" for the judges; or to resist any proposition for an inquiry whether they ought not to be increased, for the better administration of public justice. I believe there have been periods when the number of judges was more than twelve, and it may, for aught I know, be very fit to revert to that practice. The hon. and learned gentleman certainly mistakes my view, if he supposes I am disposed to shew peculiar attachment to the particular number at present existing, even if in former times that number had not been greater. But I am unwilling, Sir, that the House should now express any positive opinion upon this point. If I understand the hon. and learned gentleman right, he would add one judge to the court of Common Pleas, and one to the court of King's Bench, making five to each court; and he would cause the judges who did the out-of-door work to be placed in rotation. If this was not the case, I should have a strong objection to any measure which went to make any one judge less respectable than another; and I could never consent to make, in any manner, one of those judges who are to preside in a criminal court less respectable&#x2014;[Mr. Brougham said, across the table, it was his intention that the judges should take the out-of-door work in rotation]. I therefore, Sir, shall not object, if the judges cannot now get through the business, that it should be facilitated by having five judges in a court.<lb/>
There is another point to which I will refer, and one on which, I am afraid, I should be induced to differ from the hon. and learned gentleman. He recommends that the judges should be paid by fees; but I much doubt the wisdom of this opinion. The learned gentleman says, he would control the fees, and give the judges only a certain and a qualified interest in them, but sufficient to secure their attention to their duty, and to promote the despatch of business. But I am disposed to think, that much of the deference paid to the judges depends on their dignity; that much of the impression which they make on the public mind, much of the respect paid them by the people, particularly by the lower classes of the people, depended on the opinion of their purity. I should be sorry to hazard this, by giving them an interest in despatching causes;
<image src="S2V0018P0I0133"/>
<col>251</col>
and I think the advantages which might be obtained by procuring a little more despatch of business, would not be compensated by the evil arising from giving the judge an interest, of any kind, in causes. The judge would either be induced by it to do more business, or he would not; if he were not induced to do more business, no advantage would result from the change; if he were induced to do more business, it might be suspected that he made too much despatch, and that impression of respect which he now excited might be lost. Might not the party who was dissatisfied with his decision think his case had not been sufficiently inquired into?&#x2014;that it had not engaged enough of the judge's attention, who had been more eager to obtain fees by the despatch of business, than to do justice? I think, Sir, under the present system, the substitution of fees for a salary to the judges, would not answer the learned gentleman's expectations; and that the only advantage arising from it&#x2014;the despatch of a little more business&#x2014;would not compensate the evil of the impression which would be made on the minds of the public by the judges taking fees.<lb/>
There is another point, Sir, on which I cannot agree with the hon. and learned gentleman. He argues for a strict adherence to the rule, that a puisne judge should not be promoted to a higher seat on the bench. I agree with him, Sir, that as a general rule, it is a good one; but if it were invariably and rigidly adhered to, it would sometimes lead to the commission of great injustice towards individuals, and inflict a serious injury on the public service. To say that a puisne judge, however uprightly he may conduct himself, however high may be his character for independence and honour, however much he may adorn the judicial seat&#x2014;to say that such a man was never to be promoted, is, in my opinion, neither wise nor just. I agree with the learned gentleman, that to promote a puisne judge, on account of his subserviency to the Crown, would be an erroneous proceeding; but I cannot agree with him, that we ought rigidly to adhere to the rule, never to promote a puisne judge. It does so happen, Sir, that in the speech which the learned gentleman has just delivered, the two judges on whom he has passed a just and well-merited panegyric&#x2014;lord Tenterden, whom he has characterised as one of the ablest judges that
<col>252</col>
ever presided in the court of King's-bench, and chief baron Thompson, who has gained the respect of every man; it does so happen, Sir, that these two judges, the only two referred to by the hon. and learned gentleman, were promoted, from being puisne judges. Would it not have been an injustice to those excellent men, and would not the public service have suffered a serious injury, if those judges had not been promoted; particularly in the case of lord Tenterden, who had not risen to such eminence as an advocate, as to have necessarily inferred, that he was to become an eminent judge? The hon. and learned gentleman's own instances shew that an invariable adherence to the rule which he recommends would operate as a hardship on individuals, and be a detriment to the public.<lb/>
With respect to fixing the terms, so that the holidays and the times of business shall recur periodically; there are two terms already invariable, and I do not know why we should not have four. I do not know why members of parliament should not be able to foresee when they must attend their business in the country. I see no reason for adhering to a system which makes two terms moveable, and two fixed; and I think it would be advisable to make all the four fixed. For why should we have two fixed, and two dependent on the moon?<lb/>
Another point to which the learned gentleman has referred is the salary of the judge of the Admiralty court, which in peace is only 2,500<i>l</i>. per year, and in war, may amount to between ten and eleven thousand. Now, Sir, I do not know why the fees of these judges should not be abolished, and an equal salary given them, both in peace and war. The public will not suffer by that change, and the judge will not be injured. There is another point on which I will just say a few words; namely, the number of appeals before the Privy Council. No doubt the learned gentleman has drawn his information from papers laid on the table of the House; but I think he has drawn an erroneous conclusion, as to the delay of business, and the quantity of business not transacted, from those documents. He thinks that not more than forty cases out of the five hundred and ten appeals which have been made from the East and West Indies, and from Guernsey and Jersey, have been decided. The learned gentleman has collected this information from
<image src="S2V0018P0I0134"/>
<col>253</col>
the returns, but those returns include all the cases which have been compromised or settled abroad, and being left on the list, lead to an erroneous conclusion. The: five hundred and ten cases also included appeals from Guernsey and Jersey, which were only for summonses. In many of those which are sent from the East Indies to this country, there is no agent appointed to carry them on, and they cannot be brought forward for decision. I admit that the appeals from the East Indies are of very great importance; and the practice of carrying them before the Privy Council is one which may require examination. Out of the appeals made to the Privy Council since 1800, eighty-two have been from the East Indies, and in fifty-three of them no agent has appeared on either side. In sixty-seven instances no case has been drawn up either by the appellant or appellee; thus of the eighty-two cases nominally before the Privy Council, in sixty-seven there was no case submitted to it, and it was impossible that it should proceed to adjudication. When cases are not complete, the council has no means of proceeding. The native of India, perhaps, does not know that it is necessary, in sending an appeal to this country, that he should appoint an agent: he does not know, perhaps, the means of carrying on his appeal; which makes the whole subject of considerable importance, and deserving of attention and inquiry.<lb/>
There is another point in the learned gentleman's speech, to which I wish to refer; namely, that which relates to the appointment of justices of the peace. The learned gentleman doubts the propriety of the appointment being made at the recommendation of the lord lieutenant, or rather of the custos rotulorum; to whom the recommendation, in fact, belongs. But it is not possible for any authority in this metropolis to appoint justices of the peace for distant places, without the recommendation of some local authority: and it does appear to me, that the nobleman who is custos rotulorum, being generally also lord lieutenant, is the most unexceptionable officer we can have to give such a recommendation. The duty must be devolved on some local authority, and I think no better than that of the custus rotulorum can be devised. If the opinion of one gentleman or nobleman, responsible like a lord lieutenant, could be obtained, in the
<col>254</col>
recommendation of magistrates for Ireland, that would, I think, be much better than the present method, by which the lord chancellor of Ireland has to collect the opinions of several individuals. Any member of the Privy Council may recommend us a gentleman as justice of peace in Ireland. Formerly, the lord chancellor asked the members of the county to recommend justices; but that practice is altered, and I am disposed to think, as we must have the recommendation of some local authority, that no better than that of the lord lieutenant and custos rotulorum can be devised.<lb/>
With respect to the licensing system, to which the learned gentleman has referred, he does not seem to be aware that a bill was brought into this House last session, though it was not passed, for checking abuses in that system. It is generally found, I believe, that the abuses of that system are more prevalent in large towns and in their neighbourhood. The brewers, at least, generally reside in large towns; and there lies their influence. Now, one of the provisions of the bill, to which I have alluded, was to provide a remedy for this evil; which it did by giving, wherever the magistrates of such towns had an exclusive jurisdiction, the county magistrates a concurrent jurisdiction, as far as licensing was concerned. I admit, that the system requires correction; and the bill of last session was only postponed to give a fuller opportunity of discussing the measure and finding out the best means of facilitating justice, by introducing publicity into the licensing system.<lb/>
The learned member, Sir, has referred to one of the bills which I introduced last session, which regulates the fees of the magistrates' clerks, and which he accuses of adding to contention. That bill gave direct authority to the magistrates on the bench to refuse costs in cases of assault. I abstained from giving expenses in cases of assault, precisely because I would not encourage frivolous proceedings. If it be right to give costs in cases of rape, I see no reason why they should not be given in cases of attempt at rape. The distinction which formerly existed was between felony and misdemeanour; and the bill gave authority to the magistrates to allow parties their expenses in such cases of misdemeanour as they might think fit. I have heard no complaints of that law. If
<image src="S2V0018P0I0135"/>
<col>255</col>
I had, I should have no objection to have it altered.<lb/>
I have heard, Sir, with satisfaction, that all the bills which I introduced have worked well; and I hold in my hand the five acts which I introduced comprised in one small volume; and it contains not only an enumeration of all the acts which those five acts repealed, but the substance of what was before spread over one hundred and thirty acts of parliament. In this, Sir, I find great encouragement to proceed; and I do not despair of effecting great good of the same kind, from seeing the small compass into which those hundred and thirty acts have been compressed. With the exception of the observation of the learned gentleman, I have never heard the least complaint of those five acts. They have now been in operation for nine months, and they have not given rise to any doubts concerning their meaning. I was told at the Home office, during the administration of lord Lansdowne, that no complaints had been made, and that there was nothing in those laws which called for correction. I say this, not taking credit to myself, but giving it to those gentlemen who were employed about the technical parts of the bills, and by whom they were, in fact, prepared.<lb/>
The learned gentleman has also referred to the appeals from the magistrates. To his observations on this point, I reply that I gave the power of appeal from all convictions by one magistrate, however small the sum; and I gave a power of appeal from the decision of two, whenever the fine amounted to 5<i>l</i>., or the term of imprisonment exceeded one month. I have been desirous to make these few observations, Sir, on the more popular parts of the learned gentleman's statement. The remainder of his observations, relating to real property, and to the various legal points connected with it, is so full of technical details, that I am not prepared to enter into a consideration of it, and I wish to avoid pledging myself&#x2014;I wish the House to abstain from pledging itself&#x2014;to come to any conclusion, until after a few days consideration. It is necessary to take time for consideration before we can decide which are the most important points, in the many things to which the learned gentleman has alluded, for a commission to take up. If every thing mentioned by the learned gentleman were to be referred to a commission, I am inclined
<col>256</col>
to think that his object would not be obtained; for a commission would be confused and overwhelmed by the multiplicity of the objects. The learned gentleman has evidently brought forward his motion, not with the view to subvert, but to improve the law; he has taken the wise course of pointing out its evils,' many of which I do not deny, and he seeks a practical remedy. The manner in which he has brought forward his motion is well calculated to gain favour for his proposition: but, before I agree to it, I wish to have time to consult those who, from their station and attainments, are best qualified to judge&#x2014;I mean the lord Chancellor and the Attorney-general; and I trust the learned gentleman will give us a few days to take into our consideration the various subjects which he has brought before the House. If he then finds that we are not prepared to go his length, he may appeal to the House. I can assure the learned gentleman, that in asking for delay, I do not wish to defeat his object, nor to deprive him of that honest fame which is due to him for having originated such a motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00205"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, that after so long and so laborious a speech as that which the House had just heard, it was but reasonable that time should be given for considering the various topics referred to. His object in rising was merely to enter into a short explanation. With respect to the appeals before the Privy Council, the reason why a greater number were not disposed of was, because there were no agents or parties before the Privy Council, whom they could hear. Now this, he apprehended, arose from the different manner in which appeals from the inferior courts of Judicature to the superior were disposed of in this country and in India. The course pursued in India was in every respect more summary than in this country. In India, the cause was removed altogether from the inferior to the superior court, the whole being embodied in the written pleadings and arguments of counsel, and out of these the court of Appeal made it a practice never to travel, without calling for any fresh lights upon the subject, whether the judgment given was right or wrong. Perhaps the inhabitants of India were a little disappointed that the same course was not pursued here in this country. Indeed he had reason to know that some discontent had been felt upon
<image src="S2V0018P0I0136"/>
<col>257</col>
that subject. But that such proceedings were in themselves a grievance, whether originating in ignorance or mistake, nobody could deny, and the sooner they were remedied the better. The attention of the Privy Council had been called to the subject, and a proposition had been made for the appointment of an officer, whose duty it would be, in all cases where there was no special agent, to conduct the cause, examine the papers, extract cases for the opinion of counsel, employ counsel, and by bringing the matters before the Privy Council, to obtain final judgment upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00206"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, he should be sorry to be understood as wishing to cast any reflections upon the Privy Council. Of the distinguished persons who attended there as professional judges, he was bound to speak in terms of the highest respect; and of the present Master of the Rolls, in particular, he would say, that there never was a man more anxious to do his duty with despatch. So it was before his time; for he had no objection to make against lord Gifford, or sir John Copley; and still less to sir William Grant, one of the greatest judges that this country ever produced. But the difficulty, known only to professional men, was, that you could not get judges and counsel together more than about eight or nine times a year. The Privy Council had no bar of its own. However numerous the appeals might be, they were obliged to await the convenience of the few who practised in the court. Of these, about four attended from the court of Chancery, and the same number from the King's-bench; but when those courts sat, these gentlemen could not attend. There was scarcely any thing done before the Privy Council, except upon holydays, such as the 30th of January, the Purification, or a few such days. Surely this was a state of things which ought not to continue. These appeal causes were of the greatest importance, few of them involving property under from 50 to 60,000<i>l</i>. Four years and a half was the average time that a cause took, from its being entered until its final decision. Now, how very beneficial it would be to the suitors, if, like the House of Lords, which now disposed of a Scotch appeal in six months, the Privy Council could be brought to use something like similar despatch. Upon an average of twelve years there had been only nine sittings a year; so that, with all the desire
<col>258</col>
which the judges and counsel felt to do their duty, it was out of their power to do justice to the suitors. With respect to the adjournment, he could have no objection to it. He was not so weak as to imagine that the House would take all his statements upon his showing, without due consideration. Of the mischief there was no doubt; as to the remedy, that he left to the wisdom of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SAVINGS BANKS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00208"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to call the attention of the House to a subject of considerable importance. He was anxious to move for certain returns, in continuation of former returns, with a view of showing the enormous expense at which Savings Banks were maintained by the public. He was one of the earliest and most active in promoting them, and therefore he could not be actuated by any hostile view in his present proceeding. He must, however, candidly state, that when he promoted the establishment of Savings Banks he did not expect that they would cost the country half a million sterling for their maintenance. He expected that such institutions would pay their own expense, and that the poor man would, by their means, be enabled to invest his ten, twenty, or fifty pounds, with as much security as the rich. He had never contemplated that they were to receive a larger interest than what the public creditor received. It was high time that the subject should be inquired into. Up to the 5th January 1827, the amount paid by the public was 432,080<i>l.</i> Since the year 1817, government had received, for interest of money invested 2,350,000<i>l.</i>, and had paid for deposits 2,750,000<i>l.</i> Thus there was a loss of nearly half a million. His object was, to bring before the House the accounts to the 5th January 1828. If these establishments were to be upheld at an expense of 40,000<i>l.</i> or 50,000<i>l.</i> a year, he would rather the government had the superintendence of them, that there might be some responsibility or check. He would move, "That there be laid before the House an Account of the gross amount of all sums, received and paid by the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt, on account

<title>STATE OF IRELAND.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00209"><member>The Earl of Darnley</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to put a question to the noble duke opposite, with respect to a subject of the greatest importance. He need scarcely add, that he alluded to the State of Ireland. Notwithstanding what had passed on a former occasion, when a question had been put to the noble duke, to know whether it was in the contemplation of ministers to realize a report which had been spread abroad, that though his majesty's government were averse to granting the whole of what the Roman Catholics asked for, it was intended to grant some part,&#x2014;notwithstanding that the noble duke had answered, that his majesty's government had no intention of adopting any such measure, still he could not suppose but that the noble duke must be convinced, that Ireland was in a very unsatisfactory and alarming state. He, therefore, wished to know if it was the intention of ministers to bring forward any proposition relating to that country? Though he was persuaded, that nothing effectual could be done without granting concessions to the Catholics, still he hoped that something might be done to alleviate the unfortunate condition of Ireland. If the noble duke should state, that there was no intention on the part of the government to bring forward any measure, he should then feel it his duty, in pursuance of the notice which he had given last session, to move for a committee to inquire into the state of the population of Ireland, to see what measures can be adopted for its amelioration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00210"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> said, he felt as much anxiety with regard to the situation of Ireland, as any noble lord present; but he had no intention of bringing forward any measure of the description alluded to by the noble earl. There would be measures brought forward in the course of the session, in the other House; but the measures contemplated by his friends and colleagues were not those which the noble earl had in contemplation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TURKEY AND GREECE&#x2014;BATTELE OF NAVARIN &#x2014; MINISTERIAL EXPLANATIONS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00211">The order of the day being read,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00212"><member>The Earl of Carnarvon</member><membercontribution> said, it was with great regret that he stated to their lordships that his noble friend (lord Holland) who had given notice of a motion for today was, through indisposition, unable to attend. His noble friend had four motions ready, which he had intended to move that day. All those motions were more or less connected with the question of our relations with Turkey, and the measures taken by the government of this country relative to the affairs of Greece. Two of those motions were such only as tended to illustrate the views of his noble friend respecting the nature of our relations with Turkey. Those questions it was not his intention to touch upon, leaving to his noble friend, on his recovery, to use his own discretion in bringing them forward. The other two which he intended to submit to their lordships, were merely motions for additional papers, to enable their lordships to make a fair estimate of the policy of this country; which he was convinced it was impossible for their lordships to do, relying solely on the papers which had been laid before them. Another object of these motions&#x2014;no less important than the former&#x2014;was to obtain additional information, that we might pay the debt which was due to our gallant officers engaged in the battle of Navarin: for although the country was fairly, fully, and perfectly satisfied with their meritorious conduct, from reading the newspapers and the gazette, which communicated the intelligence of that battle, yet their lordships were far from possessing that information which would enable them to know what were the instructions given to the commanders of the combined fleet, or whether those instructions were well or ill carried into execution. He was sure that every noble lord would agree with him when he stated, that there was no object which Englishmen had more at heart, than to give to every gallant officer&#x2014;and in this instance the officer was one of the best and bravest in the service&#x2014;the opportunity of clearing up any insinuations which might have been thrown out against his character, and of removing any surmise, that his conduct was not as satisfactory to the existing government as it was to the late administration, to the country at large, and to his Sovereign, who had
<image src="S2V0018P0I0138"/>
<col>261</col>
testified his approbation of his conduct by conferring honours upon him. With respect to both these objects, he was sure their lordships would see the necessity for further information. The information which he intended to move for would be, in the first instance, for a copy of the instructions which had been sent by the combined powers to each of the officers commanding the allied fleet, which had been signed by the ambassadors of each power at London. After that, he should move, with a view to ascertain how the officers had acted upon those instructions, for copies of any communication or despatch relative to the circumstances which preceded the battle of Navarin, which may have been previously or subsequently to that event received from admiral Codrington, or any other officer. He could not anticipate any difficulty which government could feel to lay before the House both those communications, but he would say, that if they were withheld, the country and the House would be left in a most awkward, embarrassing, and unsatisfactory situation, with respect to circumstances of the utmost importance.&#x2014;The only part of the policy of his majesty's government upon which their lordships were enabled to form any thing like a judgment from the papers laid before them, was merely as to the right, in the first instance, and next as to the policy, of interfering at all between the Greeks and the Turks. With a view to come to an opinion upon that subject, their lordships had sufficient information in the protocol, the treaty, and the additional article to the treaty, which were the whole of the documents before them. There were some persons who maintained, that no case can be made out to justify or to excuse an interference with the internal policy of foreign nations. To that opinion, thus broadly laid down, he could not accede. Upon the propriety of non-interference he felt much less strongly than other persons, whose opinions he considered of great weight; but still he thought that the history of all times, and of our country, teemed with examples in which such interpositions had taken place. In the instance of interposition between the Greeks and Turks, two grounds for such interposition might be assumed; either that of right or of expediency. But if it were contended that admitting, as the treaty states, that horrors disgraceful to humanity were perpetrated, still it ought
<col>262</col>
not to be permitted to the governments in Europe, having the power and the means to put an end to those horrors, to do so, but that they should be compelled to tolerate them to infinity&#x2014;such an abstract principle he never could admit. But, if their lordships considered that the effect of a contracted conflict between two powers on all the countries around, would be to familiarize mankind to scenes of horror, that was a further reason for bringing those horrors to an end. This was one of the grounds which justified a case of interposition; and he thought that, in the case of Greece, a sufficient case had been made out, on behalf of suffering humanity, to call upon the great powers to interpose. There was, however, in all cases of interposition, a danger to be apprehended. Pretences were often made to carry into execution plans of ambition, in the name of suffering humanity. But what was the situation of the government of this country? The government found that those powers which would have had the means of availing themselves, for such views of ambition, of the distracted state of the belligerent country, were willing to waive all such views, and to unite cordially, in a league with the government of this country, to interpose to the extent of restoring tranquillity, and with a complete abstinence of all pursuits of ambition.&#x2014;The next question was one of great importance, and which had occurred in all ages and countries; namely, as to the right and policy of interference, whenever our interest was affected, directly or indirectly, by the continuation of a distracted state of things in another country. It was a very short time&#x2014;only a few hours&#x2014;since his noble friend had informed him of his inability to attend, and had requested him to move for that information which he had intended to move for himself. At so short a notice, it had been impossible for him to look far back, or to consult any thing beyond the page of history. It did occur to him, however, that there must be many instances similar to the present, of interference in the behalf of the unfortunate subjects of other countries, proceeding from the cause of the difference of religion. Looking back to that glorious period of our history, the reign of Elizabeth, he found many instances of interference with the internal policy of foreign nations, by-granting supplies, and even by invasion, by landing troops, and by carrying on
<image src="S2V0018P0I0139"/>
<col>263</col>
military operations in foreign countries, in aid of the revolted subjects of other powers, while we remained in amity and peace with them, and in an alliance stronger than that which existed with Turkey; and while the ambassadors of those powers were in London, and the English ambassadors at the courts of the respective powers.&#x2014;He would refer to the few instances of interference which he had selected. The first instance which occurred to him was during the minority of Charles 9th of France, three years after the peace which had been concluded by the treaty of Chateau-Cambresis, the terms of which stated, that it should never be lawful for either of the contracting princes to give protection to the rebellious subjects of the other, but that they should deliver them up to their respective masters. Here was a treaty, by which the contracting parties were specifically bound to give up the revolted subjects of each other. It was in 1562, three years subsequent to that treaty, that the Prince of Cond&#x00E9;, heading a rebellion against the government of his country, applied to Elizabeth for succour. That queen assisted him, by the grant of 100,000 crowns and 6,000 infantry. Those troops landed in France, and remained there during the military operations and unsuccessful campaign of the Prince of Cond&#x00E9;, and, during all that time, England continued in peace with France. Another instance occurred in 1585, at which time Elizabeth sent troops to the amount of 6,000, as well as arms and money, to the assistance of the Huguenots, while she remained during the whole period at peace with the court of Spain. Another case of interposition was that of the Low Countries. The Low Countries, owing to religious differences, had revolted from the crown of Spain&#x2014;from the dominion of their legitimate prince; for there could be no question as to his legitimacy. They were people fighting for their religious freedom, and precisely in the same situation as the Greeks. Here we found that, in 1568, a Spanish squadron, laden with a good deal of money, being pursued by some French privateers, took refuge in an English harbour. The money with which the ships were laden was intended for the duke of Alva, in order to enable him to continue with effect the war against the insurgents. As soon as Elizabeth discovered that fact, she actually intercepted the money; and, though re-
<col>264</col>
peatedly asked to give it up by the Spanish ambassador, refused to deliver it out of her hands. In 1578, troops were raised in England for the service of the Romanists, though Elizabeth had actually entered into a treaty with the Prince of the Netherlands. A manifesto was soon after published, stating that the alliance between the kings of England and the Prince of the Netherlands was not so much between persons as between states; and, from those words, Elizabeth drew the inference, that she might assist the inhabitants of the Low Countries, without infringing that treaty. That, then, was a treaty of alliance; and, in stating these facts, he was merely calling to the recollection of their lordships circumstances which were known to them; namely, that during those periods it was the practice and the policy of this country to support, in different parts of Europe, the revolted subjects of other powers against their legitimate sovereigns; and, in one instance, to which he had alluded, where she was bound by a treaty&#x2014;something more like an alliance than could be proved to exist with Turkey&#x2014;to deliver the rebellious subjects up to their sovereign.&#x2014;There were, at various times, instances of interposition. We were ourselves the victims of the application of this principle. Upon one memorable occasion, when Mr. Pitt was in power, he had always heard the policy of this government commended. He alluded to the policy of this country, in conjunction with Prussia, with respect to the revolution in Holland, which took place in 1787, when that revolution was put an end to by the sudden march of the duke of Brunswick against Amsterdam. That act of policy had been greatly admired; for it really had become a question, whether this country should endeavour to maintain her connexion with Holland, or allow that connexion to be transferred to France, out of whose influence that revolution had arisen. He had always heard that act praised as being one of the wisest acts of Mr. Pitt's administration. The history of Europe, since those years, had been full of instances of interference with the internal government of foreign states. Whatever, therefore, might be our feelings respecting the policy of interference in the Greek question, the facts of precedents and of usage were established; and upon a question between right and usage, how could we hope, by our
<image src="S2V0018P0I0140"/>
<col>265</col>
black-letter law, to bring the question to a decision? It might be contended, that the principle of non-interference ought not to be departed from, and their lordships might concur in it; but, if we did that, we should do still better by getting rid of all alliances, shutting ourselves up within our own circle, and letting all other countries go to ruin. If we were, however, to interfere in the affairs of Europe, we must be guided by policy, and by those principles so often and so signally recognized and asserted. The broad principle of non-interference should, he would admit, be the foundation of all treaties between foreign powers; but he would contend, that it ought to be relaxed, should imperious circumstances demand it. The principle of the Holy Alliance had been that of interference; but it had been uniformly exerted, not to put down anarchy, its professed object, but to crush all attempts at establishing free and liberal institutions. Was that a species of interference that ought to be applauded, while an interference with a contrary object was to be Condemned? Let their lordships look to the proceedings of the Holy Alliance, and to the present case of interference. They would find this difference between them; the interference of the Holy Alliance had been uniformly directed to put down the liberties of nations, the other was for the purpose of raising a people dear to us, not only from associations of old recollections, but from the brave and wonderful resistance which they had opposed to their oppressors. He thought he had now proved enough&#x2014;in establishing, that the practice of interference on behalf of suffering humanity, was not an innovation for which no precedent could be produced, but that it had long been known to European policy. It only remained for him to show whether or not the principle had, in the present instance, been wisely applied. It might be said, that the instances of interference on the part of this country, which he had mentioned, were such as suited her policy. They were, however, instances of danger to this country: but what danger could arise from the state of Turkey? Now, he never would admit that Turkey and Greece formed no part of the balance of Europe. There was a time when they did not. Russia also formed a great and most important part of the balance of Europe. It was a state neighbouring on Turkey,
<col>266</col>
powerful from its extent and position. Now, he would ask whether any one could have looked without anxiety at the state of the Turkish empire&#x2014;could have seen the distracted condition of that country, and not have felt that the balance of power in the east of Europe was in danger of being broken from hour to hour. Not only had civil war endured for a long period on land, but it had been prosecuted at sea with extraordinary vigour. Could noble lords believe that such a state of things was not calculated to affect the interests of every nation in Europe? Could any one suppose that such a state of things would not give rise to violations of neutrality, and occasion a war, not between one or two powers, but the greater part of Europe? The wise policy of the English government had; been, to unite in a common treaty three powers, which, perhaps, had never before been so long or so cordially united, or with so much fairness and sincerity, for the purpose of interposing between Turkey and Greece&#x2014;not for the dismembering of that empire&#x2014;not with the same views as three great powers had interposed in the affairs of Poland&#x2014;but to lay aside, in the event of war, all excuses and pretences for aggrandizement, and direct their united efforts to restore tranquillity, and to give an opportunity of prolonging the peace, which, from the state of the Turkish empire, was likely to be disturbed. The only question between those who Condemned, and those who approved of the present act of interference was, whether the step which had been taken was more likely to involve the great powers of Europe in a conflict, or to prevent such a danger. Let their lordships look to the policy of Russia, to its position, and then ask themselves, whether it were possible that such a civil war should exist in Turkey for any length of time without a military interference. Let them consider, that the Greek religion existed through the Russian dominions; and, if Turkey should wage war against that religion, was it in the nature of man that the Russians should remain calm spectators of the destruction&#x2014;he had almost said annihilation&#x2014;of the Greeks? He felt rather surprised at their long forbearance; but, when in so peaceful a temper, and with such moderation, the Russians invited this country to put an end to the wretched state of affairs which existed in Greece, giving us assurances that they
<image src="S2V0018P0I0141"/>
<col>267</col>
would act in conjunction with us for one common object, would it not have been something more than folly, if this country had refused to accede to the proposal?&#x2014;if we had said to the Russians, "we will not countenance your proposition&#x2014;we protest against the proceeding&#x2014;we will not act in concert with you&#x2014;we will not be bound by any treaties&#x2014;we leave Turkey to be occupied by you, as Spain is by France?" Ought this country, having the means offered her of objecting to any aggrandizement on the part of Russia, to have neglected the opportunity, and left herself without any right to call hereafter upon Russia to restore to freedom and independence whatever countries she might have enslaved? Ought we to have left Russia irritated at our policy, and ready to act single-handed&#x2014;which must have been the case, according to all experience, before many years had passed? It could not be doubted, from the character of the Russians, that feelings would burst forth which governments cannot always control, and to which the Russian government must pay attention. No one could believe that that government could long have kept inactive the people of that country, connected as they are with the Greeks by religious ties, and for whom they feel a common interest.&#x2014;It appearing, however, from the treaty before their lordships, that we had adopted the broad principle to which he had referred, he now wished for the production of other documents, to ascertain whether or not the government of this country had followed it up by sending out such instructions to the Mediterranean as were calculated to give it effect. It was with this view that he meant to move for copies of those instructions. He trusted it would be found from them, that the most cordial measures had been adopted to promote the object of this alliance. He also asked for the production of these papers, because he felt that the whole people of England took the deepest interest in the subject. It was not unnatural that they should entertain an anxious desire to have the fullest explanation of a case, in which such a strange difference existed between the manner in which it was treated by the government of France, and the dull phraseology, the "untoward" language applied to it by the present administration of this country. He was aware that the House had been told, at the commencement of the session, by
<col>268</col>
he noble field-marshal who was placed at the head of the government, that the treaty entered into must be fulfilled; but their lordships well knew, that there was a material difference between acting upon a treaty with determination and energy, and adopting such a cold, hesitating, feeble line of conduct, as would render that treaty little better than a dead letter. Undoubtedly, the language of ministers induced an apprehension&#x2014;it might be a peculiarity in their style&#x2014;of a virtual, if not actual, dissolution of this treaty. In that case, it was only to the co-operation of France and Russia that we had to look for the realization of those hopes respecting Greece, which were so ardently entertained; but if Russia found that England manifested a cold compliance with the obligation of the treaty, he feared she would soon adopt such a line of policy as this country would long have occasion to rue. These were the feelings which led him to ask for information on this subject. He was aware that he could have obtained a complete explanation, from his noble friend (the marquis of Lansdowne) near him, so far as regarded the period during which he had been in office; but the noble marquis could not inform him of what had taken place subsequently; he could not explain the causes which led to the cold phraseology to which he had before alluded. For this explanation, therefore, he must look to his noble friend opposite. His noble friend, who had been the friend of Mr. Canning, and who was now the colleague of Mr. Canning's bitter opponent, could give him all the information he required; for he had formed part of the late administration, and of the administration which preceded that, and he was now happy in forming a part of the noble duke's administration. His noble friend had been lately advanced in a new character, and one in which the country took a deep interest; namely, a guarantee for the fulfilment of the treaty. The noble earl was the residuary devisee of his departed friend's political principles; he had maintained, both at home and abroad, the liberal policy of Mr. Canning. To him, therefore, the country looked for the perfect fulfilment of this measure. His noble friend had filled an important character in the recent union which had taken place: their lordships had heard much of the language of a <i>cestui-que-trust</i>&#x2014;they now saw that this <i>cestui-que-trust</i>&#x2014; this great
<image src="S2V0018P0I0142"/>
<col>269</col>
guarantee, had been powerful to effect much; for he had caused two members of the late administration who could not sit together in the same cabinet, to take their places side by side without any danger of violence. He supposed these two right hon. gentlemen were bound over to keep the peace towards each other. Was his noble friend also their surety for that purpose? It was, however, to the noble earl and his friends that the country must direct their hopes of the present government, that it may not again fall into what was called the Liverpool administration. He supported the last administration, and that of Mr. Canning which preceded it, because he felt that they were the most remote in principle from that of lord Liverpool. He had therefore hailed them as the dawn of better feeling: but now the old rampant creature threatened to revive; the snake had been scotched, not killed. He saw that all that had taken place in the cabinet had only been contrived for the purpose of getting rid of a few independent Whig members who, by being placed there, prevented the two parts of the Liverpool worm from re-uniting. There was, in reality, no pretence for the change which had taken place in the ministry. With respect to lord Liverpool, he entertained the greatest esteem for that unfortunate nobleman; but towards the thing called the Liverpool principle, he entertained the opposite feeling. If such principles were again to prevail, their lordships would again have green bags upon their table, and red coats at the next popular meeting. But perhaps they could look to the "guarantee" for preservation from these principles, if he would but come forward and state fairly, that he had accepted a pledge for the continuance of that policy which he had previously maintained. He was most desirous for this avowal; for he looked with great anxiety to this guarantee, and wished to know what the country had to expect at his hands. He did not know if this ministry would follow the examples set them last year; but he dared to say there were many who now wished that much of what was said last year was unuttered. He did not wish to know why the viscount (Goderich) had resigned his most important office &#x2014; whether the communication was oral, or by letter, or merely contained in a postscript. He trusted, nevertheless, that the noble viscount would explain to the House, con-
<col>270</col>
duct which he was, no doubt, well able to defend. He knew that noble viscount's character well, and respected it highly, and was sure that what he had done was done with a view to the welfare of his country. He would now move for "Copies of all Instructions to the Admirals of the Combined Fleets in the Mediterranean, agreed upon by the British, French, and Russian Plenipotentiaries, and transmitted to the said Admirals between the 6th of July, and the 20th of October, 1827." He should follow this motion up by another, for certain explanatory documents preceding the battle of Navarin, to the production of which he presumed, there would be no objection, as he only called for papers which had been transmitted to Constantinople. Some further despatches may also have been received from sir E. Codrington, subsequent to the battle, which, for his own sake, and for the sake of the service, ought to be laid upon the table. Every thing ought to be freely supplied, that could place the conduct of that, gallant officer in the clearest and most honourable light.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00213"><member>Earl Dudley</member><membercontribution> said, he feared he should disappointment the expectation of his noble friend, when he stated that it was not his intention to follow him through the various topics upon which he had dilated, and through which he had presumed, somewhat too hastily, that it was his duty to follow him. What he had to say would relate chiefly to the demand for the papers which his noble friend had called for. His noble friend had urged, as a principal reason for their production, that they were necessary to the vindication of the gallant admiral who commanded at Navarin and the officers who served under him. His answer to that was, that the character that was not attacked required no defence. Admiral Codrington, so far from having his conduct attacked by his majesty's government, had received distinguished rewards at their hands. He therefore stood in no need of vindication from them. If his conduct had been criticised by those who had no just grounds for judging of it, that was not a reason why his majesty's ministers should make out a defence for him, by the production of papers, which, for grave political reasons, it was inexpedient to produce. Besides, even if there were no objection to the production of these papers, others would be required in illustration of them; for they could only be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0143"/>
<col>271</col>
rendered intelligible by the production of the communications which had passed between our Ambassador at Constantinople, and the Allied Powers; while these, again, would lead to the necessity of producing others which, under present circumstances, it would be highly inexpedient to produce. It was rather too much, therefore, to ask for documents of this description, when not even an opinion was called for from parliament on the subject to which they referred. In this instance the government of this country was acting in concert with its allies; and they were therefore bound not to betray their confidence. If it had been the object of noble lords to take these affairs out of the hands of the government, and disclose their secrets to those who were most disposed to counteract their views, their lordships could not adopt a mode better calculated to effect that object, than by insisting on the production of these papers. If their lordships considered the Executive government incompetent to adopt and conduct those measures which were most fit to be adopted, then the proper course to pursue would be, not to call upon them to disclose state secrets, but to ask his majesty to transfer to other hands, unbroken, the confidence which had been reposed in theirs. It had been said, that there could be no reason for withholding this information from the people of this country, after it had been communicated to other states. The fact was, that a very small portion of these documents had been so communicated: the great mass of them remained undisclosed. These were the reasons which he had to offer for not acceding to the motion of his noble friend.&#x2014;There was one other point, in the speech of his noble friend, to which, although he had no intention of entering into any of its details, he would briefly advert. His noble friend, in alluding to the change which had recently taken place in the administration of the country, had insinuated, that between those who remained in office and those who joined them, some sacrifice of principle had taken place, and he had asked what stipulations had been made? Stipulations there were none. If, indeed, there was so little honour or confidence amongst them, that it was necessary to stipulate for each other's principles, they would be, in his opinion, most unfit to act together. No stipulations, therefore, he repeated, had been entered
<col>272</col>
into between them. But if his noble friend asked whether there existed amongst them a fair understanding as to all matters of general policy, he replied directly, and decidedly, Yes.&#x2014;With regard to the observations of his noble friend respecting the treaty, he could assure him that it was the intention of his majesty's ministers that it should be executed&#x2014;fully executed. It was never intended" to keep the word of promise to the ear, and break it to the hope." It was meant to be fulfilled, in spirit, as well as to the letter. His understanding upon this subject was, that this treaty, as far as depended on this country, was to be fulfilled in the spirit of peace and conciliation: the object of it being to establish the pacification of Greece; and in that spirit it would be the duty of his majesty's government to carry it into full effect. He knew of no shrinking from that duty, on the part of any member of the government to which he had the honour to belong; nor had he any reason to believe, that, in their mode of fulfilling it, there would be any falling off in the present government from the preceding one. These were all the observations he had to make in reply to the speech of his noble friend. He had endeavoured to express himself shortly in the most satisfactory manner he could. But when his noble friend called upon him to go at large into all the details and circumstances connected with that treaty, he must beg to decline doing so now: this was not the fit time for entering into them. The proper period, however, would arrive; and he would then&#x2014;should he still have the honour to hold the office which he now filled &#x2014;go into as ample and as detailed an explanation as his noble friend could desire. It was not because he was afraid of being unable to give the most satisfactory explanation of every circumstance that he declined doing so now, but because he did not think it was either fit, or wise, or seemly, to go into the facts relative to that treaty at the present moment. Whenever the proper time came, he would not shrink from it; but he trusted he had said enough to convince the House, that he ought not at present to comply with the motion of his noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00214"><member>Lord Goderich</member><membercontribution> said&#x2014;If, my lords, I feel myself compelled to offer myself to your lordships' notice at this early period of the debate, I have to offer as an apology that the noble earl who has introduced the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0144"/>
<col>273</col>
motion before the House, having alluded to the circumstances which produced the late change in his majesty's government, imposes it upon me as a duty which I owe to my own honour, to your lordships, and to the country at large, which always takes an interest in the character of any individual, however humble, who has taken a part in its government. I owe it to my own character to explain the grounds upon which I acted on that occasion, and which led to that change in the administration to which the noble earl has alluded. In rising, however, to discharge this duty, I feel that I have to solicit the indulgence of the House, because I am about to withdraw your lordships' attention from the more leading and important subject, which my noble friend has brought before you. Undoubtedly, the more immediate cause which led to the recent change, was the irreconcilable difference of opinion, upon a subject of the deepest moment to the country, between two individuals, members of that government, holding situations of the highest importance in the administration of public affairs [cheers from the marquis of Lansdowne]. My noble friend manifestly understands the circumstances to which I allude. And I will take the present opportunity of stating, although it does not, perhaps, belong immediately to this part of my subject, that, so far as regards the conduct of my noble friend, in the situation which he held, I never had to deal with a man whose character stood higher for honour, for fair dealing, for candour, for conciliation of manner, or for a straightforward disposition in the pursuit of the welfare and interests of his country [hear]. I am almost ashamed to speak in these terms of my noble friend in his presence; but I am forced, in justice, to say thus much.<lb/>
It must be in the recollection of your lordships, that in the course of the last session, the late Mr. Canning announced to the other House of parliament, that it was the intention of his majesty's government to propose, in the course of the present session, the appointment of a committee of finance. That measure had attracted much of my consideration, and had I remained in the discharge of the duties which had theretofore devolved upon me when in the other House, I should have felt it necessary to submit a proposition of that nature to my colleagues for their consideration. It is not necessary
<col>274</col>
for me to trouble your lordships with an exposition of the reasons which led me to think that there were circumstances in the finances of the country which rendered such a measure desirable. Suffice it to say, in the present instance, that I did think so, and thinking so, I considered that the measure ought to be pursued with an honest and a zealous determination to render it effectual for its purpose. It would have been my duty, concurrently with my two right hon. friends, when I succeeded most unworthily&#x2014;and I will add most unfortunately, in some respects&#x2014;to the head of the government last year, to have prepared for the introduction of such a measure. I am now alluding to what would have been my duty had I retained that elevated situation; when I should, in concert with my right hon. friend, the then chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;our situations being those to which the regulation of the finances of the country more immediately belonged&#x2014;to submit to our colleagues in office, first, the general situation of the public finances; and then, as connected with that subject, the important question of the finance committee, and the mode in which that committee was to be constructed. It did so happen, however, that when the time arrived at which some measure of this nature was contemplated, in the month of November, so many circumstances had arisen, connected with our relations with foreign powers, that it was impossible for me to be prepared to submit to my colleagues any definite or satisfactory view of the subject. It is true, indeed, that the situation of Portugal was then becoming every day more and more settled; and there was every ground of satisfaction and congratulation to every well-wisher of this country and of that; and every reason for hoping that the time was not far distant when it would be competent for the government of this country to withdraw the troops which had been sent to Portugal. It was still, however, uncertain when that desirable event could be accomplished; and when we looked at our external affairs elsewhere, just at that crisis, it must be obvious to all who are conversant with their import, that we were not sure we could altogether escape the perils of war. It was impossible, therefore, under these circumstances for me to ascertain the extent of the demand which it would be necessary for the government to make upon the country, to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0145"/>
<col>275</col>
maintain those establishments which must necessarily be regulated by the state of our external connexions, as well as by the domestic exigencies of the state. That being the case, I was disabled from laying before my colleagues any precise and comprehensive measure respecting the finances of the country, but the question was not therefore out of my mind, or the minds of those who acted with me. In the course of that cordial, friendly and familiar intercourse, which must necessarily be carried on between those who act in office together, and who are not suspicious or jealous of each other&#x2014;and for my part, I discovered no symptoms of suspicion or jealousy, and I believe my noble friend on my right will confirm me in this [hear, hear &#x0021; from the marquis of Lansdowne]&#x2014; in the course of that friendly and familiar intercourse, which certainly did take place, it was intimated to me by a member of the cabinet, that it would be desirable if there were placed in the chair of the finance committee an individual of the other House who was considered by all who knew him as eminently qualified for the duties which the appointment would impose. As far as regarded that individual, I have long known him, and I entertain a sincere and high regard for him. I know him to be a man of the highest honour, the most incorruptible integrity; and, as a man of business, I know him to be intimately conversant with all those points which would necessarily come under the consideration of the finance committee. It was therefore impossible that I should have felt any personal objection to the appointment of that individual: but, as the matter had not come regularly before the government, but was stated to me merely in a casual and incidental manner, I did not feel myself then called upon to express any other opinion than this&#x2014;that as the question was one which rested especially with the House of Commons, whatever appointment the members of the cabinet in that House should make I should be satisfied with, and acquiesce in. The matter was not placed before me for my consideration in any thing like an official way, not as at a ministerial conference, but under the circumstances which I have stated, as a mere matter of accidental conversation. It did however, happen, without my being aware, at the time, that such a step had been taken, that a communication was made, not with any view of pledging the
<col>276</col>
government, at least, as I afterwards understood&#x2014;that a communication was made to the individual in question, for the purpose of ascertaining whether, if the government should be disposed to recommend his nomination as chairman of the committee, he would undertake the duty. This communication I beg to say was made, as I have already declared, without my knowledge, and it was also made without the knowledge of one of the members of the government who, from his situation, was more immediately connected with the subject to which it refers; I mean the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Herries) who was then chancellor of the Exchequer. But I ought to add, that from subsequent explanations which were given to me, I understood that the application was not at all made as a settled thing, or in such a manner as to pledge the government and bind them to the appointment. When, however, I learnt that this communication had been made, the result of which was to me, from my personal feeling towards the individual to whom it was made, any thing but unsatisfactory, the first question I asked was, whether any previous communication had been had with my right hon. friend, the chancellor of the Exchequer? I was informed, that there had not been any. I lamented that circumstance&#x2014;I could not but lament it&#x2014;and I imputed it to mere oversight. It seemed to me an unfortunate circumstance that any thing should have passed upon the subject beyond our own immediate circle. I begged that no time might be lost in putting my right hon. friend in possession of what had been done, and in explaining to him the whole of the circumstances. This was done by my right hon. friend, the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Huskisson). He explained to the chancellor of the Exchequer fully all that had occurred upon the subject. No objection was then made by the chancellor of the Exchequer. No offence was taken by him at the time, as far as I have heard, to any thing that had been done. It did, however, so happen, that on the next day&#x2014;after he had had the subject under his consideration&#x2014;my right hon. friend found that there were very strong objections to the proposed appointment which had been so submitted to him. He stated those objections to me; but I understood them to refer much more to the circumstance, of the nomination having been
<image src="S2V0018P0I0146"/>
<col>277</col>
made without his having been consulted, than to the material proposition itself, and that, so placed, he could not accede to it. Various explanations followed, as I have been informed, some of them by letters between my two right hon. friends, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for the Colonies: and I, who never saw this correspondence, was in hopes, for a time, that such explanations had been perfectly satisfactory to all the parties concerned in it. Indeed, so convinced was my right hon. friend, the colonial Secretary that he had succeeded in removing the objections of my right hon. friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that he did not feel it necessary to make me acquainted with the correspondence which had taken place between them both, and the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Tierney) from whom the recommendation originally proceeded. For my own part I was quite convinced, that the explanation had proved entirely satisfactory. There might be differences of opinion, as to the propriety of what had been done: difficulties were to be surmounted, and objections, unquestionably, might be made; but I had no reason to believe, that there was any such difference of opinion as would lead any party concerned to conceive, that if that appointment were persisted in, it would be impossible for the individual objecting to remain any longer a member of the government.<lb/>
These circumstances, your lordships will bear in mind, took place between the latter end of November and the beginning of December; and, on the 22nd of December, I received a letter from my right hon. friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which he first of all stated to me his objections to the mode in which the matter had been discussed, and the negotiation, as he termed it, carried on, and concluded with my sanction, without his knowledge. He then proceeded to state his objections, on public grounds, to the particular nomination; and he concluded by positively informing me, that under these circumstances he felt it his duty, on principle, to place his office of Chancellor of the Exchequer at my disposal, if it were a matter of convenience to me to accept his resignation and put it into any other hands. The conclusion I drew certainly from that letter was, that my right hon. friend tendered the resignation of his place, if the proposed nomination took place. It was utterly impossible not to
<col>278</col>
suppose that that was the obvious meaning of the communication. I felt it to be my duty so to consider it; and every rational man must, I am satisfied, view it in the same light. In answer to my right hon. friend, I stated that he seemed to have greatly misunderstood the degree to which I had been a party to any thing like a settlement of the question, with respect to the chairman of the proposed committee. I explained how the circumstances had arisen, and assured him, there was no ground for saying that an arrangement had been concluded with my sanction, of which in fact I knew nothing until it was over. In reference to the latter part of his letter, I assured my right hon. friend that he was mistaken if he supposed that I could conceive a case in which it would be a convenience to me that he should retire from office; but that at all events, I hoped he would not take any final step, until we should have had an opportunity of giving to the whole question the fullest and most unreserved consideration. I felt it to be my duty to transmit copies of these two letters to my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as he was alluded to in the letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I will not enter into a long detail which would be tedious to your lordships. The result unfortunately was, that while, on the one hand, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, though he was pressed in the strongest manner not to risk that consistency which is the conformation of the government, and though the most earnest endeavours were made to satisfy him that there was no sufficient reason for the objections which he felt to the proposed nomination, always referred to his first letter, which involved his resignation, as the necessary consequence of that appointment. On the other hand, my right hon. friend, the Secretary of State, distinctly and unequivocally declared, not only in conversation, but in writing, that he felt his own honour and character to be so involved in the maintenance of that nomination, that it was utterly impossible that he could acquiesce in any change. The disagreement then, my lords, as I said at the outset, amounted to this: that there was an irreconcileable difference of opinion between two individuals, holding two of the most important and efficient offices in the State, on a question of vital importance to the proper conduct of the official affairs of the kingdom, It was manifest that, as both
<image src="S2V0018P0I0147"/>
<col>279</col>
of these individuals could not remain in the goverment under the circumstances which had occurred, and with the opinions which they avowed, the administration could not go on with the essential business of the country. This was no fault of mine. I did not raise the difficulty. I had no wish, God knows, that the government should not go on. I had no design, such as the noble earl seems to impute, of shaking off a portion of the administration. I declare before God, my desire was to maintain that administration undivided; and let my opinion be what it may upon the cause of difference, no man can think I could descend to so paltry, so base a trick, as to cause differences among my friends in the Cabinet. God knows I have never done so, I tried to heal not to expose differences&#x0021; Need I vindicate myself from the insinuation? I hope not, I am sure not&#x2014;their lordships could not believe it.&#x2014;The noble lord cannot have intended to impute it [hear, hear, from lord Carnarvon]. What was I to do? In what situation was I placed? There was an irreconcileable difference between two of my colleagues. I found&#x2014;painfully found&#x2014;that I could not bring them together. I could not induce either of them to vary his resolution. Under these circumstances, I found it to be my duty to inform his majesty of the situation in which his government stood. I was compelled to make this known. I could not conceal it if I would; and if I had attempted to do so, I should have been guilty of treachery to the king and to the country, and I should have compromised my own honour and that of my colleagues. I thought it my duty, frankly and without reserve, to lay before the king the state in which circumstances had placed the government, at the head of which I had the honour of being placed. His majesty was constitutionally entitled to determine, under these circumstances, what was fit to be done, with a view to the promotion of the interests of the people whom he governed. The decision to which his majesty came was to communicate with the noble duke, who is now at the head of the government, and the result was, that I ceased to hold the situation in which I had the honour to be placed.<lb/>
My lords, I cannot revert to these circumstances without mixed feelings. I avow that I do feel them. I have served my king and country for eighteen years
<col>280</col>
in offices, some of them offices of great trust and responsibility &#x2014; and I am not ashamed to say&#x2014;I feel I am guilty of no arrogance in saying&#x2014;that while I filled the different offices intrusted to me, most of them connected with the most essential and vital interests of the state&#x2014;the duties of these offices were not ill discharged [hear, hear &#x0021;] With respect to the situation I last held, it was one that I can truly say I never coveted. I would not have stirred a step out of my way to have obtained it. I trust I am not destitute of honourable ambition, but at no time have I sought office on personal grounds, nor been induced to retire from it from such motives. When it was proposed to me to succeed Mr. Canning, I felt that I was in a situation in which it was impossible to refuse the offer; not that I could not but be sensible of the immeasurable distance, in point of ability, between that distinguished man and the humble individual who now addresses your lordships. Mr. Canning was not a personal friend of mine. My intercourse with him was purely official; but I entertained the greatest admiration for his public talents, as well as the greatest reverence for his private virtues. He is, unfortunately for his country, now no more. Calumny had been heaped upon his head unsparingly; and had I never spoken to him in the whole course of my life, I could not but have felt some sympathy for his situation, under the load of unmerited obloquy that was heaped upon him [cheers]. For me to have offered myself voluntarily as the successor of such a man would have been a piece of idle vanity&#x2014;a gross absurdity, of which I am not capable: but, when called upon as I was, I knew of no just plea, upon which I could honourably avoid undertaking the responsibility that was assigned to me.<lb/>
My lords, under the circumstances which I have stated, I entered office, and I have since retired from that elevated post, in the manner which I have, I hope, sufficiently explained. In thus retiring, I have secured nothing for myself&#x2014;nothing as regards personal interests, or advantage; but so far as regards honour and character, I feel that I have secured every thing; for I have secured to myself the proud consciousness of having always done my duty to the best of my ability, and the feeling that my honour and character are unassailable. I can truly say that, although I am no longer invested with the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0148"/>
<col>281</col>
attributes of power&#x2014;although I am no longer clothed with the trappings of office, or encumbered with the dangerous trammels of dignity, I shall ever feel an honest and an ardent anxiety to promote, as far as my humble means can do so, the honour and dignity of the Crown, and the happiness and freedom of the people. So far as may be in my power as an independent peer, I shall always be ready to take an humble part in the noble duty&#x2014;for such I consider it&#x2014;of legislating for this great and noble country; and in the performance of that duty, I can take upon me to say, that I shall be as little swayed by motives of personal aggrandizement, as I was when in the more active and ostensible situations in which it has been my lot to be placed; and if it shall be my good fortune to see the government founded upon principles that are honourable and beneficial to the country, and its measures directed by principles of liberality, justice, and discretion, let it be composed of whom it may, it shall have my best wishes for its success. We live, my lords, in a time, when, as it seems to me, persons and names are nothing&#x2014;principles and measures every thing&#x2014;[cheers]. This is the view which I take; and if it shall be the lot of the government now in power to contribute to the great objects which combine the interests of all classes in the country, although I shall have no share in it, I shall not grudge them all the credit, gratitude, honour, and applause, which their services will justly call forth.<lb/>
I have, I fear, said too much of myself; and I will with your lordships' permission, revert to the more immediate subject of discussion. I own, I regret, that my noble friend, the Secretary of State, feels it inconsistent with what he considers to be his duty, to produce the papers which are now called for, although in justice to him I must add, that his reasons for not doing so are cogent, and perfectly satisfactory. I feel too much the paramount importance of the peace of Eastern Europe to throw the slightest obstacle in the way of pending negotiations, or to take a single step which might tend to impede the great object which we have all in view. I shall for one be satisfied, provided that object be obtained. I will not now enter into the grounds of justice or policy which led to the Treaty of London. With much of the reasoning of my noble friend who brought forward the motion I am disposed to agree, although
<col>282</col>
upon some points I may think he has pushed his arguments too far. And this I will, however, at once say, that there were grounds of real justice and true policy in the construction of that Treaty, which rendered our interference either as principals or interceders in the affairs of Turkey and Greece necessary. I say that no man who looked to the state of Europe at the date of the protocol of St. Petersburgh, could avoid feeling that the time for this interference had arisen. I know it was felt most strongly, even two or three years ago. It was felt by those who had looked into all the circumstances, that the dreadful war which had for years been raging between Turkey and Greece had disgraced, endangered, and injured the interests of all the countries of Europe. Unless, therefore, some interference took place, to abate the causes which led to this disorganization, or to remove the results that were springing out of them, there was felt to be a certain degree of risk, that we should soon see strife and confusion spread throughout Europe. This I am prepared to maintain; and I think that none of those who are adverse to the protocol of Petersburgh will dispute it. At least I should be astonished if they were to do so, I am ready to admit, that the mode of interference in the Treaty of July is different from that laid down in the protocol. But, had nothing occurred in the interim to occasion that variation? Had no communication been made to the Porte, calling upon her speedily to settle those differences, by which England, as well as the other powers of Europe, were exposed to so much inconvenience and injury&#x2014;the destruction of our shipping, the loss of property almost to an indefinite amount, the horrible cruelties and barbarous massacres of the crews of our ships, too disgusting and dreadful to be described? If we could not redress those injuries by amicable remonstrances, we had a right to attempt it by resorting to force. These, my lords, are facts of common notoriety; they are known to the whole world, and on them I am prepared to maintain the justice and necessity of the measures which have been adopted. I have no doubt of shewing satisfactorily, that no principle of the law of nations repudiated the course which has been pursued. The evils pressed upon us with force, and no men possessing in the least degree the foresight of statesmen, could keep out of view the more
<image src="S2V0018P0I0149"/>
<col>283</col>
serious consequences that would have followed. On these grounds, when the question shall be brought regularly before us, I shall be prepared to maintain the justice and propriety of our conduct, upon every recognized principle of the law of nations, and on all the grounds of policy which are acted upon by civilized states. I care not when the discussion comes on&#x2014;whether it be now or on a future day; but I hope and believe, come when it may, that the justice, reason, and policy of our conduct can be fully maintained; and if the issue can be accomplished, so that these hostilities shall subside in peace, the government which shall achieve that result will receive and deserve the unqualified thanks and approbation of their country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00216"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> said, that after the explanation which had been given by the noble Secretary of State, he did not rise for the purpose of entering upon the question to which the motion immediately referred. Although, on the one hand, he could not undertake to recommend to ministers the adoption of the noble earl's motion, on the other hand, he could not sit in his place, and hear it said, by any authority in that House, that the measures of the government with which he had been connected&#x2014;he meant at the time when the protocol was signed by the noble duke now his majesty's prime minister&#x2014;were to be looked upon in the same point of view, as regarded the law of nations, as the treaty of July 1827. He would not follow the noble mover in the discussion of the policy of the measures of the protocol, and of the treaty. Nothing, he was sure, could be more repugnant to itself, than that the noble earl should set out by telling their lordships that the production of the papers was indispensable to the discussion of these measures, and that he should afterwards launch out into an ample examination of the propriety of those measures, which he had before said could not be properly discussed in the absence of information. He would, however, trouble
<col>284</col>
their lordships with a few words on the subject of the protocol and of the treaty but he would previously beg leave to say that so anxious, so teasing, so, vexatious a curiosity did he feel to know the purport of the instructions given to the admirals, that that curiosity could only be repressed by the consideration which he had mentioned. He could not imagine what was the tenor of instructions, which ordered them to prevent collision, but yet to commit no acts of hostility. He wished his noble friend could tell their lordships how three admirals, besides the commanders of God knew how many frigates, could sail into the Bay of Navarino and keep clear of hostilities. Indeed, in the last debate in that House, it was avowed that the treaty necessarily and unavoidably led to hostilities&#x2014;and yet those who made this avowal were parties to the instructions to prevent collision, but to avoid hostilities&#x0021; He was an Englishman, an old Englishman, he had English habits and English feelings; and he had no hesitation in saying, that if a Turkish or a French fleet came close alongside an English fleet in one of our own ports, as the English, French, and Russian, fleets did in the bay of Navarino, and if the commander of the English fleet did not fight them because they came there, he would deserve to be employed no longer. The law of England said, that if one man held his fist in the face of another, even though he did not strike him, it was an assault: so might the advance of the combined fleets be considered an assault upon the Turks. With respect to the protocol, it would be found, when examined, a measure consistent with the law of nations, and following up the practice pursued by this government in the instance of the South American colonies, which some noble lords thought had not been interfered with soon enough, while others, were of opinion that they had been interfered with too soon. He was prepared to show, that this government interfered in behalf of the South American colonies at the express moment, and not a moment sooner than by the law of nations it was allowable. When the protocol was examined, it would be found to proceed on precisely the same system. It made a tender of our good offices towards an accommodation; and if they were not accepted, then we were to wait until the law of nations should enable us to do something more. When the question should come on regularly for
<image src="S2V0018P0I0150"/>
<col>285</col>
discussion, he should be prepared to show, that the treaty was indefensible in every principle, as regarded the law of nations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00217"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> said, he did not rise to discuss the principles of the protocol, or of the treaty of July. The time would come when it would be open to their lordships to discuss the policy of those measures fully, and it would be his duty to meet that discussion. It was his firm intention to carry into full and ample execution, according to its spirit, and letter, the treaty to which his majesty was a party. It was his duty to carry that treaty into effect with good faith; and it did not become him to cast any imputation upon it, in the way of comparison with the original measure&#x2014;the protocol of St. Petersburgh. It was true that the protocol did not carry with it the measures of execution which were attached to the treaty; but it should be recollected, that such measures were under consideration at the time of the protocol, and that they must at some future time be taken into consideration. Although those measures of execution were not the same as were attached to the treaty&#x2014;although they were not coercive&#x2014;they were yet such as were calculated to induce the Porte to accept of the proffered mediation. It was not his intention to go into a minute discussion on this subject at the present moment. He would assure the noble mover, that it was his decided intention to carry that treaty into effect, in its spirit as well as in its letter. But he could not help dissenting from a great portion of the speech of the noble lord. He did not admit that it was the right of one country to interfere with the internal regulation of another in all cases. No doubt the political position of countries, in some instances, might justify such interference; but such was not the general rule. Non-interference was the rule: interference the exception. That was the only true and safe policy. He did not mean to say that the interference in the present case was not necessary. He himself had been the means of negotiating the act of interference; but that was an exception to the conduct of this country when her interference had been solicited on the occasion of insurrections in other nations. So far he stated in corroboration of what had been said by his noble friend (lord Dudley) on the subject of the motion. With regard to the instructions, there was no doubt that they were intended
<col>286</col>
to be drawn up, and were in fact drawn up by the ministers of the united courts residing in London. They were not the instructions of this government alone: they proceeded from the three governments, and were the result of various diplomatic conferences between the ministers of those powers. Besides, it should be recollected, that they referred to a transaction which was not yet concluded, and, if the British government alone had issued them, it would be the duty of its ministers to entreat their lordships not to ask for those instructions, until the transactions should be in such a state that their production could not be attended with mischievous consequences. Having before stated the intention of government to carry into execution the treaty of July, it was not without surprise that he had heard the noble lord opposite ask his noble friend near him what guarantee he had for the execution of that convention? From the moment that he had received from his majesty the commission to form a new administration&#x2014;a commission which he had executed to the best of his ability&#x2014;from that moment he felt it to be his duty to parry strictly into effect the provisions of the treaty. In all his communications with his noble friend, and with those gentlemen who had done him the honour to unite with him in carrying on his majesty's government, he had distinctly stated that such was his firm intention. The noble lord talked of guarantee? Did the noble lord suppose that those gentlemen who had done him the honour to connect themselves with him in his majesty's service, knowing as they did the opinions which he entertained and the principles which he professed&#x2014;did the noble lord imagine, that they would come to him and require a guarantee for the due practical applications of those principles, before they would concur with him in carrying on the measures of government? Or was it to be believed, on the other hand, that, entertaining those opinions, he would abandon them for the purpose&#x2014;the corrupt purpose (for such it would be)&#x2014;of procuring the support and services of those gentlemen in consideration of that sacrifice? Is it to be supposed (continued the noble duke) that the right hon. gentleman to whom I understand the noble earl to allude, could have used the expressions ascribed to him at the Liverpool election? If my right hon. friend had entered into any such corrupt bargain as he was repre-

<col>287</col>
sented to describe, he would have tarnished his own fame, as much as I should have disgraced mine. It is much more probable&#x2014;though I have not thought it worth my while to ask for any explanation on the subject&#x2014;that my right hon. friend stated, not that he had concluded any wholesale bargain with me, but that the men of whom the government is now composed are in themselves a guarantee to the public, that their measures will be such as will be conducive to his majesty's honour and interests, and to the happiness of the people. That is what the right hon. gentleman said, if I am not mistaken; and not that I had given him any guarantee for the principles of the government. No guarantee was required, and none was given on my part. But I beg to know, supposing any guarantee had been given to any one gentleman who acceded to the government, what has been done towards others in the same situation? Was there no other man whom it was necessary to satisfy in the government but the right hon. gentleman? Every member of an existing government has a right to state his views of the duties of that government, to have his objections satisfied, to state his opinions upon every subject proposed for the consideration of government, and to have those opinions decided upon. How, then, does the matter stand? Surely, I could not have withheld explanations from some, and given guarantees to others. I appeal to my noble friend near me, whether every member of the present government cannot state his opinions as fairly and as freely now as under any preceding administration. It is conducted on the same principles as the cabinet of which I was a member for eight years, under lord Liverpool, and in which all measures were fairly considered by all the members of it. I was an assenting party to the greater part of the measures of that government, and therefore I hold myself responsible for them equally with the other members of that government. My opinions are perfectly well known. I have departed from none of them; nor has my right hon. friend, I believe, departed from any of his.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00218"><member>The Marquis of Clanricarde</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;My lords, it is with great diffidence that I intrude upon the time and attention of this House; but, notwithstanding what has fallen from the noble earl on the cross-bench upon the subject of explanations, I cannot refrain from seeking to obtain a
<col>288</col>
more detailed explanation from the noble Secretary of State opposite, of the motives which induced him to act in concert with noble lords to whom, in the last session of parliament, he appeared to be directly opposed.<lb/>
It is needless for me to recall to your lordships' recollection the occurrences of that session, or to recapitulate in detail, the grounds upon which I conclude that the coalition which has taken place could not, by possibility, have been entered into under ordinary circumstances. Surely, private feelings, and respect for the memory of an individual, to whom my noble friend was long personally, as well as latterly, politically attached, would have prevented it; and I am bound to believe that a strong sense of public duty alone can have induced my noble friend to unite himself with the noble lords on the opposite side of the House.<lb/>
I hope I shall meet with the indulgence of the House, if, in seeking these explanations of my noble friend, I am led, almost unavoidably, to refer to the statements and explanations lately entered into by a right hon. gentleman, and which have been already alluded to in the course of this debate. I am anxious to learn whether my noble friend concurs in what has been stated by the right hon. gentleman, upon whose speech I wish to make some remarks. My right hon. friend is explicit and satisfactory, as far as he goes, in his account of the reconstruction of the government in the last autumn, consequent upon an event, for which I will not intrude the expression of any private feelings, but which, I must be allowed to say, I consider to have been a great national calamity: but he has omitted to take to himself the credit, which I think he deserves, for having at that time made a declaration (in which I understood that the noble earl had joined, he will set me right if I am misinformed) that nothing should induce him to take a part in an administration with those who had been so personally hostile to his late lamented friend.<lb/>
I see no reason why a declaration, which, in my humble opinion, does honour to the feelings of those who made it, should be withheld from the public. It seems we are to consider no explanation as to political motives necessary; for we are told, that no differences of opinion existed between any members of the present government and my late lamented relative,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0152"/>
<col>289</col>
Upon that I can only say, that if it be true, I am free to confess, that I have, for a long time, laboured under a great mistake&#x2014;a mistake which I consider to be the more extraordinary, seeing that I know many persons, better able to form a correct judgment upon this subject than I am, to have shared it with me: I shall be glad to hear any proofs which the noble earl can adduce to settle my doubts on this head; for I own that my right hon. friend's assertion, that such impressions are without foundation has not quite convinced me of their fallacy.<lb/>
But my right hon. friend, not content with stating his conviction, that there existed no difference of opinion between my lamented relative and the noble duke at the head of the present administration, has insinuated, that the present arrangement would have received the approbation of the distinguished individual who is now no more. I do not hesitate to assert, that the government, as at present constituted, would never have received his sanction; and in support of that opinion I will, with your lordships' permission, read an extract of a letter addressed by him to the noble duke, on the 5th of May, 1827. It was in consequence of, indeed in answer to, a speech delivered in this House by the noble duke a few days before its date; and I hope I shall be guilty of no impropriety in now quoting from it the sentiments of the writer on the point in question:
<quote>"There is but one other point in your grace's speech which appears to call for any observation from me. Your grace emphatically says, that <i>your</i> being at the head of the government was <i>wholly</i> out of the question. I learned this opinion of your grace with sincere pleasure. The union of the whole power, civil and military, in the same hands (for your grace as prime minister could never have effectually divested yourself of your influence over the army) would certainly, in my opinion, have constituted a station too great for <i>any subject,</i> and one incompatible with the practice of a free constitution. Nothing would have induced me to serve under such a form of government, and I was rejoiced to find that your grace's opinion was always against such an arrangement."</quote>
Upon this subject I need say no more. I cannot impart any additional weight to such ample and unanswerable testimony of my lamented relative's opinion upon it. I must say, that I think my right hon. friend
<col>290</col>
has fallen into a great error, if he supposed that he was supporting the principles of his lamented friend, by joining the present administration; and I hope the noble earl will give to the House a more explicit detail of the motives which guided him. The noble duke's speech has made my noble friend's conduct appear to me even more inexplicable than it did before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00219"><member>Earl Dudley</member><membercontribution> said, that in answer to the observations of the noble marquis, he rose to state the two reasons which had formed the grounds of his recent conduct. And first he would allude to those peculiar and personal circumstances which, it was said, ought to have influenced his conduct as an individual; and then to those public and political principles which ought to have influenced his conduct as a minister. On both these heads he should offer a few words. And, first, as to the peculiar grounds arising out of personal attachment, which ought, in the judgment of that noble marquis, to have prevented him from taking office under the present administration. It was stated, that there were certain persons in the present government, who, soon after the formation of the late cabinet, had used angry expressions towards some of the members of that cabinet, and particularly towards its illustrious head; and it was therefore said, that as he had been a member of that cabinet, and had acted under its leader, he ought to have declined taking a situation in the present administration. Now, he would ask their lordships, whether they would sanction the doctrine, that the use of such expressions ought never to be forgotten,&#x2014;whether they would admit such a plea as the sacred duty of immortalizing hatred, and of sacrificing public grounds of action to the claims of private friendship,&#x2014;whether, looking back at the history of the country, and of the most distinguished characters who had conducted its councils, they would tell the world that, in point of prudence, of duty, and of private feeling, public men were bound to cherish for ever the sentiments of political opposition which they had once had the misfortune to entertain against, each other? He would remind their lordships, that the life of his lamented friend afforded a strong proof in illustration of his opinion upon this particular point. Were there ever feelings of greater bitterness;&#x2014;feelings which displayed themselves not merely in the shape of personal ill will, but of direct quarrel
<image src="S2V0018P0I0153"/>
<col>291</col>
and conflict&#x2014;than those which once existed between his right hon. friend and the noble marquis, the minister for Foreign Affairs to whom he succeeded? They, however, were reconciled to each other, and consented to sit and to act together in the same cabinet; and yet, with that circumstance notorious to all the world, what was the lesson which the noble marquis opposite now wished to teach the House? For his own part, he was of opinion that it was a matter of high praise to both the illustrious individuals to whom he had alluded, that they had had the manliness both to forget and to forgive. He had repeatedly had the happiness of seeing them, after their personal conflict, acting together not merely with all the sincerity which the public situations which they respectively held demanded of them, but he believed in his conscience with all the kindness and frankness of private cordiality. Was it, then, he would ask, from the example of his illustrious and lamented friend, that he was to learn the lesson of uncompromising and unrelenting political hostility. To that great and distinguished man he was bound by the ties of early and long-continued friendship: he might even say by the ties of gratitude; for if the situation which he had then the honour to hold was an object of ambition and gratification, he had obtained it entirely by the kindness and partiality of his deceased friend. For him, therefore, to cast any imputation on the conduct of the late premier&#x2014;for him to do any thing, in acceding to the present government, which was either unkind or disrespectful to his departed friend's memory, was, if he knew aught of his own heart, a matter quite impossible. He had asked himself the question, whether there was any private or personal consideration which ought to prevent him from acting in concert with the members of the present administration, seeing that his own political opinions generally coincided with theirs; and the answer which his conscience dictated to that question was, that no such consideration did exist. He sincerely believed that there was no difference of opinion, which the efflux of time would not have dissipated; in point of fact, the differences which existed between his right hon. friend and the gentlemen now in office were not of a personal nature. And that they were so regarded by Mr. Canning himself his conduct towards those noble lords and gentlemen sufficiently proved.
<col>292</col>
Notwithstanding any angry discussions which might have been going on in this or in the other House, habits of personal intercourse were cultivated by him with his opponents. Having said thus much in explanation of his own conduct as regarded his right hon. friend, he would now offer a word as to the terms upon which he had become a member of the present administration. A good deal had been said about stipulation. If by stipulation was meant that sort of agreement by which one man consented to forego something which he ought to have maintained, in order to keep in with any set of men&#x2014;in that sense there certainly was no stipulation. But if by stipulation was meant any communication or preliminary understanding, with respect to some points of great political importance&#x2014;that was, whether certain impressions were not made upon the minds of the surviving members of the late cabinet, by conferences with the noble duke at the head of the government&#x2014;such an understanding did exist. We did not stipulate that the government should incline in favour of what was generally called Catholic emancipation. We only understood that a strict neutrality should be observed upon it by the government, as was the case with the two cabinets which preceded it. We did not stipulate that the noble duke should not abandon the treaties into which the late government had entered with foreign powers. We heard from the noble duke the footing upon which he wished the government to stand. We understood from him, that he was inclined to observe the same fair and complete neutrality, with respect to the Catholic question, which had been observed under the two former governments. With regard to another point; namely, the foreign policy of the country, the noble duke had also declared, that having found, by the minutes of council of his predecessors, that his majesty was bound by treaty to perform certain agreements entered into with other powers, he spontaneously, and as part of his duty, would maintain and perform those agreements, from a proper regard for the honour of his master and the interests of the country. Stipulations, he repeated, they made none; but their understanding and agreement were, upon all subjects, complete; and under such circumstances, he said, once and for all, that he was not ashamed of retaining the situation in his majesty's present adminis-

tration, which it was his fortune to have held under the administration which immediately preceded it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00220"><member>The Marquis of Lansdowne</member><membercontribution> said, that although he had sufficient motives in what had already passed that evening before their lordships to determine him upon undergoing the painful task of asking their lordships' attention to circumstances purely personal to himself, still he deemed it most respectful to the House, to the importance of the question which had been moved by his noble friend, and to the great political considerations with which that question was connected, to ask the attention of their lordships on that evening to a short detail of facts, which it would have been his bounden duty, at some time or other, to submit to their lordships. He should do this the more willingly, because, though he was under the necessity of adverting to several considerations personal to himself, he should certainly take no part in those views of a personal nature, which had been lately brought forward by the noble earl at the head of the foreign department, and by the noble marquis who preceded him, respecting the circumstances which had led the noble earl to leave that government of which he and the noble earl formed a part, and to join that of which the noble earl now was a constituent member.<lb/>
With respect to the motion which is at present before your lordships (continued the noble marquis), I must frankly confess to my noble friend and to your lordships, that anxious, most anxious as I feel, not only that the papers for which my noble friend has moved, but also that other papers connected with them, going much further back into the transactions, and most necessary to their full and perfect elucidation, should be produced, still, after the solemn asseveration of my noble friend at the head of the foreign department, that he is engaged in negotiation respecting them at this very moment, I, notwithstanding my private impression, that all the papers may be safely produced, must acquiesce in the objection which my noble friend at the head of the foreign department has made to their production at this time, and must express my hope, that my noble friend who originated this debate will not press his motion to a division. I am the more ready to acquiesce in the objection taken by my noble friend, and to believe in the motives which he has stated for declining
<col>294</col>
to assent to this motion, because I know of no person who is more interested than he is in the production of the whole of these papers. No person, I say, is more interested than my noble friend is, as well on account of the light which they will throw upon the correspondence which he has himself conducted on this subject, as on account of the honour which they are certain to reflect upon those who preceded him in his own immediate office, upon the policy and talents of his late right hon. friend, to whom such frequent allusion has been made this night, whose services were unhappily lost to his country in the course of last year, at a time when they were most likely to be beneficial, and whose magnificent endowments shone with the brightest blaze, at the very moment when they were about to be extinguished forever. Yes, my lords, great and resplendent as the fame of that right hon. gentleman already is, when these papers shall be produced, it will derive additional lustre. I am the more confident of the effect which they must hereafter produce upon the minds of your lordships and of the public, in guiding the judgment, which the noble earl tells you, and tells you justly you ought not to form, until after you have seen them; I am the more confident, I say, of the effect which they must produce, from observing the effect which they have already produced on a noble lord opposite, who from his situation has been enabled to inspect them. If the noble lord who now holds the privy seal (lord Ellenborough), and from whom I heard the last general Condemnation which was passed in this House upon the foreign policy of Mr. Canning's administration&#x2014;if that noble lord on perusing these papers, has not only been able to bring himself to join in an unanimous vote of this House in approbation of the expedition which Mr. Canning sent to Portugal&#x2014;an expedition which I heard him, last year, in this very House, most loudly Condemn&#x2014;if he has convinced himself of the justice and expediency of the principles which actuated Mr. Canning's foreign policy, out of which, I call upon the noble earl at the head of the foreign department to confirm me, when I say that every act of the government emanated for the last six months&#x2014;if he has honestly and conscientiously&#x2014;and I do not doubt that he has honestly and conscientiously&#x2014;brought himself to form part of a government, the head of which
<image src="S2V0018P0I0155"/>
<col>295</col>
has this evening promulgated in a manner that can admit of no doubt, that there is to be no change in the foreign policy which Mr. Canning adopted&#x2014;I can have no doubt that those who approach these papers without that natural bias, which the expression of past opinion may naturally be supposed to create, will rise from the perusal of them with the warmest admiration of the genius and ability which shines forth in every line of them.<lb/>
Although I perfectly agree with the noble earl opposite, that it would be most unwise and impolitic to consider what are the real merits of this question without first seeing all the documents connected with it, and not merely those for which my noble friend has moved, I cannot help observing, that in the meanwhile your lordships and the public cannot more usefully employ your attention than in considering the grounds on which your judgment ought to be formed when those papers are produced; and in the few words which I shall say upon that subject, I think the noble and learned lord on the cross bench will not accuse me of anticipating the conclusion to which the House may come, or of forming deductions without knowing the premises from which I draw them. The noble and learned lord, however, must give me leave to say, that at the very time when he was accusing my noble friend near me of anticipating conclusions without examining premises, he was pronouncing a most decided judgment upon the conduct of sir Edward Codrington in entering the bay of Navarino&#x2014;a judgment which, I solemnly declare, it is my opinion that no man either can or ought to form, without seeing the papers on which that movement was made, and which, when produced, I also solemnly declare will, in my opinion, justify the conduct of that gallant officer to the conviction of all mankind, and will satisfactorily explain all the circumstances under which he ordered the British fleet to sail to the position of the Turkish squadron. And here, as the noble and learned lord has spoken out so plainly, I will allude, not to matters which are contained in any of the papers which my noble friend at the head of the Foreign Department thinks it inconvenient to the public service to produce at present, but to matters which are of general geographical notoriety, and which, by some accident, have hitherto escaped, the attention of all those who
<col>296</col>
have either written or spoken on the subject. I mean, that the island near which this battle was fought is part and parcel of the British dominions. The island of Sphacteria, which lies in the bay of Navarino, and off which the action with the Turkish squadron took place, is part of the Ionian Islands, and therefore a British fleet had a right to anchor off it, in any manner and at any time it pleased. I believe that there is no lawyer who, if he were retained in behalf of admiral Codrington, would not, with the help of a map of the territory of the Ionian Islands, make out a good case for him upon this very ground. I believe that a very inferior lawyer to the noble and learned lord would find no difficulty in getting up a case on it, which no argument or ingenuity could possibly overthrow. I repeat, that I am not going to allude to any particular circumstances contained in the documents which it is now thought prudent not to produce; but I would ask of your lordships, while those documents are withheld from you, to make up your minds as to the grounds on which you will judge of that event which has been termed unfortunate, and which really was unfortunate, seeing that blood was shed in it, but which was beyond all dispute a most brilliant and successful naval operation. We all know&#x2014;and I agree with the noble duke who made the observation&#x2014;that any interference in the affairs of foreign states is an exception to the general rule of policy, which ought to guide the conduct of this country. It is quite clear, however, that occasions must sometimes arise, in which mediations, and armed mediations too, are necessary to secure the peace and repose of the world; and when the question of our interference in the present instance shall come to be argued, I will not desire to argue it on any other ground than that on which the noble and learned lord has this night placed it; namely, its tendency to secure the ultimate peace and tranquillity of Europe. I know, my lords, and your lordships know too, that it is not by pusillanimously avoiding to engage in those transactions in which other European powers are involved, that peace is most likely to be ultimately assured; and I hope that your lordships will take every pains to ascertain, not merely whether our mediation was made in the best manner in which it could be made, but also whether it was not one of those mediations
<image src="S2V0018P0I0156"/>
<col>297</col>
which the different powers were compelled to make, not for the benefit of any two of them, but for the security of Europe at large, in order to prevent the establishment of a system which would disturb the balance of power, and consequently injure the peace of nations. If there did exist any legitimate cause for our commencing an armed mediation, then, I say, we were bound to pursue, even by arms, an interference that was intended for a beneficial purpose. I then ask your lordships to consider, whether it was most beneficial to this country, and most likely to contribute to the peace of Europe, to leave that interference in the hands of a power which might carry it further than we either recommended or approved, and which might extend it beyond that limit within which we might think it desirable to confine it for the benefit of ourselves and of others; to leave one colossus to act in the solitude of its power, unchecked by any obligation, and uncontrolled by that community of principle, which must always exist among confederated nations;&#x2014;or, seeing that an act was to be done&#x2014;that a danger was to be avoided, that a system was going on of which the tendency was to impair the commerce of the Mediterranean, and that a new power was erecting itself there to the general danger and inconvenience of all Europe&#x2014;to join with others, taking such steps as were certain to avert from us the danger we anticipated? I say, therefore, that the peace of the world is the standard by which all these operations ought to be measured. When the documents, of which I have been speaking, are before you, it will be for your lordships to judge whether the law of nations has been complied with&#x2014;whether the case in question has not been taken out of the ordinary laws, and does not involve other considerations&#x2014;and whether the government did not exercise a sound policy and discretion, in applying to them a principle which, though it controls them, controls them no further than is consistent with the general repose and tranquillity of Europe.<lb/>
My lords, the discussion of this night has given rise, and not unnaturally, to statements which embrace other topics than the affairs of Greece, and which enter upon all the prospects and policy of the government of this country. To those statements which have been published by all parties, more or less, I will now venture
<col>298</col>
to call your attention.&#x2014;The noble marquis then entered into a detail of facts, which, from the manner in which he occasionally lowered his voice, was not distinctly audible below the bar. He commenced it by an account of the difference which subsisted during the time of the late administration between Mr. Huskisson and Mr. Herries. The difference was a striking and important difference, but not, as it would appear, an irreconcileable difference, for they were now sitting together in the same cabinet. The noble marquis praised the frankness with which lord Goderich had spoken with respect to that difference, and, indeed, with respect to all the circumstances which had terminated in the dissolution of the ministry of which he was the head. He agreed with the noble lord in saying, that he never looked upon the formation of that ministry as a mere temporary arrangement of the government. Had he ever believed it to be an arrangement of that kind, no inducement would have led him to retain for an hour the situation which he had had the honour to fill in it. There was another point, on which he felt himself as much bound as his noble friend to set himself right with the country. He had seen a speech of a right hon. gentleman&#x2014;which he believed to be in substance correct, as it appeared to be very accurately reported, and as all the reports agreed in the leading points of it&#x2014;on which it was incumbent upon him to make a few observations, as his right hon. friend appeared to have unintentionally fallen into some error. My right hon. friend, Mr. Huskisson (continued the noble marquis), has stated to his constituents at Liverpool, the substance of a conversation which took place between me and him, on the 11th of January last, as connected with the dissolution of the cabinet over which lord Goderich presided. In meeting my right I hon. friend on the day on which I had the conversation with him, a part of which he has stated, I met him on a footing of the most perfect confidence; having in the last confidential communication I had with him received from him a full statement of the particulars of the difference which had arisen between him and the chancellor of the Exchequer, and of the necessity in which he might, in consequence, feel himself of resigning. I stated my concurrence in the course which my right hon. friend was taking, upon the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0157"/>
<col>299</col>
facts of which I was then, for the first: time, informed, and I repeated the assurance of that concurrence in a letter on the following morning. I therefore met my right hon. friend on the 11th of January, after the result had proved the breaking up of the government, prepared both to expect from him, and to return, the most entire confidence. Nothing but what was correct has been stated by my right hon. friend as having passed in that conversation; but, as I trust that no person can be less suspected than myself of ostentatiously rejecting a proposition perhaps never intended to be made, I am desirous of stating, that it was not until after my right hon. friend had stated to me, upon very high authority, circumstances that induced me to think it probable that a proposal might immediately be made to me, and that I myself having seen Mr. Peel, had stated to that gentleman the impossibility, after what had passed last year relating to the Catholic question, of my serving under him, that I thought myself bound in frankness to state, that though I neither considered myself as receiving or as making any formal communication, I could not conceal that in an administration formed under auspices apparently so unfavourable to the settlement of those great questions in Ireland, from an ultimate decision on which I was convinced neither the parliament nor the country could long escape, I could hardly be induced to take a part without such an explanation on these subjects as I could not expect at present to be made; that I felt no objection, but on the contrary respect, for the individuals named as about to form the administration, nor any inclination to withhold assistance that might be useful; but I could not look to any such arrangement with confidence, as respecting the most important question in which the domestic interests of the empire were involved. Both when I had joined Mr. Canning, and when I had obeyed my sovereign's commands in retaining office, in September, under circumstances that might have justified me in quitting it, it had been in great measure with a view to the advantage to be derived to Ireland from the person at the head of the government being favourably disposed to the settlement of Ireland&#x2014;a view in which I was confirmed by finding it had been taken by Mr. Peel, and had induced that gentleman, on the same ground, to
<col>300</col>
take an opposite course. I state most distinctly, that political and not personal objections formed the ground of my refusing to join the present administration; for nothing would hurt me more than to have it supposed that I ostentatiously put forward personal objections to the members of a government. I do not complain of the statement which the right hon. gentleman has made. There was nothing unfair or uncandid in it: but I regret, that in his anxiety to set himself right with his constituents, he did, in conveying to them some notion of the causes of the dissolution of the government, think himself bound to withhold that which both the noble earl and myself had stated to be the principal cause of it. One thing, however, I must confess, pleased me. His statement went the full length of saying, that the whole foreign and commercial policy of this country was guaranteed to be the same as that of the administration of Mr. Canning [hear]. This was a plain, distinct, and, up to this moment, uncontradicted statement; and it is a testimony of the strongest kind, that the present members of the administration are convinced of the wisdom of that policy. I am glad that the noble lord opposite is now relieved from the charge of having indulged in personal animosity against Mr. Canning, and that his strong expressions are declared to have been against the policy of that right hon. gentleman, and not to have originated in personal dislike. That disapprobation of Mr. Canning's measures has now vanished; and I am warranted in believing, that the same change of opinion would have taken place in the noble lord if, when out of office, he had possessed the same means of judging that he now does. If, therefore, after due deliberation, he has satisfied himself that, on all points, he can act with the present government, which stands pledged to support Mr. Canning's policy, I congratulate them on having obtained so useful an ally, and I hail his appearance as a friend to that cause.&#x2014;For myself, I am little disposed to enter into any cause of opposition to the present government, as I am so positively assured that they will pursue measures which, I am certain, have for their end, the good of the country. I have no motives for going into such opposition. When I resigned the seals of office in the employment of the discharge of which I was honoured with the approbation of his majesty, I did not feel any

thing like an intention to enter on a course of opposition to the government; and still less do I feel it now, when I find that it is to be conducted on principles which I approve of, and which, if strictly pursued, will, I am sure, deserve and obtain the confidence of the people.&#x2014;With respect to that which is called the Catholic question, I certainly know that I do not entertain the same sentiments as the noble duke; but at the same time, I trust that it will not, on this account, be allowed to retrograde. I am told that it will be treated as a neutral question; but I nevertheless wait with peculiar anxiety for the result, as I know too much of political affairs not to be aware, that in the country to which this question so mainly attaches, the principal garrison may be said to be in the hands of the enemy; but though we are thus placed under the guns of the fort, I trust that the principle of the question will continue as sound as heretofore. The noble duke has pledged himself, that nothing of hostility shall be evinced on the part of the government; but he must excuse me if I say, that I must look at the actions of the cabinet, before I can feel satisfied that Ireland may hope for release; but I am quite sure, that the noble duke would not have quitted the situation in which the whole nation wished to see him, and which, of all men, he is most fitted to fill, without the conviction, that by so doing, it would be in his power to render the commercial and financial departments of the state greater services, than if he had remained in it. The eyes of his country and of Europe are upon all his actions, and I trust that the brilliancy of these actions, of which the country is now enjoying the advantages will be eclipsed by others still more splendid&#x2014;by others as splendid as the noble duke himself can possibly wish them to be. But I must confess that I should see that appointment with greater satisfaction, if I could bring myself to believe that the interests of the army would be distinctly separate from the present office of the noble duke. I am glad, however, for the safe of the constitution, that that pledge has been given; and I hope that it will be strictly adhered to; for I think the noble duke acted wisely and constitutionally, when he intimated, on the first day of the session, that a separation of office was to take place, I shall watch every thing that takes place, as a member of the legislature; and I can assure
<col>302</col>
the noble duke, that I wish him success in his administration; but before I sit down, I beg leave to assure him, that whatever he may be able to achieve, there is one thing which he never can achieve, and against which I warn him&#x2014;let him steadfastly remember, that he may conciliate, but that he can never reconquer Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00221"><member>Lord Ellenborough</member><membercontribution> said, that whenever his majesty's ministers feel themselves at liberty to lay upon the table of the House all the papers, from which alone a full knowledge of all the circumstances which had taken place could be derived, he should be as ready as the noble marquis himself to express his opinion upon them to the House. He would assure him, that whatever his opinion might have been, previous to his joining the present administration, on the subject alluded to, it had remained unaltered, and no man had presumed to question him on the subject. The noble marquis had considered it as a proof of inconsistency on his part, that he (lord E.) who had disapproved of the expedition to Portugal should have now approved of the expressions made use of in his majesty's Speech. That expedition was sent out to Portugal in fulfilment of our treaty, and its object was to preserve the peace of Portugal; but, admitting that he had disapproved of that expedition, surely there was no reason why he should be dissatisfied with the announcement in his majesty's Speech of the probability of the troops being soon withdrawn. The noble marquis, however, was wrong both in his facts and his reasonings. He had never disapproved of the expedition to Portugal. How could he disapprove of the honourable performance of a treaty? But he did disapprove of calling that expedition "a master stroke of policy," because that could not have been a master stroke of policy, in which there was no choice left, and which executed only the conditions of a treaty. If, however, he had disapproved of the expedition, how much more warmly must he approve of that part of his majesty's Speech in which it was announced that that expedition was at an end? Then as to the foreign policy of Mr. Canning; he had been asked, how he would act on that policy with his present colleagues? But the fact was, that he had never heard any man attempt to, explain what the principles of Mr. Canning's foreign policy were, as contradistinguished from those of his predecessor. He very well remembered that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0159"/>
<col>303</col>
Mr. Canning had said, that he should act unfairly towards that government of which he had recently been a member, if he did not state that he had found those principles already reduced to writing. Yet this was called Mr. Canning's system of foreign policy. The noble marquis had stated, that the recognition of the independence of the South American States was the work of Mr. Canning, that this was also a part of his policy; but this statement was also incorrect, for at the meeting at Aix-la-Chapelle it was very evident that things were then moving towards the recognition of those States, and the question was merely one of time, as to the period at which they ought to be recognized. The merit of this recognition was, therefore, not due to Mr. Canning. With regard to the treaty of the 6th July, he was as ready as any of his noble friends who surrounded him could be, to carry it fairly and fully into effect, but in the spirit of conciliation and peace&#x2014;a spirit which some noble lords did not seem to understand. He perfectly agreed with what had fallen from his noble friend, the foreign secretary. He never was the personal enemy of Mr. Canning. He had only met him once or twice in his life, and what had passed between them was in the ordinary intercourse of civility. He believed that Mr. Canning was a man beloved by all his friends, and that he was endowed with many virtues. He looked upon him as a great public man, but as a dangerous minister; and if he were then present he should not hesitate to oppose him. That feeling he formerly entertained, and he entertained it still: but ought that to prevent him from sitting by the side of his noble friend? The noble marquis had alluded to the commercial policy, and had stated, that that also was Mr. Canning's. But he should recollect, that at the time those measures were brought forward, he (Lord E.) was sitting on the other side of the House, and that he had not opposed them. He approved, generally speaking, of the principles of free trade, and should be desirous of carrying them into effect as widely as possible; but, as some persons formerly argued in favour of the slave trade, by comparing the condition of the slaves of the West Indies with their condition before they left Africa, forgetting the miseries of their intervening state, and thus attempted to justify the traffic&#x2014;so it appeared to him, that some persons now were too prone to look at the attainment
<col>304</col>
of national wealth, without looking at the condition of individual interests, which had grown up under another state of things. The noble marquis could not find fault with him in respect to the Catholic question; as that question remained in the present administration, just as it had been in that of which the noble marquis had formed a part. He had said, last year, and he would repeat it now, that the Catholic question was likely to stand better in a neutral government than in one united in its favour; for he was convinced, that if such a government could be formed, it would produce such a reaction in the public mind, as would throw it back for many years; and, however paradoxical it might appear, he was satisfied that more good could be done for the Catholics by a mixed or neutral government, than by a government formed entirely of individuals in their favour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00222"><member>Lord Wharncliffe</member><membercontribution> said, the noble baron had stated, that he considered Mr. Canning to have been a dangerous minister, but that he would support a government founded upon his principles. Now, must not the noble lord himself be a dangerous minister, if he acted upon such principles? They had been publicly told, that the reason why the friends of Mr. Canning had joined the present government was, that they had received a pledge that the policy of the last government would be followed in every respect. It was not enough to tell the country, that the treaty of the 6th of July was to be carried into execution. He would appeal to the House, whether Mr. Canning was not at the head of a party acting upon more liberal principles than any other; and admiring, as he did, Mr. Canning, he could not believe that the policy of the present administration was, to follow the footsteps of Mr. Canning. They were told that his commercial policy was to be followed; that the corn bill introduced last session was to be reconsidered; but where did the noble Secretary of State look for support for that measure? Did he not see sitting by his side those who defeated that bill? He was convinced that these pledges were not worth a farthing. He should wait to see what the measures of the present government would be before he would give it his support. He hoped that they would be such as he could approve of; but, as to their being conducted upon the principles of Mr. Canning's policy, that was a

<title>CORPORATION AND TEST ACTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00224"><member>Mr. Sheriff Stable</member><membercontribution> presented, at the bar, a Petition from the Corporation of London praying for the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00225"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, that in a very large assembly of the Common Council, the majority of whom were members of the established church, he was happy to say the petition had passed with only two or three dissenting voices.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00226"><member>Mr. Alderman Wood</member><membercontribution> said, the petition had been carried by a very considerable majority in the common council, a body consisting of two hundred and sixty persons, two hundred and forty of whom were annually elected. The petition, therefore, spoke the sentiments of that body, and, through them, of the citizens of London. Nothing could more clearly show the "march of the mind," as it was called, than that, in 1790, a similar measure when put forward in the common council, had scarcely a hand held up in favour of it: on the contrary strong resolutions were passed, thanking those members who had voted against the repeal of those obnoxious acts; but now, after the lapse of thirty-seven years, only three or four hands were held up against the petition. He trusted that the illustrious individual at the head of the ministry, and who had been so long at the head of the army, would take a liberal view of this question. He must be well acquainted with the inconvenience which resulted to officers who were compelled, on their arrival in this country, to take the oaths under these acts; and who, if they did not, were liable to be informed against, by any common informer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00227"><member>Mr. Alderman Thompson</member><membercontribution> hoped, that the prayer of the petition would be complied with. It was a folly to be passing, from year to year, an Indemnity act. The law as it now stood occasioned great inconvenience to members of the established church. The Dissenters could not, from conscientious scruples, fill certain offices. The consequence was, that they must be
<col>306</col>
filled by members of the established church, to the exclusion of extremely competent individuals. Whatever reasons might have existed for these enactments in the time of Charles 2nd, there were none now. The citizens of London suffered considerable inconvenience from them. It often happened, that persons, in every way competent to fill the offices of sheriffs; and magistrates, shielded themselves under the plea of their being Dissenters, from taking upon them these expensive and important duties. As a member of the church of England, he conscientiously believed that these acts might be repealed without the slightest danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00228"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> concurred entirely in the liberal sentiments which had fallen from the hon. member. For himself, he was prepared to say, that no religious creed ought to disable men from filling any situation, military or civil. At the same time, it was right to guard against alarming the prejudices of those who thought that the Dissenters could not be relieved unless the Catholics were relieved also. He had shown by the vote he had given, that he was favourable to granting the claims of the Catholics, but at the same time he was glad to see the two questions separated. He thought that the questions ought to be perfectly distinct. He was himself a Dissenter from the church of England, but only because he professed the established religion of Scotland, the land in which he was born. He thought it a monstrous thing, while there were no tests imposed upon persons of the church of England in Scotland, that he, a Scotchman, should be required to undergo any tests in England. If he had an opportunity, when the question came before the House, he would state his reasons why he did not think this brand of ignominy ought to be continued on him, merely because he happened to be born in a different faith from others.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00229"><member>Mr. John Martin</member><membercontribution> complained, that the Corporation of London, while they thus prayed for relief to a certain portion of their citizens, were themselves guilty of intolerance and oppression. He then alluded to some proceedings towards certain butchers in Whitechapel, who had been refused their freedom, on the authority of a bye-law, because they professed the Jewish religion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00230"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, there certainly did exist such a law. It was an
<image src="S2V0018P0I0161"/>
<col>307</col>
old bye-law, not of the corporation, but of the court of Aldermen. The Corporation had set their faces entirely against it, and begged of the court of Aldermen to repeal it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00231"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, there were two classes of persons in the city of London, the one remarkable for just and liberal conduct, the other for conduct directly the reverse. The gaols bore testimony to the illiberality of courts of Aldermen, who had set on foot prosecutions which government, greatly to its credit, had generally discountenanced. He verily believed, that if the law allowed them to revert to the fire and the faggot, the court of Aldermen would take advantage of it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NAVY ESTIMATES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00233"><member>Sir G. Cockburn,</member><membercontribution> in moving that the House should resolve itself into a Committee of Supply, said that, it was his intention to ask for a vote of seamen for six months, and not for the whole year. He had felt it his duty to take this course, because a Finance Committee was about to be appointed, and because it was the course which had been adopted, under similar circumstances, in 1817.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00234"><member>Mr. Maberly</member><membercontribution> said, that as the course adopted in 1817 had been alluded to, he rose to object to that course being so essentially deviated from in the present instance. He was aware that the right hon. Secretary for the Home Department had given notice of a motion for the appointment of a committee to inquire into the finances of the country, but then, in 1817, no supplies were voted for ten days after the message of the Prince Regent had been sent down to the House. A very different course, however, seemed now about to be adopted. When the House was last year promised, that such a committee should be appointed, every measure of finance was postponed, because the House was convinced that Mr. Canning desired earnestly to have the financial affairs of the country thoroughly investigated. The right hon. Secretary opposite must, however, see that the House could not give that confidence to him, which it had reposed in the right hon. gentleman now no more. That right hon. gentleman had acceded to the wishes of the House; but the right hon. Secretary opposite, who had so long been a member of his majesty's government, had never yet acceded to the importunities which had been urged. Be-
<col>308</col>
fore, therefore, confidence was placed in the right hon. gentleman, he wished to know what he meant to propose; to hear his proposition; and especially to hear the names of the persons whom he intended should form this committee. He was quite sure that the right hon. gentleman would himself see that this was neither an extraordinary nor an unreasonable request. He thought the House ought not to vote any seamen until this explanation had been made. To ask for a vote of seamen for six months was going too far. In all probability they would not get any report from that committee, until late in the session; and if so, the whole affair would pass over till next year, and the public would derive no benefit whatever from the appointment of the committee. They ought, first of all, to have a pledge that what was to be done would be done that year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00235"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he certainly had no right to complain of the observations of the hon. gentleman. The ground he had taken was a perfectly fair parliamentary ground; but he entreated the hon. member to hear him, and he thought he would see that his objections were not so strong as he appeared to think them. The estimate was founded upon the number of men which it was thought necessary to maintain for the service of the country. It was the province of the sovereign to state that number to the House: and the only vote that the House would be called upon to pass would be, for the wages and victuals of these men, not for the whole year, but for six months; in order that, if the committee of finance found it necessary to make any alteration in this part of the expenditure, they might do so the more easily. Now, in this the precedent of 1817 had been their guide. In 1817, the vote had been asked for a few days later than it was now, because, to defer it, would be to inconvenience the public service. As to the precedent of 1817, it had been followed in every respect, with the exception that the names of the persons were not known. The hon. member had stated, that he could not have confidence in him, because he had long been a member of government, and had never brought forward any motion of this kind. This, however, was inaccurate. It so happened, that he was a member of the government in 1817, and that he also was a member of that finance committee; from which it
<image src="S2V0018P0I0162"/>
<col>309</col>
would seem, that he was by no means adverse to such inquiries. But he would tell the hon. member, that the question of appointing a finance committee had been agitated in lord Liverpool's cabinet, and if that nobleman had continued at the head of the government, such a committee would actually have been appointed. As matters now stood, what had been his conduct? Why, the very day he had taken his seat in the House, he had given notice of this motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00236"><member>Sir John Sebright</member><membercontribution> said, that his opposition was, and should be, given to measures, and not to men. If it could be shown to him, that the public service would be impeded by the refusal of the present vote, he would support it; but no such case had yet been made out. He trusted that the government would proceed voluntarily to measures of economy and retrenchment; but if it did not take that course, it would be the duty of the House to enforce it. He repeated that he was not desirous to oppose the present ministry, especially since it contained one right hon. gentleman peculiarly calculated to take an extended view of the national finances; but for twenty years past the public money had been voted away, session after session, with a facility which he must characterize as indecent. For himself, he could see no possible danger to the public service in taking the present vote only for the term of three months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00237"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> wished to know, whether the present ministers, on coming into their places, had found any plans of economy matured by their predecessors? The late Mr. Canning, in giving notice of the finance committee, had stated, that ministers would apply themselves diligently to the reduction of the public expenditure. Under these circumstances, he was desirous of knowing whether any progress had been made towards the reduction of the public burthens by the predecessors of the present ministry? The frequent recurrence of struggles for ascendancy, of defeats, and of changes, tended greatly to weaken the confidence of the country in the government, and distracted the attention of ministers from a business to which their whole attention should be devoted. He was unwilling to obstruct any necessary supply; yet he thought that ministers ought to explain to the House their intentions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00238"><member>Sir G. Cockburn</member><membercontribution> said, that as he was not
<col>310</col>
a member of Mr. Canning's cabinet, he could not undertake to state what were the intentions of that cabinet; but this he would say, that whatever they were, they must change and vary with circumstances. A material change had taken place in our naval stations in the Mediterranean, since a notice of the committee was first given. An augmentation of our fleet had been rendered necessary at various times, during the last ten years of peace. At one time, that augmentation was required in the West Indies, to protect our commerce from piratical depredations; at another, the Burmese war obliged us to turn our attention to the East. Again, an augmentation of our fleet in the Tagus was rendered necessary; and lastly, in the Mediterranean. Thus, from time to time, we had been under the necessity of making unexpected increases, which particular emergencies required. Notwithstanding this exertion, the government now asked only for a vote of thirty thousand men; a number which could hardly by possibility be reduced. It was true that the amount was not considerably less than heretofore; but, with the same means, a great deal more was to be effected. To take the vote for three months would be a deception upon the House; because, if the finance committee should object to the employment of thirty thousand men, it would not be possible, within the term of three months, to reduce them. It was right to add, that the estimates had of late been reduced so low, that there were no balances in hand, and that the service would actually be distressed for want of the vote before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00239"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that the charges of the country were going on, year after year, increasing. He would not, therefore, consent to vote a single shilling until the estimates were regularly before the House. He should be glad to hear whether the recent government had devoted any of its attention to the subject of economy. He did not object to the present ministry; nor would he oppose them, while they took a course likely to be beneficial to the country; but he did insist, that it was criminal to grant them any vote, until they declared what the expenditure of the whole year would be likely to require. There could be no difficulty, if ministers meant fairly, in their doing this. The right hon. Secretary opposite told the House, that it was the province of the sovereign
<image src="S2V0018P0I0163"/>
<col>311</col>
to recommend what the number of men wanted for the defence of the country should be. It might be the province of the sovereign to recommend; but it was for the House to decide whether that recommendation should be acquiesced in; and he, for one, was certainly disposed not to acquiesce in it, until the whole of the expense was before the House. The finance committee of 1817 had considered 19,000 men sufficient for the service of the country, and had held out a prospect of still further reduction. It was the duty of members to look at the enormous establishments of the present moment, and to be satisfied that they could not be dispensed with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00240">The House having resolved itself into the committee, sir G. Cockburn moved, "That 30,000 seamen, including 9,000 marines be granted for the service of the navy, for six months."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00241"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> opposed the grant, and declared that the legislature was going on, year after year, in a course of disgracefully wasteful expenditure, exceeding the income of the country, and making up the deficiency by the issue of Exchequer-bills. In 1792, the whole expenditure of the establishments of the country had been a little more than 5,000,000<i>l.</i> Now it amounted to 24,000,000<i>l.</i> It was impossible to go on tolerating this enormous and uncalled-for increase. He protested against this course, and would take an opportunity of putting his objection to it on record.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00242"><member>Sir J. Wrottesley</member><membercontribution> said, he could not allow this first vote to pass without making a few remarks. He did not so much object to the particular vote now before the committee, as to the fact, that they had not a full statement before them of the whole of the estimates. Great expectations were held out from the appointment of the finance committee. He hoped they would be realised; but he could not conceal his fears that this committee would be used, as former committees had been; that it would be made the 'scape-goat for the proposition of fresh taxes, which the ministry would not dare to propose on their own responsibility. He owned he had had great hopes that the right hon. gentleman, whose loss he, in common with the country, so sincerely deplored, would have been enabled to meet the financial difficulties of the country. Those difficulties could not now be concealed; yet at present he saw
<col>312</col>
no appearance of reduction. Last year we had a deficiency of 3,000,000<i>l.,</i> and he regretted to observe, that that deficiency was going on. In looking at our expenditure, he did not object to particular items, but to the general character of the whole. He did not think that the country could maintain the principles of free trade, while its expenditure was continued on its present scale. If he understood the principles on which we were endeavouring to carry on free trade, one of the means by which we were to do so was a reduction in the price of all articles of produce and manufacture, so as to meet the competition of other countries in the foreign market. In order to effect this, the price of provisions must be reduced, and the currency altered; the whole of the landed and manufacturing interests must submit to a reduction of their income by one-fourth or even one-third, to put the country in a condition to meet the new state of things. But, while such reductions were made, were those who were paid large salaries by the public to be the only exceptions? Was no reduction to be made in salaries, which were so heavy a burthen on the public? Many of those if compared with the salaries of 1792, and the price of provisions at that period, would be found fit items for reduction. It was impossible that the country could fulfil its engagements with the public creditor, unless reductions were made in our expenditure. The surplus of income above expenditure was 1,132,226<i>l.,</i> while the amount paid on account of the army and navy pensions was 2,800,000<i>l.</i> The fact was, that there was a real deficiency of between four and five millions. There was indeed, a sinking fund; but how was it made up? Not by a surplus of revenue but by borrowing. Would the country bear to be taxed to that amount, oppressed as it already was with such a load of taxation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00243"><member>Mr. John Wood</member><membercontribution> complained of the want of clearness in the accounts laid before the House. He thought that any two bankers' clerks well acquainted with business, could put them in a shape in which they could be understood. At present, they were nearly unintelligible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00244"><member>Mr. Maberly</member><membercontribution> said, that the amount of the sinking fund was now fixed at 5,000,000<i>l.</i> which must be provided for, whether there was an excess of income to that amount or not. As the act stood, it was impera-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0164"/>
<col>313</col>
tive to make good that sum as a sinking-fund, even should there be a deficiency of revenue. In the present year it was made up by a balance of income of 1,132,226<i>l.,</i> and the remainder by an issue of Exchequer-bills. This was not the fault of ministers, but of parliament; which said, that there should be a Sinking-fund to that amount, without reference to any excess of income. Parliament decreed, that there should be an extinction of the debt, to the amount of 5,000,000<i>l.</i> annually; and yet in fourteen days it departed from that principle, by voting a permanent charge of 2,800,000<i>l.</i> towards paying the army and navy pensions. He had no doubt, however, that the present year would be the last of that arrangement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00245"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, the hon. gentleman was correct in what he said respecting the Sinking-fund being payable out of the consolidated fund, whether there was or was not an excess of income. As to the army and navy pensions, the last instalment would be paid in July next, and it would be for the finance committee to consider that as well as the other branches of our expenditure. He thought there was nothing extraordinary in the vote now asked for; as it was usual to give ministers credit for a vote of this kind on their own responsibility. The increase of our naval force this year was not a subject for the consideration of a finance committee; and therefore no delay of the present vote could be necessary on that account. The question of the policy of that increase might be entered into at present, or at any future period; but the finance committee could not enter into the subject of the number of men which might be necessary. That was a part of its duty which, he was convinced, the House would not delegate to it. The amount of force necessary would be proposed by government, and the House would deal with it as it thought fit; but the finance committee would have nothing to do with it, though it might inquire as to the amount of expense by which such force could be maintained. As to the vote before the committee, he would only add, that whenever the subject of the treaty which had been referred to should come before the House, he should be ready to defend its policy, and to contend that it was not an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of an independent state, but that it was called for by circumstances which could be met in no other way.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00247">On the next resolution, "That 1,579,000<i>l.</i> be granted for paying and victualling the said men,"</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00248"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> complained of this attempt to vote money without notice having been given. In the notices of the day it was stated that a supply of seamen would be moved, but nothing was said about their wages or victuals. There was a considerable amount of unappropriated balances in the Exchequer, which the government might make use of without calling on that House for further sums, until the promised financial explanation had been given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00249"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, he was lost in astonishment at what had fallen from the hon. member. If he had not so often heard his voice in committees of supply, he should have supposed that it was some extremely young member who had entertained a notion, that, because there was a balance in the Exchequer, it was at the disposal of government. Did the hon. member know so little of the history of the constitution&#x2014;did he so little understand the character of a committee of supply&#x2014;as to suppose that, were there millions in the Exchequer, the government could touch a single shilling without a grant from parliament? The hon. member did not know the A, B, C of the progress of supply if he did not know the truth of this. If the hon. member had found out the secret of providing wages and victuals without money, he had indeed made a most brilliant discovery.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00250"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that if he had not yet learnt his A, B, C, he would endeavour to study his letters. He maintained, however, that the right hon. gentleman was wrong in the position which he took. The committee had only received notice that a vote of seamen would be moved for, and now they were called upon to grant money for their support, which was decidedly contrary to the practice of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00251"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> undertook to say, that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0165"/>
<col>315</col>
ever since the House had voted the wages and victuals of seamen, it had done so in precisely the same terms as those which the hon. member now asserted to be so irregular; with this exception, that the words "wear and tear" were formerly introduced, but had recently been omitted to please the hon. member himself. He defied the hon. member to prove that since the Revolution the House had ever omitted to vote wages and victuals, when the papers stated only that a certain number of seamen were to be voted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00252"><member>Mr. Croker</member><membercontribution> said, that the vote had been framed in the same manner as at present for the last nineteen years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00253"><member>Mr. Alderman Wood</member><membercontribution> said, it was hard upon his hon. friend to tell him that he did not know his A, B, C. He was sure his hon. friend did know his letters&#x2014;he meant so far as regarded taxation; for he knew nothing of his hon. friend's grammatical learning.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00254"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, he was not to be put down by such observations as had been addressed to him that night. If personalities were resorted to, he could retaliate. He still thought the motion improper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00255"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. member had certainly misunderstood what had fallen from his right hon. friend, if he supposed that he meant any thing personally offensive to him. He had merely stated, that the hon. member seemed to be unacquainted with the A, B, C, of the process of a committee of supply. There was nothing in that observation which ought to give the hon. member uneasiness.</membercontribution></p>

<title>COURT OF CHANCERY.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00257"><member>Mr. M. A. Taylor</member><membercontribution> said, he rose to renew his entreaty to the House, that they would again take into their earnest consideration the present state of the Court of Chancery. He could assure them that in any statement he might have to make, he did not intend to exaggerate the existing evil. Although he believed that the motion could not be objected to by any individual, still he thought it was only fair to the House and to the country to state, not, however, at any length, his view of the subject, and thus to place before the House the real evils of this court and to point out the
<col>316</col>
miseries which its suitors frequently endured&#x2014;miseries not confined to days or months, but which often extended to years, &#x2014;yes, to many years. Many of those suitors, to his own certain knowledge, were, in consequence of their having been kept in that court for years, either ruined in their circumstances or left to linger in a gaol. He thought it absolutely necessary to state to the House that for which he hoped every man would give him credit; namely, that he warred against no individual, that he had no personal hostility to any man who at present presided, or who had formerly presided, in that court. All he wished to attack was, the system; and he was convinced that the public felt with him as to the abuses of that court, which had increased, and gone on increasing, until the evil amounted to a denial of all justice. He knew very well that the member who brought forward to the notice of the House any material and real grievance in the administration of the law, had a great deal to contend with. He had reason to know that the evil was not assailed, but that the person exposing it was likely to be attacked. Some persons looked on it as quite horrible, to suppose for a moment that any individual had a right to meddle with an ancient system; and he recollected what had happened to himself some years ago, when in conjunction with an hon. friend of his, now no more, the late Mr. Ponsonby, who had been lord Chancellor of Ireland, he introduced a motion for an account of the fees taken in Chancery. He was then told by noble lords in the other House, that it was a horrible thing to institute such an inquiry. Many men thought it improper to interfere at all with an old system, sagaciously concluding, that because it was old it must necessarily be good. Another impediment was thrown in the way of those who desired reform, by the conduct of individuals who profited by the existing state of things; for they all knew that men did not like to give up great patronage and great emoluments. Patronage was, however, one thing, and emolument another; but if, by any act of his, or by any suggestion he might make, it appeared that the income of the lord Chancellor was likely not to prove sufficient, the public, he was sure, was not so niggardly as not to do the individual holding that office full justice.&#x2014;There was another reason why this subject had been so long suffered
<image src="S2V0018P0I0166"/>
<col>317</col>
to remain in its present unsettled state; and that was, because few people believed, that such an evil as that of the court of Chancery would ever come home to their own doors. They lulled themselves into perfect security on this point; but nothing could be more fallacious in principle or in practice than such an idea. No gentleman in that House could know how soon a bill in equity might be filed against him. He might be guardian to a minor; he might be an executor; he might be a creditor to any individual; and how long, being at the mercy of another, could a person so situated declare, with any degree of certainty, that he was not liable to be involved in a Chancery suit? Notwithstanding every exertion on his part&#x2014;notwithstanding the most upright and open-hearted conduct&#x2014;still he defied any man, situated as he had described, to know how long he might be able to escape such an infliction.<lb/>
Before he began any part of this subject, be begged leave to state distinctly to the House, that though he knew and was aware that some orders had recently been made with respect to the practice of the court of Chancery, yet he would not therefore desist from his exertions to reform that court. He understood that yesterday in the court of Chancery the lord Chancellor had said, that a variety of new resolutions had been framed, and orders had been given, in pursuance of the report of the commission which had been formed, by the king's command, some years ago. He, however, was not to be lulled into security by any such proceeding. A similar attempt was made in 1812, by the late lord Chancellor; and when he (Mr. Taylor) then carried the question in the House of Commons, the Chancellor said, it was impossible for him to go on with the business. His lordship might have said so much earlier; for he had known the fact long before. If the lord Chancellor added eighty, ninety, or a hundred orders to his list, it would not satisfy him; because he was convinced, that those orders would not rectify the evils of which he complained. Such a proceeding might have the effect of bringing on a cause a month or a couple of months sooner; but it would not give to the suitor that extensive remedy which he ought to have; therefore he hoped he should not be considered pertinacious, when he stated to the House and the country, that he would persevere
<col>318</col>
in his efforts, until he placed the suitor in the situation in which he ought to stand.<lb/>
After all the flattering hopes which had been given, that this court should be amended, what had been done? In 1809, he drew the attention of the House to the mischief that was produced by the court of Chancery. The government was, of course, opposed to him, on account of lord Eldon, who formed a prominent part of the then administration. Lord Eldon himself declared, that if he (Mr. Taylor) succeeded in the views which he entertained on this subject, he would be no longer lord chancellor of England; that was, in other words, that if he succeeded in finding out the cause of the delay, lord Eldon would resign the great seal and retire. Now, he would show the inconsistency of that noble lord's conduct. He did not choose to go over all the facts; but whatever he did feel it necessary to I state, he had the papers by him to refer I to, in corroboration of his statement. In 1811, he succeeded in carrying the committee of inquiry. The committee accordingly sat, and reported the arrears. In 1812, the committee was renewed; but how? With an influx of men brought in by the late Mr. Perceval; several of them masters in Chancery; very good men in their way; but the last persons that ought I to be employed in such an inquiry. The consequence was, that sir Samuel Romilly found it impossible to proceed; and why? Because the committee was appointed to report on the delay, and to state the number of causes in arrear; but when he (Mr.; Taylor) called on them to examine into ' the cause of that delay, it was immediately said, "No, no: that sacred ground I must not be touched; the lord Chancellor must not be interfered with on that point." The consequence was, that he found himself in a minority of seven. He then applied to the House to give further instructions to the committee; but that was refused. The House divided on the proposition, which was this, "That it be a special instruction to the committee, to examine persons practising at the bar, as well I as solicitors, touching the causes of the delay in the court of Chancery." That proposition was lost. He had carried his first motion, for an inquiry; but then, said the minister, "You shall not inquire into I the causes of the delay." What, then, he asked, was the use of the committee? Sir Samuel Romilly, in consequence, said at
<image src="S2V0018P0I0167"/>
<col>319</col>
once&#x2014;" We must give the business up; "and he was not at all surprised at it. In 1819, he (Mr. Taylor) moved for an account of the effects of suitors in Chancery, which was granted. He then moved, "That this House, at an early period next session, do enter into a consideration of the proceedings in the court of Chancery." There he was left in a minority of fifty-two to fifty-six. Mr. John Williams afterwards, in 1823, moved for an inquiry into the state of the court of Chancery, which was negatived by one hundred and seventy-four to eighty-nine. In 1824, the motion was made and agreed to, praying that his majesty would be pleased to appoint a commission to inquire into the causes of the delay in the court of Chancery: and in 1826, the report of the commissioners was made. But, from that time to the present, not one vestige appeared of any thing, founded upon that report, having been done. Two bills had indeed been introduced, the one comprising much less than the other; but they had not been pressed forward. One of them was moved by the present lord Chancellor, who said that he would consult him (Mr. Taylor) on the subject; but from that hour to this the bill had been dropped, and the court remained just as it had been; and they were now told, that the bill was not to be renewed. In the debate of that bill it was clearly shown, that, except the payment of the salaries of the masters, the measure did nothing that could not be carried into effect by the order of the lord Chancellor. It had now slept for years; and what was the reason of this delay? Why, it was this:&#x2014;the lord Chancellor, who, in 1826, thought that certain alterations ought to be made in the court by act of parliament, had changed his opinion, and did not now think it necessary. He well knew lord Eldon's merits, and his value: there was not, he believed, a greater lawyer; and if he had presided in the King's-bench, where three other judges must sit along with him, he had no doubt but that he would have given prompt decisions; but his time was employed in various ways. He was a political character, and when called on to attend in the Cabinet, off he immediately went from his court. He was convinced, that if lord Eldon, instead of doubting and delaying, had given his judgment on the first view of a case, that judgment would have been generally right: for no man had a more
<col>320</col>
accurate insight into the law affecting property than he had. But, instead of deciding at once, cases were delayed until the nature of them was forgotten: years passed away, and the parties were ruined. Lord Eldon persuaded the House of Lords, and afterwards the House of Commons, that a vice Chancellor's court ought to be erected to lessen the business of the court of Chancery. To that measure he (Mr. Taylor) was not favourable. He was anxious to lighten the burthens of the court: of Chancery, by separating the bankruptcy cases from the equity jurisdiction. In endeavouring to effect that object, he had the assistance of one of the ablest men that ever sat in that House&#x2014;the late Mr. Canning; and, though some had doubted it, he could confidently assert that he had also the assistance of the late sir Samuel Romilly. They both felt that the only way in which the court could be effectually relieved was by appointing a separate judge for the adjudication of bankrupt cases. Another plan was adopted to lessen the labours of the lord Chancellor, by causing the Speaker of the House of Lords to expedite the Scotch Appeals. This, it was supposed, would enable the lord Chancellor to devote three more clays in the week to the disposal of equity cases. Let the House mark the assistance which the late lord Chancellor had obtained. He had said, that he wanted no assistance; yet all the assistance which he (Mr. Taylor) had enumerated, that noble lord had himself procured.<lb/>
He would now inquire what was the state of the Court, before lord Eldon had gained that assistance, and what was it at present? In 1811, when the committee of inquiry was granted, there stood on the Chancery paper one hundred and fourteen causes, there were forty further directions, and fifty-nine exceptions and demurrers; amounting in the whole to two hundred and thirteen. In 1827, with all this additional assistance, the numbers stood thus&#x2014;there were three hundred and sixteen causes now in the Court, one hundred and forty-four exceptions, seventeen pleas and demurrers, forty-nine for re-hearing; so that instead of two hundred and thirteen cases standing over for further directions, &amp;c, there were actually, notwithstanding all the additional assistance, five hundred and twenty-six causes. He therefore had a right to say, that the Court had really gained nothing by the alterations. After
<image src="S2V0018P0I0168"/>
<col>321</col>
seventeen, eighteen, or nineteen, years of perseverance in endeavours to ameliorate the court of Chancery, the Court had not got one step forward. And why? Because the judge who sat there was a political judge, intimately connected with a party, and therefore it was impossible for him to attend to his judicial duties. Now, whatever his political opinions might be, he had an abhorence of a political judge; and he believed, from the bottom of his heart, that the business of the Chancery would never be carried on for the benefit of the suitors, without some court of equity being established by commission, having judges totally unconnected with politics, and in no way charged with the responsibility of advising the Crown. He could give a striking proof that the attention paid to political feeling greatly retarded the business of the court. Many years ago, when he practised at the bar, the great seal was put in commission; he believed for the last time. Lord Chief-justice Eyre, Mr. Justice Ashurst, and Mr. Justice Wilson, were the commissioners for the great seal, and the business went on with rapidity. The great seal was, after a time, handed to lord Loughborough, and his majesty inquired of the commissioners what business remained in the court. Lord Chief-justice Eyre answered, that if his majesty had ordered him to attend at half past three instead of two o'clock, there would not have been a cause to be disposed of in the court&#x2014;neither a bankrupt petition, an exception, or a motion; but for want of time, the commissioners had been obliged to leave one. When lord Loughborough, then chief-justice of the Common Pleas, Mr. Baron Hotham, and sir W. Ashurst, were commissioners for keeping the great seal, there never was a cause that passed over one day, which was not decided the next morning. But when lord Loughborough became Chancellor, the business of the court fell into arrear. He therefore contended, that unless some additional power was given to the Court, by the appointment of one or two judges, between whom the business should be subdivided, or by the adoption of some other efficacious plan, it was quite impossible that the arrear of business could ever be overcome. He asked, then, whether, after the exertions of so many years, the public had gained or lost? He said decidedly, that the public had lost.<lb/>
Before he stated his case, he wished to
<col>322</col>
point out to the House a most extraordinary circumstance in the practice of that Court, with which a professional gentleman had furnished him. He did not introduce it as exemplifying the general practice of the Court; but to show, that, unless some assistance was given to the Court&#x2014;unless power was given to the judge to repress improper acts,&#x2014;gross abuses might be committed with impunity. He alluded to the case of "Brown and De Tastet," which was still going on. It was a very curious case, and showed how a suit might be drawn out, and how a bill might be amended almost to the end of time. This was a suit which was to be heard on petition. The original bill was amended, and re-amended, and supplementarily amended, and re-amended, and again supplementarily amended. Now, he did not say that such practice formed the general rule of the court, but it proved how easily abuses might be committed. In 1816, an action connected with this case was commenced, and, in consequence of the witnesses being abroad, it was attended with considerable delay. In 1819, the trial was stayed, to the great indignation of the defendant's attorney, who declared that his client ought not to be so treated; that he cared not for the order of the lord Chancellor; that he would keep the business in court for ten years; that it never should be finished during his life, or until his opponent was ruined. In 1819 a bill was filed, containing five hundred and sixty-six folios; on the 27th of October following, the plaintiff obtained an order to amend that bill; in November following, the bill was amended, with six hundred and two folios; on the 10th of November an answer was put in; in December an order was obtained to amend the answer; on the 4th of December, a second answer of four hundred and thirty-five folios was filed; on the 26th of December, a supplemental bill was filed. Not less than ten thousand, four hundred and ninety-seven folios were drawn up in the course of two years. On the 22nd of April 1821, the Vice-chancellor said he would go on with the case and decide it. In July, 1821, a supplemental bill was filed. In 1824 another supplemental bill was filed;&#x2014;and by whom?&#x2014;by a living being? No by a dead man. Why was this admitted? Because it was some time before the other party knew whether the individual was living or dead. The attorney, however, took advantage of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0169"/>
<col>323</col>
circumstance, and said, "Though Mr. Da Costa be dead, yet he shall live in my bill." When it was found out that this gentleman was dead, the bill was taken off the file of course. "Ay," said the defendant, "but I have another resource: there was a commission&#x2014;I will revive it, and put it on the file in the name of the assignees." There it stood till the fraud was discovered. Such was the proceeding in this cause during the last ten years; and yet the attorney was not struck off the rolls of the court&#x0021;<lb/>
When such a state of things existed, what use was there, after seventeen or eighteen years' consideration, to come down to the House with eighteen or nineteen resolutions, and to say to the suitors; "Oh, we will give you a little relief that will jog your cause on a month or so." But he must say, that such relief availed nothing; since it would not effectually correct the evils engendered by the practice of the Court. Gentlemen might suppose that when a cause was heard, there was an end of it. But the hearing was, in fact, only the beginning of the business. The Chancellor sent the cause to the Master to examine it; and when it came from him, it was set down for hearing, and there it might remain for months and months. When the present Master of the Rolls was Vice-chancellor, he saw the difficulty of getting through the business, and he hastened the proceedings. But, with all his despatch, he found, after he had sat for eighteen or nineteen months, that there was a great arrear of causes for further direction, after coming from the Master's office.<lb/>
The hon. and learned gentleman then adverted to the inconvenience, nay, to the positive evil, &#x2014;which legatees were subjected to, under the present practice of the court of Chancery. A testator dying, might leave to his wife and children a certain sum charged on his estate. Now if the executor happened to be a litigious man, he might prevent the legacies from being paid for seven years after he got possession of the property. This was a case of common occurrence. In cases where there was an immense property concerned, the Master would sometimes make a separate report; and if he did this, the Chancellor acting upon that report, would grant a proper maintenance: but, if the Master did not make a separate report, the widow and the children might remain without
<col>324</col>
a sixpence for seven years. In cases where a man left legacies chargeable upon his personal estate, several years must, of necessity, elapse before the legatees could obtain them, if the executors thought proper to throw obstacles in their way. And when all this was said, what sort of answer did they get? Why, they were told that it was the course of the court&#x0021; But why was it the course of the court? Only for this reason&#x2014;because when causes were ready for hearing there was not a sufficient number of judges to hear them.<lb/>
He did not wish to trouble the House unnecessarily with details, but there was another case to which he must call their attention. He was afraid he was tiresome, but it was necessary for him to display clearly the broad ground upon which he felt himself justified in coming to the determination which he begged now once more to declare; namely, that he never would leave this question until he had seen justice done. The case to which he had to call the attention of the House was the case of "Green and Jackson," which arose out of money having been left to certain charities, contrary to the statute of Mortmain. The question was of the most plain and simple nature, yet it was still in court, and he would show that no decision could be got even upon this simple question, until the year 1830. He desired the Mouse perfectly to understand that he had resources from which he was able to derive information upon the subject on which he was now speaking. He begged the House not to suppose that he, who had left the bar five and thirty years, depended upon his own information, or upon his own researches. No; he had resources; they were men of high repute and standing in the court of which he was speaking. To name them would be a sufficient guarantee for the accuracy of his statements; but that, he believed, would not be very regular in that place. The very facts, however, which he stated, or at least many of them, had been mentioned to lord Lyndhurst himself by these very gentlemen. The case to which he was just alluding was this:&#x2014;John Chapman, by his will dated the 7th of February, 1816, gave certain gifts and legacies to different charities, which, as he had before observed, were clearly void. The heir at law and next of kin filed a bill, in 1819, to have it declared, that the gifts and legacies were void. The defendants&#x2014;the trustees
<image src="S2V0018P0I0170"/>
<col>325</col>
of the charities&#x2014;put in their answers in 1820; and very soon after &#x2014;that was in the same year&#x2014;the trustees and executors, who had the funds in their hands, put in their answer also. In the same year, also, the bill was amended, by making other defendants parties, who speedily put in their answers. In November, 1820, subpoenas to rejoin were served; and in the beginning of 1821, the cause was set down. In December, 1821, the cause was heard, and it was referred to the Master to inquire who was the heir-at-law, and who were the next of kin of the testator. The Master reported, that the plaintiff's were such heir-at-law and next of kin. The cause was then heard for the first time, on further directions, in 1823; and it was again referred to the Master to take an account of the property in dispute. On the 25th of August, 1824, the Master made his report as to the amount of the property. On the 21st of January, 1825, the cause was ordered to be set down for further directions. On the 11th of December, 1826, twenty-three months after the cause was in a condition to be heard a second time on further directions, the Vice-chancellor again referred it to the Master, to inquire what children of the testator's half-nephews were living, and who were the representatives of such as were dead; his honour being of opinion, that he could not decide in their absence. At this present time, that is to say, in February, 1828, the Master was still occupied in prosecuting this inquiry. Now, supposing that the cause should be set down again in June, it would not be until May, 1830&#x2014;nearly ten years from the time when the cause was first set down to be heard&#x2014;that the cause could be finally determined. Ten years, then, had been wasted upon a question in which there was no difficulty whatever&#x2014;which might have been decided in less than an hour&#x2014;which the merest driveller at the bar could have entertained no doubt upon. In this case it appeared, that no blame could be thrown upon the solicitors. Six years of the delay was solely attributable to the Court not being able to hear causes quickly in its several stages; and this the Court about which they had had a report.<lb/>
He had read the report through, and he would say, that a greater tissue of nonsense was never before strung together. Nay, every body agreed that such was its character. Nobody could help laughing at it; and he was only surprised that any
<col>326</col>
set of men could have brought themselves to put it forth. And when he had said this before many very excellent men in the profession&#x2014;and he could assure the House that with such persons he had frequently conversed upon the subject&#x2014;they did not attempt to deny it. No; they agreed with him, and all they could say upon the matter was, "Yes, but you know the Chancellor was there&#x2014;the Chancellor was in the commission." Certainly he knew the Chancellor was there; and he would ask why he was allowed to be there? It was perfectly clear, perfectly notorious, how they had marshalled their men in that coin-mission,&#x2014;how they had fixed cautiously upon particular men, and excluded others with equal caution. He did not mean to say that the name of such an humble individual as himself was of sufficient importance to attract the notice and attention of his majesty's government; but then he must remind the House, that in other cases it had always been customary to include the persons with whom the subject originated. He, however, who had been the means of having the commission appointed, was left out. He was very well aware why they had left him out. They knew, that if he had been among them, he would have unravelled the whole question; while, as it was, the Chancellor had no one to say to him, "This evidence is not correct, &#x2014;this statement is not true." He did not blame those who did not adopt the course which he should have adopted; but he would tell what he knew to be the reason for the omission of his name in the coin-mission. No doubt they said, "We won't have that plaguy, troublesome, litigious fellow, Michael Angelo Taylor among us." Mr. Williams, then? "No: Mr.' Williams makes very clever speeches,&#x2014;is a very stirring man; but he, too, will unravel the whole business,&#x2014;we must not have him among us." And who had they after all? Why, there was, for instance, Mr. Robert Smith, a very able man, no doubt; and a man, too, who had the misfortune to sit on the opposition side of the House as long as he had. He had practised in India, if he was not mistaken; but then he knew no more about the practice of a court of Equity, than he (Mr. Taylor) did of commanding a fleet of twenty sail of the line. Then there was Dr. Lushington, a civil lawyer, and a very able man, but who knew nothing about the court of Chancery. Indeed, his hon.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0171"/>
<col>327</col>
and learned friend must have had all the business to learn, when he found himself placed in such a situation. Then there was lord Eldon. His lordship sat there like an humble private individual, and every body knew what he wanted, and what his opinion of the whole commission was. He begged to say most explicitly and distinctly&#x2014;for he did not wish to be misunderstood&#x2014;that the whole object, in the selection and appointment of that commission was, that no blame should be laid upon the Chancellor for delay [cheers.] He thought that if that great judge had decided according to the means he possessed, a considerable portion of the grievances now complained of would never have existed.<lb/>
For his own part, he was not very much inclined to give counsel to the House. That was an office which he had no wish ever to take upon him: but, on the present occasion, if they would allow him, he would give them a little counsel, and he did it without hesitation, because it originated with an illustrious individual whose authority was always listened to with respect. The great man to whom he alluded was lord chancellor Bacon, who, though unfortunately not the purest and most upright of men, was possessed of learning, talents, and discernment, rarely equalled, and perhaps never surpassed. In the times in which lord Bacon lived it was the custom for the king, when he delivered the great seal into the hands of the person whom he had fixed upon to hold it, to add a charge, which consisted of some words of caution and advice. When the lord chancellor, or lord keeper, took his seat upon the bench, he was accompanied, as was the habit now, by many of the nobility, and persons filling high situations. When king James delivered to sir Francis Bacon the great seal, he gave him four cautions; and the lord keeper in his speech, on taking his seat in the court of Chancery, accompanied by several distinguished personages, alluded to some points well worthy the attention of the House. <i>Non meus hic sermo.</i> The lord keeper spoke thus:&#x2014;"The king's charge, which is my lantern, rested upon four heads:&#x2014;1st, That I should contain the jurisdiction of the Court within its true and due limits, without swelling or excess." He could have wished that other chancellors had paid attention to this advice of "containing the jurisdiction of the court within due
<col>328</col>
limits, without swelling or excess. If they had, the public would not, in all probability, have heard so much of opera-houses and theatres in the court of Chancery. The lord keeper went on&#x2014;2nd, "That I should retrench all unnecessary delays, that the subject might find that he did enjoy the same remedy against the fainting of the soul, and the consumption of the estate, which was speedy justice&#x2014; <i>Bis dat, qui cito dat.</i>" True it was, that speedy justice was every thing, and a great pity it was that that did not appear to be the maxim of every one. Many persons had come to him since he had first taken up the question of the court of Chancery, and stated to him the nature of their cases and the hardships they had experienced from delay&#x2014;from those "unnecessary delays" which it was his object to retrench. But these persons, when they mentioned their cases to him, had at the same time begged of him not to mention their names, lest they should suffer in consequence the displeasure of the Court. He had not mentioned their names, but he had searched out and inquired into their cases, and found that they had almost invariably truly stated them to him. In the gaols of the country&#x2014;in the ruin of many individuals&#x2014;of whole families&#x2014;they had abundant instances of the "fainting of the soul" for want of the remedy which the lord keeper had so well described. Speedy justice was all that he asked for, and if the commission had been appointed to inquire into the wrongs inflicted upon the suitors of the court of Chancery, instead of the purpose for which it was appointed, speedy justice would have been obtained. The third head to which the lord keeper alluded was this&#x2014;"That justice might pass with as easy a charge as might be; and that these same brambles that grow about justice, of needless charge and expense, and all manner of exactions, might be rooted out so far as might be." Did justice now pass at an easy charge? Look at the cost of proceedings in the court of Chancery, as it was at present constituted. The lord keeper continued&#x2014;"These commands are righteous, and, as I may term them, sacred." Speaking afterwards of speedy justice, he says, "it rests much upon myself and much upon others. For myself, I am resolved that my decree shall come speedily, if not instantly, after the hearing&#x2014;and my signed decree, speedily upon my decree being
<image src="S2V0018P0I0172"/>
<col>329</col>
pronounced; for fresh justice is the sweetest."&#x2014;For the fourth and last point of the king's commandment, "for the cutting off unnecessary charge upon the subject, a great portion of it is fulfilled in the precedent article, for it is the length of suits that doth multiply charges chiefly."<lb/>
This was advice which it would indeed be wise to follow: these were resolves which it would have been well if lord Bacon and every succeeding chancellor, had put into execution. He must beg of the House not to look upon this as a party question. It was no such thing: it was perfectly unconnected with party. Let the House only look at the state of the public feeling upon this question, and then ask themselves if it had any thing to do with party. When he had used this argument it had been said, "then why are not petitions presented to the House?" If he chose, he could load the table with petitions. The reason he had not done so was this. He had been told that it would not be fair to take such a course, and therefore he disdained to take what might be called an unfair advantage. He had said, "let the public, then, judge for themselves," and so he said still; but he felt it right to state publicly in his place, that if he had not more assistance given him upon I this question&#x2014;which he again said he; never would leave&#x2014;than he had received for the last seventeen years, the public must, come forward, and tell the House, in language which could not be misunderstood, what their feeling on the subject was. He must again remind the House of the words of lord Bacon.&#x2014;"As to speedy justice it rests much upon myself." His resolution, too, respecting his decree, could not be too frequently or too strongly impressed upon the minds of judges. There were numerous instances to show the danger and cruelty of not entertaining, or of not adhering to (which was the same thing), his resolution. Many cases in the court of Chancery had lain over three or four years for judgment. The maxim, that "fresh justice was the sweetest," seemed to have been for some time totally exploded from the court of Chancery. He must, however, call upon the leading minister in that House to consider this question seriously and attentively&#x2014;to look into it himself; to judge of it himself, by the evidence which he may be able to collect, and to tell him (Mr. Taylor) whether his view
<col>330</col>
was not correct. He had every confidence in that right hon. gentleman, and he did, therefore, earnestly call upon him to examine and to judge for himself; not to take the opinion of the law-officers or even of the lord Chancellor, but to be guided by his own judgment, and to be influenced by nothing but what he saw to be true. This was no time for trifling measures. They were already paying dearly enough for living in a free country. For his own part, he did not care how dearly, but this he would say, give him what he had a right to demand&#x2014;give him justice&#x2014;give him speedy justice [cheers]. He had no wish to speak in any thing but terms of respect of the government; but he could not help declaring, that that government did not act honestly by the country, if it refused this. A few resolutions were of no use: they would effect nothing. The court must be cleansed by proper and efficient means, and the wrongs must not be trifled with by a voluminous report, which was waste paper, or worse than waste paper&#x2014;the greatest mockery he ever beheld, <i>" Nulli negabimus, nulli differemus, nulli vendemus justitiam vel rectum.</i>" Let the House recollect these words, and say if this Magna Charta was not violated most grossly by the present system of the court of Chancery. He said that justice was denied, and that this was the grossest case that had ever been brought before that House. Ruin had been the result of this system in many cases; and yet it was still endeavoured to uphold it. He had read several pamphlets upon the subject. They were of a most, extraordinary kind. The men must have been in the moon when they wrote them. They told him, that people must wait two or three years, and that there was no hardship in such delay. It was unnecessary to reply to such nonsense.<lb/>
He was afraid that he had already tired the House; but his desire to remedy the present system had led him to trespass longer upon their attention than he had at first intended. He would add little more than a statement of the papers which he was desirous of having produced. If he were asked, what specific remedy he had to propose, he should reply that that was a question to be considered hereafter. The simple question he had to ask was this, &#x2014;Was the present state of the court of Chancery such as the country would
<image src="S2V0018P0I0173"/>
<col>331</col>
tolerate? If it be not,&#x2014;and it would be found that it was not,&#x2014;then they were sacrificing the interests of the public to the personal aggrandizement of a few individuals. He was free to confess that in his opinion, the separation of the jurisdiction in bankruptcy from the great seal would go very considerably towards removing much of the present grievances. The jurisdiction in bankruptcy was not originally attached to the great seal, but belonged to the lords of the Treasury. It did not now pass with the great seal, but was superadded to it by the statute. What objection, then, could there be to separate it from the great seal? He would only just state, that in 1811, when he moved for a committee to inquire into the causes of the delays of the court, of Chancery, there were two hundred and odd bankrupt petitions in the court, and that now there were nearly five hundred. In the last return he had received they were stated at four hundred and fifty. Many of these petitions took up no less than three or four days each; so that the judges had really not time enough to get through the business before them. His hon. and learned friend (Mr. Brougham) had, in the speech which he had lately made, and to the eloquence and research of which the House had listened with so much delight, alluded to the disparity between the business of the court and the number of the judges, and showed what excellent results might be expected from a more just division of labour. And it was by the same process of reasoning that he (Mr. Taylor) had become convinced, that his notion with respect to the jurisdiction in bankruptcy was well founded. It was founded upon the conviction, that there was too much business for the present number of judges to get through. If a judge were appointed for matters connected with bankruptcy, that class of business would be much better done, and the judge might also take other business, which would greatly relieve the court. But he was not partial to any particular mode of reform; only let there be some reform. Let the government take the matter in hand seriously and diligently. They had much better means of information than he could possibly have: they had the advantage of the advice and experience of the law officers; and if his humble assistance would be of any service, it should always be at their command. But let it be per
<col>332</col>
fectly understood, that if the government did not take it up, he should continue his exertions. He never would give this subject up, because he was sure that he stood upon ground from which no man could expel him: because he was sure that he rested upon a prop which no man could take from under him [cheers]. If he divided only with five or with three, still he would divide. The number should not discourage him; and he now moved for the production of these papers, because he was determined to show to the House and to the country what the real state of this court was, and thus leave them no hope either of turning their backs upon the question or of avoiding it by half measures and insufficient remedies, whose only end was to amuse and pacify, and not to put an end to an evil than which he knew of no greater. He had to beg pardon for having trespassed so long upon the House, and would conclude by moving, for "An account of the numbers of re-hearings and appeals; of the number of causes; of the number of pleas and demurrers; and of the number of bankrupt petitions before the judges of the court of Chancery, on the 1st day of Hilary term, 1828."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00258"><member>The Solicitor-General</member><membercontribution> said, he saw no possible objection to the motion. Indeed, without the most detailed information it would be impossible to give any correct opinion upon the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00259"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> thought, the public were much indebted to his hon. friend, the member for Durham, for his persevering efforts to call the attention of parliament to the defects and abuses of the court of Chancery, with a view to their remedy; but he confessed, that he was not prepared to give his assent, from any thing he had heard either upon that or a former occasion, to the main project of his hon. friend, and which he held forth as a cure for the evils of which he complained; namely, the separation of the jurisdiction in bankruptcy, from the great seal. From the vast importance of the cases decided in bankruptcy, involving the most, difficult questions of law and equity, and on which interest of the greatest magnitude to the commercial world depended, he (Mr. F.) was convinced, that they never would be satisfied with the decision, in such cases of any but the highest authority; and although in this department of bankruptcy as well as others, the lord Chancel
<image src="S2V0018P0I0174"/>
<col>333</col>
lor might require aid and assistance which he has not now, he (Mr. F.) was disposed to think, that the final judgment in cases of bankruptcy could not safely be taken out of the hands of the lord Chancellor and transferred to any judge or court of inferior jurisdiction or authority.&#x2014;No man was more convinced than himself, that the court of Chancery, as at present constituted, was unequal to the despatch of the immense and daily increasing business, which poured in upon it, and with which it was oppressed. His hon. friend had shewn the number of cases of all description snow depending in Chancery, compared with those which were depending in 1811. They were as five hundred and twenty-six to two hundred and thirteen, notwithstanding the assistance, which had been derived from the appointment of a Vice-chancellor in 1812. This did not certainly give all the information which the House might require, as to the causes which operated in producing the present state of business in the court of Chancery; for by not shewing the length of time during which those causes had been depending, it could not be said what part of the accumulation might have been occasioned by delay in deciding, and what part of it by the increase of litigation. He believed, that a great part; of it would be found to have arisen from the latter cause; and that, even, supposing that the appointment of the Vice-chancellor, at the time when it was first made, might be considered to have been sufficient to afford the relief then required, he believed it would be found, that further aid was required at the present time, and that three judges in Chancery were wholly insufficient to despatch the business of that court, and that a fourth judge would be required, with original jurisdiction, not with a jurisdiction derivative merely from the will of the lord Chancellor, and by reference from him, such as the jurisdiction of the Vice-chancellor; a defect which, in respect of the Vice-chancellor, was intended to be remedied by the bill introduced by the present lord Chancellor when Master of the Rolls, during the last session of parliament, and which bill as well as the labour of the Commission on which it was founded, had met with so little mercy from the hon. member for Durham. He agreed with his hon. friend, that that bill did not do all that was required; but he could not agree with him that it did
<col>334</col>
nothing, or that it did nothing but what the lord Chancellor might have done by order in his court. It did some things no doubt, which it was nearly ludicrous to call in the assistance of King, Lords and Commons to do: for instance, to compel the examiner, in taking down the depositions of witnesses to leave out the words this deponent saith, or "the deponent further saith," and to use in their stead the pronoun, "I" giving the evidence, as the witness did, in the first and not in the third person; an order which the lord Chancellor might certainly have given to his clerks without the sanction of the legislature.&#x2014;But many of the provisions of the bill, as well in respect of the order therein proposed to be made as of its enacting clauses, could not have been carried into effect, or made law, without the authority of parliament. He would instance the change proposed to be made in the writs of subpoena, in the jurisdiction of the Vice-chancellor, and in the power proposed to be given to the courts of law to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses, in cases where otherwise recourse must have been had to a bill in equity to obtain such a commission. In respect to the bill which had been introduced into the House by the present lord Chancellor, he could testify that, if that bill had not been carried through the House, it was not the fault of that noble person, who attended very assiduously in order to carry it through its different stages in that House, and who delayed the second reading of the bill from time to time, not for his own convenience, but to accommodate professional gentlemen, whose avocations, particularly their calls on the circuits would have prevented them from giving their attendance on that occasion.&#x2014;The bill did not, however, in his (Mr. F's.) opinion, go far enough. It did not even go so far as the suggestions of the commissioners would have warranted; those commissioners, whose labours had been held so cheap by the hon. member for Durham, but which he could not view altogether in the same light with his hon. friend.&#x2014;He considered their labours to have been most meritorious, and their suggestions of the greatest practical utility.&#x2014;If they did not go further than they did, let it be recollected, that they were limited in their inquiry by the terms of their commission. But will it be said, that they have suggested nothing whereby the expense and delay of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0175"/>
<col>335</col>
Chancery proceedings may be lessened usefully and beneficially to the suitor of the court? Take for instance the means suggested by the commissioners, and adopted in the bill, of compelling a plaintiff to proceed in the suit or to have his bill dismissed.&#x2014;By the present practice, after a defendant has fully answered the plaintiff's bill, he cannot move to have it dismissed for want of precaution, although the plaintiff shall not have taken a step in the cause for a period of nearly three quarters of a year,&#x2014;and when such motion is made, and the plaintiff is obliged to undertake to speed the cause, he satisfies this undertaking for speed, by filing his replication, which gives him about three quarters of a year more, without in the least advancing the progress of the cause; and it is only upon the second motion to dismiss the bill that the plaintiff, after a delay of a year and a half, must undertake to" speed the cause with effect," that is to proceed in his cause with due diligence. The commissioners have proposed that there should be but one order, that is, "to speed the cause with effect" thus saving expense to both parties, and to the defendant a vexatious delay of a year and a half in a single stage of the proceedings of a Chancery suit. By this and other alterations proposed by the commissioners, particularly in respect of appeals, it was not too much to say, that besides the great expense that would be saved to the parties, four or five years of the delay with which a vexatious litigant can now harass and oppress his adversary in any suit, would be prevented.&#x2014;The suggestion of the commissioners, that there should be but one appeal from the decision of the Master of the Rolls or the Vice-chancellor; that is, to the lord Chancellor or to the House of Lords at the option of the appellant, is a most important one. It was not adopted in the bill, but it was understood that the matter of appeals was to form the subject of another bill to be introduced into the House of Lords, the proper place certainly for originating a measure in which their own appellate jurisdiction was so directly concerned.&#x2014;It was understood, that the present lord Chancellor was now occupied in framing such orders as could be part of his own authority, with a view to remedy; the evils complained of. There was no person so much interested in reforming the abuses of his court as the lord Chancellor himself; and he (Mr. F.) believed,
<col>336</col>
that that noble person was sincere and honest in his intention to effect that reform. &#x2014;But the aid of the legislature will no doubt be required to carry that intention fully into effect; and he could not believe, as his hon. friend did, that the intention to have recourse to legislative interference, has been abandoned.&#x2014;Whatever cannot be done by the authority of the lord Chancellor must be effected (and much will remain to be effected) by legislative enactment.&#x2014; In revising the constitution of the court of Chancery it might be well worth considering, whether the functions of the lord high Chancellor of England would not be most beneficially, and indeed almost necessarily, exercised as a judge of appeal, an additional judge being added for the transacting of the ordinary business of the court.&#x2014;He (Mr. F.) took the opportunity of expressing his satisfaction at the declaration which had been lately made by the lord Chancellor, that he would himself hear the appeals from Scotland.&#x2014;Nothing could be more unsatisfactory, than the manner in which those cases had been disposed of in the last session of parliament. &#x2014;If there was one object more than another, which was essential to secure in the constitution of the court of appeal in the last resort, it was uniformity of decision.&#x2014; But how could this be secured, when the law was to be expounded one day by the lord Chancellor, another by the lord Chief Baron, and a third by the Master of the Rolls;&#x2014;all excellent judges, but judges who might differ in their opinions and in their judgments, where it was essential that there should be but one opinion and one judgment. He knew, that this mode of deciding appeals from Scotland had given great dissatisfaction in that country; not from any doubt of the learning and ability of any of the judges whom he had mentioned, but from the uncertainty, which must necessarily exist in respect to the decision of these separate judges, each deciding in the last resort; two of them, without having it in their power to give a single reason in support of a judgment, theirs in every thing but power, and which might go to reverse the unanimous decision of the judges of Scotland, who might in vain seek for the arguments on which that reversal was founded.&#x2014;Thanks was due from the profession of the law, and from the public of Scotland, to the lord Chancellor, who had declared his intention to put an end to this unsatisfactory and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0176"/>
<col>337</col>
not very decorous mode of proceeding.&#x2014;Of that noble lord he (Mr. F.) would say, that various and important and laborious as were the duties which he had to discharge, he knew of no person who had a mind and understanding more equal to grasp the whole range of the duties, and to master and overcome the difficulties that attended them. No individual, perhaps, ever brought to the discharge of those duties more useful faculties.&#x2014;Acute and penetrating, he is remarkable for the patience and attention with which he listens to the statements and arguments which are submitted to him.&#x2014;Perhaps no one has more the talent of separating the material and important points, from those which are immaterial and extraneous, and of thus arriving at a prompt and correct judgment founded on the real and substantial merits of the case.&#x2014;He (Mr. F.) had little doubt that his hon. friend, the member for Durham, would see reasons to be satisfied with the conduct of that noble and learned lord, in respect to the question in which that hon. member felt so much interest that the result of the labours in which the lord Chancellor is now engaged with a view to a reform in the proceedings of the court of Chancery would be such as to call forth the praise and approbation of his hon. friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00260"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that, it was desirable to postpone any discussion of the question, until the papers moved for by the hon. and learned gentleman had been produced. So far was the lord Chancellor from having abandoned the principle of the bill which he had introduced into that House, that it was his intention to issue forty or fifty orders founded on the recommendations of the commission. In his (Mr. Peel's) opinion, it was better to look forward to future amelioration, than to revive the discussions to which the report of the commission had given rise. He certainly, however, could not think that the composition of that commission had been objectionable, because there were persons belonging to it, who were unconnected with the court of Chancery. Had it been otherwise, he was persuaded that an objection would have been made to the constitution of the commission, and that, the usefulness of having persons upon it who were embarrassed by no professional prepossessions would have been warmly urged. There was one matter of great importance in the hon. gentle-
<col>338</col>
man's speech on which he would not at present touch; namely, the expediency of divesting the lord Chancellor of all political character, and of confining himself to his duties as an equity judge. Whether it was not desirable that there should be in the cabinet an officer of great judicial importance; and if desirable, whether it would be advantageous that that officer should be of a lower rank than the lord Chancellor, were questions on which he would not then touch. Nor would he say a word on the subject of separating the bankruptcy from the Chancery jurisdiction. The confession of the hon. gentleman with respect to the complication of the business imposed upon the lord Chancellor, and the impossibility that any one man could satisfactorily get through it, would at least serve to acquit his noble and learned friend by whom that high situation had lately been held of the charges which had been brought against, him. It now appeared, even by the admission of the hon. mover himself, that the delays which had taken place in the court of Chancery were not matters of personal charge against his noble and learned friend; but might be justly accounted for by circumstances which were entirely beyond his control. He mentioned this in justice to one to whom justice had hitherto not been done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00261"><member>Mr. G.

He protested, too, against, the separation of the bankruptcy business from the Chancellor's jurisdiction. The questions arising in bankruptcy were so nice, and of so much importance, that they required that the attention of the first judge in the country should be directed to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00262"><member>Mr. M. A.

As to the observations of the right hon. Secretary, he had been assured by lord Eldon himself that that learn

<p id="S2V0018P0-00264">On the order of the day for bringing up the Report of the Committee of Supply,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00265"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> expressed his determination to oppose the motion. He thought that the House ought not to have been called upon to vote any money, until ministers had made a general statement of the scale at which the whole of the establishments of the country were to be maintained, He would not be deterred from condemning what he conceived to be the profligate waste of the public money, because the hon. Secretary for the Admiralty had stated last night, that the same course had been pursued for nineteen years. Ministers required thirty thousand seamen for the present year, which was precisely the amount voted last year. From this he thought he had a right to infer that they did not intend to reduce the establishments at all. Yet it was only last session that a minister, who was now unfortunately unable to keep the pledge which he made, declared that our finances were in such a precarious state as to render the most rigid economy absolutely necessary. The existing state of the world was not such as to require the maintenance of a large naval force. The piracies in the West Indies and in South America, which had been urged as a plea for increasing our navy, had been completely put down. The Turkish fleet, too, had been destroyed. On what pretext, then, was the present establishment required? After repeating the observations which he made in the committee last night, the hon. member concluded by moving, that the report be brought up on this day week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00266"><member>Mr. Croker</member><membercontribution> observed, that the statement with which the hon. member commenced his speech might be taken as a tolerably fair specimen of the correctness of the statements with which he was in the habit of indulging the House. Referring to something which had passed in the committee last night, the hon. member had said that he would not be deterred from criticising the scale of public expense and the waste of public money, because he (Mr. Croker) had told him, that the same course had been pursued for nineteen years. That was the statement which the hon.
<col>340</col>
member had not hesitated to make in his place in that House. Honourable members who were present in the committee last night would know what credit to give to the assertion of the hon. member; but such members as were not present on that occasion would be surprised to hear what the fact really was. He certainly did, last night quote nineteen years' experience upon a particular point&#x2014;not with respect to expense, or to the extent of establishments, but merely as to the form in which a notice was entered on the Notice-book. Whether the notice referred to five thousand men or one hundred and forty thousand men; to 100,000<i>l.</i>.or 1,000,000><i>l.</i>, was not the question at the moment. The hon. member took up the Notice-book, and stated that the notice was not in the usual form. Re (Mr. Croker) then stated, that the notice had stood in the same form for the last nineteen years. He would now leave the matter with the House, as a specimen of the credit which was to be attached to the statements of the hon. member. The hon. member expressed his apprehensions, that ministers were desirous of' maintaining the establishments on the present scale, <i>>coute qui coute.</i>> Now, the very fact that the vote passed last night was for only six months, instead of for a year as usual, was an admission, on the part of ministers, that the amount of the establishments was to be kept open for the decision of the finance committee, and finally of the House. He must, however, be allowed to state, that the present amount of our naval establishment was not too large for the demands of our commerce. No less than twenty thousand seamen were at that moment employed on the foreign stations, in protecting our trade. He believed that England never had a smaller disposable idle force at home than at that moment. Out of the thirty thousand seamen, the whole of our force, not less than twenty-seven thousand were actually at sea. It might be objected, that too many guard ships were kept up; there were three at each port. It had always been the practice of England to maintain these ships, and he thought the practice was wise. It was those guard-ships that had enabled us to make an effectual effort in Europe last December, when our troops were embarked, and on their way to Portugal within twenty-four hours after the public were aware that the expedition had been determined on. The
<image src="S2V0018P0I0178"/>
<col>341</col>
hon. member for Aberdeen might, perhaps, be in possession of some new lights as to the mode in which our navy ought to be managed; but the navy of England had always been conducted on the present system in time of peace; and in his opinion it was the wisest and the best.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00267"><member>Mr. Bernal</member><membercontribution> was of opinion that some expressions which had fallen from the right hon. member for Liverpool last night required explanation. The right hon. gentleman had distinctly stated, that the projected finance committee had nothing to do with the amount of the civil and military establishments; that it was not within the scope of any finance-committee, to touch upon those delicate topics. If this was the case, what was the committee to do? and what was the House to do with its report when made? What was the meaning of taking the vote of seamen for six months only, if it was not in anticipation of some effect to be produced by the report of the committee? If, however, that committee was to be restricted in its operations&#x2014;if it was only to report that our finances were in a delicate situation, he would call it a splendid humbug on the country. For his own part, he could not see any thing unconstitutional in the committee determining the amount of our military as well as our civil establishments. If it had not that object, what was the use of postponing the other grants until it was formed? Unless some redaction was contemplated, he could not see why the amount of all the grants for the service of the year should not be stated at once. It would not do to approach our financial difficulties gently. They ought to be treated in a bold manner. The wound should be probed to the bottom. No temporary applications would be sufficient. If the intended finance committee was not appointed for such object, he cared not a straw for its appointment. He hoped the right hon. gentleman opposite would give the House some explanation on this point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00268"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that after the appeal which had been made to him, he could not remain silent. He would admit that the estimates, as laid before the House, were those which had been prepared by lord Godcrich's administration. It was asked, whether he was prepared to pledge himself to those resolutions? He would answer, that they were, he believed, made up with reference to the present wants of the
<col>342</col>
country, and that every reduction had been made consistently with those wants. More than that he would not say. With respect to the finance committee, he trusted that as only three days would elapse before it would be appointed, he should be excused for deferring any explanation respecting it till then.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00269"><member>Mr. Hudson Gurney</member><membercontribution> said, that he had pretty much the same expectation as to any great good being to be done by the finance committee as had been expressed by the hon. member for Rochester; but he thought the hon. member for Aberdeen could not possibly bring forward any plan of economy less likely to be popular, than any thing materially crippling the British navy; particularly, as he was informed, by a very high naval authority, that the ships were now sent to sea so extremely under-manned, that in case of any sudden collision some very awkward accidents might be expected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00270"><member>Mr. Monck</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. Secretary to the Admiralty had not given a satisfactory answer to the statements of his hon. friend. It did appear, that since 1817, our naval force had been increased from nineteen thousand to thirty thousand men. A thousand men had been for the purpose of suppressing the piracies in the West Indies; then came other additions, in consequence of the Burmese war, the protection of our commerce in South America, and the affairs of the Mediterranean. Now, if all these causes were in operation together, he could easily understand the necessity for keeping up our naval force to its proposed amount; but as most of those causes had ceased to exist, why should the larger force be continued? There were two things to be considered with respect to our naval force: first, what was the amount, necessary to be kept up; and next, what were the resources of the country to bear the expense? As to the first, he could not see why the same necessity for protecting her commerce would not apply to America. She had a commerce to protect as well as England, and yet her naval force bore no proportion to that which we kept up. Then, as to the means for keeping this force up, he thought, the country could not afford it; and he had no doubt, that if such extravagant establishments were maintained, it would lead, at no very distant period, to some dreadful explosion, in which the credit of the country must suffer. Under all the circumstances of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0179"/>
<col>343</col>
the case, he thought there ought to be a delay of a few days, until all the accounts were before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00271"><member>Sir Byam Martin</member><membercontribution> said, that great public inconvenience would follow if any delay took place in bringing up the report, as the funds were required for the public service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00272"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, that was no reason why the House should not do its duty. Why had not parliament been summoned to meet in November, if there was a necessity for having these votes so soon? As to the vote before the House, I he would not concur in it, until a statement of the whole services of the year were laid before them. The only effectual control which the House had over the administration of the country was to withhold the supplies, and he would do so; until the accounts he had mentioned were supplied. He would not consent to the vote on the credit of ministers, or in anticipation of what might be done by the finance committee; for in the labours of that committee he professed he had no confidence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00273"><member>Mr. G. Robinson</member><membercontribution> said, he expected much benefit to the country from the labours of the finance committee, but he hoped that they would not be restricted from inquiring into the extent of our civil establishments. With respect to the present ministry, he highly approved of the members who composed it, and he should be glad if their measures were such as he could support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00274"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> said, the hon. member was mistaken in supposing that such an opinion had fallen from his right hon. friend, as that the finance committee would be restricted from inquiring into the civil establishments of the country. In the course of their labours, they would be allowed as much scope as any other finance committee that had ever been appointed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00275"><member>Mr. K. Douglas</member><membercontribution> said, it was impossible to refuse the present vote, without greatly injuring the public service. The increase in our naval force was necessary for the due protection of our commerce in every part of the world. If England did not maintain her superiority at sea, she could not maintain her proper rank amongst nations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00276"><member>Mr. C. P. Thompson</member><membercontribution> said, that the representation made of the words which had fallen from the right hon. Secretary for
<col>344</col>
the Colonies was correct. Those words were, that the finance committee "would not examine as to the extent of our establishments." Those were the exact words, and he had heard them with surprise and regret. He said, "with regret" as he thought that the finance committee would be productive of much good. The ministers, he had no doubt, did not wish to keep up large military establishments,; but they were in a great measure controlled by the aristocracy&#x2014;by those who returned a majority of the members of that House, and who urged them to many measures to which they would otherwise be opposed. Now, having heard the words he had mentioned, he owned he was much surprised at the explanation given by the right hon. the Home Secretary, that his right hon. friend had not meant the civil establishments, the words used were "establishments;" and he begged to ask, whether it did not mean all establishments? This finance committee had been already productive of much misunderstanding. It had been the destruction of one ministry, and he hoped it would not be the means of breaking up another; as it was better to have any one fixed, than to be, as the country had been for some time past, almost without any government. It seemed very strange that it should have occasioned so great a misunderstanding as to its objects as existed between two ministers of the Crown in that House. One of those ministers came down to the House on Monday, and stated one thing, and another came down on the Tuesday and made a statement quite different.<lb/>
He trusted that the version which the right hon. gentleman had put upon what his right hon. colleague had said, was the true version. He trusted that the finance committee would be constituted so as to enter on the extent of the establishments of the country, and on the best means of giving it relief; and that we should have a real and not a delusory advantage arising out of its inquiries. He certainly had no intention to draw the right hon. gentleman into any dilemma which might hinder the establishment of the committee on the best possible plan; and therefore he trusted that the right hon. gentleman would not consider any thing which he had just said as an impediment to the mode in which it was intended to construct it. For the same reason, though he should prefer a vote of credit being taken upon the grant
<image src="S2V0018P0I0180"/>
<col>345</col>
which was then before the House, he would not, if the point to which he had alluded was clearly explained, offer any opposition to it. He must, however, be permitted to say a few words, in reply to the observations which the hon. Secretary had ventured to make upon the speech of the hon. member for Montrose. Nothing could be more hypocritical than those observations. The hon. Secretary began by stating, that the vote was only taken for six months, for the House would have an opportunity of discussing it again, when the number of seamen for the year came to be settled; and then the hon. member concluded by stating, that the present number of men was absolutely necessary for the service; thus leaving the House and the country without any hopes of having any reduction effected in this branch of the public expenditure. Now he thought that a great reduction could be effected in this department, and that it was imperiously called for by the exigencies of the country; for it was not now a question of what establishments we could wish to have, but of what establishments we could afford to keep. If we could not afford to pay for expensive establishments, we ought not to keep them. But the argument of the hon. Secretary deserved further notice. He appealed to the experience of the commercial men who had seats in the House, and said, that there were calls made upon the Admiralty by our merchants to give protection to our commerce in all parts of the world. It might be so; but if it was so, there must be something radically wrong in our present system. He knew how vulgar it was deemed in that House to quote the example of a republican government like the United States as a model for the imitation of a monarchical government like that of Great Britain; but he would not be deterred by that consideration, from placing before the House statements pregnant with instruction. It was notorious that American commerce was better protected from insult and aggression by a navy of twenty-eight ships, which was less than an eighth part of our own navy, than the commerce of England was protected by all the floating castles which we maintained, at an immense expense, in different parts of the ocean. It was a very rare circumstance to hear that American commerce had suffered any injury, from the interference of any foreign power. Let the
<col>346</col>
House look at the manner in which the American navy had treated the new states of South America; and at the manner in which it had exerted itself to put down piracy in the Mediterranean. Wherever an act of outrage had been committed upon an American vessel, summary vengeance had been taken upon the perpetrators of it; who had been compelled to make the utmost reparation for it, to those whom they had oppressed and injured. If, therefore, the calls for protection made by our merchants were so urgent upon the Admiralty, and if, with our large navy, we had not ships enough to protect our commerce, there must be, something faulty in the direction of our naval resources, and our complaints ought to be attributed to that source.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00277"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> observed, that he would leave the House to judge whether the hon. gentleman had any right to infer from any thing that he had said that night, that any difference of opinion existed between himself and the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies on the subject of the finance committee. All he had done that night was to deny that his right hon. colleague had asserted that the finance committee had nothing to do with the extent of our civil establishments. Having said thus much, he trusted he should not be considered as acting disrespectfully to the House, when he declared his intention of postponing till Friday next, any explanation respecting the finance committee. Thus much he would state now, that no limitation would be imposed upon its powers which had not been imposed on the finance committees which were appointed in 1786, 1797, and 1817.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00278"><member>Mr. Maberly</member><membercontribution> said, he recollected extremely well, that the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies had stated distinctly that the finance committee was to have nothing to do with the extent of our naval and military establishments, but that it was to confine itself entirely to an inquiry into the amount and appropriation of the money votes. He was satisfied with the explanation which the right hon. Secretary had just given the House. If the committee of finance were to have the same powers which had been conferred upon former committees, he should be satisfied. One thing was of importance&#x2014;the names which the right hon. gentleman would submit to the House on Friday night. He should judge
<image src="S2V0018P0I0181"/>
<col>347</col>
of the committee by the names. He hoped the right hon. gentleman would put those members upon the committee, who, on whatever side of the House they might sit, had most attended to the financial concerns of the country. If the committee was fairly chosen, and did its duty, it would strengthen the government and satisfy the country. As the right hon. Secretary had broken silence that might, he hoped his hon. friend would Withdraw all opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00279"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> could not agree with the hon. member, that the House or the country would be satisfied with the pledge which the names of the committee afforded. He should look to the powers proposed to be given to the committee not to the names of its members.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00280"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> said, that as they had been told that the committee was to have the same powers as were intrusted to former committees of finance, he would refer the House to the resolution tinder which the finance committee of 1817 had sat. Reference had been made to the finance committees appointed in 1786 and in 1797. Now he would accept with pleasure the pledge of the right hon. Secretary if he were allowed to refer to the powers granted to the finance committee in 1817, but not if he were called upon to adhere to those granted to the two earlier committees. For he found, by the journals, that very different powers had been given in the two cases. The resolution which appointed the earlier committees excluded from their inquiries all subjects of first-rate importance: whilst the resolution which appointed the finance committee of 1817 embraced every object to which inquiry should be directed. He thanked the right hon. Secretary for the explanation which he had just given, and contended that his hon. friend near him had gained by it the full object for which they had been arguing. He thought the present discussion had not been most properly brought on; for not an hour ought to have been lost in warning the country, if it had really been stated from authority, that the finance committee was not to have: the right to inquire into the extent of I our establishments, civil and military. That committee must be fairly appointed ' and honestly conducted, and must proceed right onwards in its duty, to merit the confidence of the country. If it did
<col>348</col>
not so proceed, it would be the greatest of all possible delusions&#x2014;a mere fence to enable the government to ride over the present session, and to gain a vote the confidence for the support of our present overgrown establishments.<lb/>
The report was then brought up On the question that it be read,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00281"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> declared his intention to oppose this vote in every stage, until some pledge was given that the expenditure should be examined into, and should be reduced as much as possible. He Compared the opposition, which some hon. gentlemen on the Treasury bench made to him, to the charges which the wolf brought against the lamb, describing himself as the lamb, which the wolf, at all events, was determined to make out to be guilty; for they first accused him of overstating the expenditure, and when beaten on that point, they declared in general terms, that he knew nothing about the matter he was talking of. The hon. member then went into statements which shewed that for many years the force of the navy had been near twenty thousand men, and that, at the present moment, it was thirty thousand men, including the royal marines. The American Fleet, destined to protect their commerce, amounted to twenty-eight ships, while ours amounted to one hundred and forty sail. He recommended that we should follow the example of the Americans, who were preparing for war, not as we were, by continuing an enormous expenditure, but by keeping their expenses within ten millions of dollars per annum, and by paying off in peace the debt they contracted in war, which was now reduced to sixty-four millions of dollars. He repeated, that the American navy consisted but of twenty-eight ships, of which one, the Delaware, was a line of battle ship; four were forty-four gun frigates of the first class, and two of the second class; nine sloops of war of the first class, and eight of the second class and four row boats attached to the sloops. The whole cost of this navy was 670,000<i>l.</i> per annum, while ours cost us six millions and a half of pounds. He contended, that the true honour and glory of a country consisted not in the expensiveness of her armaments, or in her always being ready to go to war at a moment's warning, bat in maintaining her credit, which was only to be done by economy; and he conducted by moving, by way of amendment&#x2014;

<p id="S2V0018P0-00284"><member>Lord Clifden</member><membercontribution> presented a petition from the Catholics of two parishes in Wexford, praying for relief from the existing disabilities. The petitioners complained of the gross breach of the Treaty of Limerick; and he would say that there could not be found a treaty under which the one country gained move, or which had been more unjustly violated by the other. If ever there was a clear and explicit treaty it was that; it ever there was a treaty most shamefully violated it was that. An hon. member of the other House had given notice of motion on the subject; and it was his intention to do the same on an early occasion. In his opinion the day must soon arrive when all tests with regard to religion would be abolished; for never could any thing be more unwise. He hoped that the Dissenters would be successful in their appeal to the other House; but if they were not, then they would unite with the Catholics, and their lordships would have to sing in a very different key.</membercontribution></p>

<title>GAME LAWS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00285"><member>The Marquis of Salisbury</member><membercontribution> rose to move the second reading of the Sale-of-Game bill. He should not have thought it necessary to say another word, had he not understood that it was the intention of his noble friend to move as an amendment, that a committee might be appointed to take into consideration
<image src="S2V0018P0I0183"/>
<col>351</col>
the whole subject of the Game-laws. He therefore must call to their lordships' recollection what had passed on a former occasion, to justify the objection he felt to the appointment of a committee of inquiry. Some years ago, in another place, he had moved for the appointment of such a committee, and the result of the inquiry of that committee convinced every one, that the sale of game existed to an enormous extent; that the market was fully supplied; and that in many instances game was thrown away, because a price could not be obtained sufficient to remunerate the hazard of selling it. Under these circumstances, unless a material change had taken place in the supply of game, he thought it would be perfectly useless to go into a further inquiry. The subject of the Game-laws, taken altogether, deserved their lordships' serious attention; but he did not conceive that they would obtain from a committee any information which would enable them to proceed to a legislative measure. If they once embraced the subject of the Game-laws, their lordships must examine witnesses from all parts of the country, and the inquiry would not end this session. Their lordships knew that poaching existed to an alarming extent; that it caused bloodshed and murder; and this state of things called for some measure which, by legalising the sale of game, would diminish the crime of poaching. All their lordships had agreed to the principle of this bill, for it made part of every measure introduced for the improvement of the Game-laws. If it passed, it could not possibly have any bad results; the worst which could be anticipated from it would be, that it would remain a dead letter. He expected good from it. When the sale of game was legal, no respectable tradesman would buy of the poacher; and the poacher, no longer finding a ready market, would discontinue his trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00286"><member>Lord Wharncliffe</member><membercontribution> thought that the bill so far from advancing, would retard any improvement in the Game-laws. He was sure that a bill for the mere purpose of allowing the sale of game&#x2014;leaving the other evils of the system untouched&#x2014;was, as a first measure, the worst that could be adopted. For six years he had been endeavouring to bring about an alteration in the Game-laws, without success. Three years he had tried to effect his object in the House of Commons, and at the end
<col>352</col>
of the third year one of his bills was passed, but was rejected by their lordships. He was ready to listen to the suggestions, and to give way to the prejudices, of noble lords; but he entreated the House, not to take a step which would render a complete reform of the Game-laws more difficult. Let their lordships look to the principle of this bill. They were asked to pass a bill to make game saleable in the hands of certain individuals who had the qualification to kill it. So that in order to get rid of a monopoly which existed at present, they were to create another monopoly from a motive ten times more base&#x2014;that of turning the game into hard cash in their pockets. Thus, the great landholder might say to the small one, who had game on his land, "though the animal eats your crops, yet not having 100<i>l.</i> a year, you shall not sell that animal." A law that gave such power was unjust and intolerable. He would ask any of their lordships, supposing they were small landholders, whether they would rest satisfied under such a law? No. Humanity would incite them to kill the game, and sell it in spite of his noble friend's bill. If he were convinced, that the proposed measure would be a step to other alterations, making the game belong to the person resident on the land, he should not object to it. He was, however, satisfied that it would have a contrary effect. Who were the parties who felt the warmest on the question of the Game-laws? The great landowners. There was much difficulty in persuading them that all was not quite right about those laws. There was, however, a considerable class of landholders who would have no objection to the Game-laws being amended so as to suit them, and would be exceedingly anxious to get the privilege of selling game, for the purpose of paying the expense of keeping it. Under these circumstances, what were the reasons for supposing that the extensive and dreadful practice of poaching would be put an end to by a mere bill for the sale of game? He was doubtful whether it would introduce more game into the market for the consumption of individuals than was at present consumed. Those who now preserved game killed as much of it as was consistent with keeping up the breed; and none of what they killed was thrown away. They made presents of it, or consumed it themselves; at any rate, it was all consumed. But if
<image src="S2V0018P0I0184"/>
<col>353</col>
allowing game to be sold would not increase the quantity, it would increase the demand for it. Do away the penalties on selling game, and many persons more than at present would be ready to buy it. This additional demand would, in fact, be an additional temptation to those poachers who would find means to get through the clauses of his noble friend's bill, and poaching would be more extensive than ever. It was likely, he also thought, to make the now onerous and oppressive Game-laws less agreeable to the small freeholders and land-owners. The principal reasons why they now put up with them were, that those laws were a remnant of feudal times, and were a part of the amusements of their superiors. It they were not allowed to kill game, yet the great landowner was not allowed to sell it; he gave it away&#x2014;he distributed it among his tenants or friends, or consumed it in hospitable entertainments to his neighbours. Now, he was to be allowed to sell that game which had been fed on their crops; the land-owner was to be allowed to turn the game into money, and thus the only reasons which reconciled the smaller freeholders to the Game-laws would be done away. He felt strongly on the subject, and he disliked very much that any measures should pass their lordships, which had the appearance of legislating for their own advantage, and not for the general benefit.&#x2014;He wished to say a few words on the state of society occasioned by the Game-laws. He would only refer, however, to what happened in the north of England during the last Summer assizes. There were, he believed, several cases of game-keepers who were convicted of murder. He had a great respect for the learned judge who presided; but he could not believe, on his dictum, that it was the law of the land, that a game-keeper was not allowed to carry a gun; that nobody but the actually qualified person was allowed to carry a gun. He did not think this was good law, though it was so laid down by the judge. But this did not alter the nature of the Game-laws, which caused evils peculiarly their own. The evils and crimes caused by those laws could not be suppressed, except by a complete alteration of the laws. In Yorkshire, the poachers met in large bodies, and settled among themselves what part of the county they should overrun. He would lay a particular case of this description
<col>354</col>
before their lordships, which shewed what crimes the Game-laws gave occasion to, and which no gamekeepers could prevent; for they could not resist without endangering their lives:&#x2014;On December 31st, last year, a party, consisting of forty poachers, assembled near Pontefract, and resolved to kill the game of a gentleman in that neighbourhood; they proceeded to their work, the gamekeepers being quite unable to resist them, and there being no force in the neighbourhood to render assistance. After killing all the game they could find on this spot they proceeded along the high road, in open day, to sir John Ramsden's, who had fifteen keepers and guards. On the keepers approaching, they heard a voice command the poachers to leave off firing, to draw their shot, and load with bullets. Sir John Ramsden's people retired, and left the poachers to kill us much game as they could. He would also refer to the case of sir G. Armitage's keeper, whom the poachers shot at and killed; but, the very night after, the spot was again frequented; which shewed that no terror, no ordinary motives, could operate to restrain these people. He thought the evil very deep seated, and that it was their lordships business to probe it to the bottom. He did not wish to adhere to the plan he had brought forward last year; but he wished their lordships to take the matter fully into their consideration; and if they did that, he did not doubt but they would fall upon some measure which would satisfy the House. He should not think it necessary, if a committee were appointed, to examine much evidence on the subject; but he should propose to verify on oath a few of those facts which had recently thrown so much light on the working of the Game-laws. He only wished that those most interested in the question might meet, not as in that House, but in a private room, where they might talk over the measure; and he had no doubt they would come to a conclusion which would be satisfactory to all parties. He could assure his noble friend, that he would find there were certain persons in the other House who wished for no alteration in these laws, and who were always strong enough, by uniting with one party or the other, to defeat every improvement. He thought the measure of his noble friend would enable these persons to defeat all improvement in the whole code of Game-laws; and there-

<col>355</col>
fore, he would move, "that the bill be read a second time this day six months."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00287"><member>The Earl of Falmouth</member><membercontribution> said, he had opposed the bill brought in by the noble baron last session, because that bill had for its object not merely the prevention and diminution of crime by making game saleable, but the further object of giving new rights to every owner of a field or garden&#x2014;rights which he had never purchased or inherited, and prejudicial to their habits of industry and usual occupations. With respect to a Committee of Inquiry, he thought no good could result from such a course as the subject had been repeatedly discussed by parliament. As to the present bill, he saw no reason to change his opinion since last session. He could not think that the making of game saleable would prevent or diminish crime. To him it appeared, that the opening of a market for game held out more temptation to poachers, and made detection more difficult. But, as it was believed by many persons, that the making game saleable would prevent or materially diminish the crime of poaching, the present bill, perhaps, would be the safest way to put that argument to the test of experiment. He should not, therefore, oppose the second reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00288"><member>The Duke of Richmond</member><membercontribution> perfectly agreed with lord Wharncliffe as to the expediency of a complete alteration in the Game-laws. Game was not preserved by law, but by armed force. On this subject, he was a great reformer. He would repeal the whole of those laws, and substitute a summary act in their stead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00289"><member>The Earl of Carnarvon</member><membercontribution> thought if a Committee of Inquiry was appointed, its first measure would be, to put an end to the prohibition of the sale of game. He had never heard any alteration in the Game-laws proposed, which did not contain the principle of the sale of game. The only objection to the present bill was, that though it gave the right to sell game, it did not give it so extensively as the noble lord near him wished. But that noble lord was wrong in stating, that the bill would only give that right to great land-owners. It went much-further. It gave the right of selling game to any man possessing land to the amount of 100<i>l.</i> a-year, and perhaps there were a hundred thousand who possessed that right. Besides, a clause might be added, by which the qualifications might be extended to occupiers of land, under certain circum-
<col>356</col>
stances. If their lordships began by legalizing the sale of game, it would be easy to extend the qualifications afterwards, and then that would have its operation immediately on the bill before them; for that bill gave the right of selling game to all who possessed the right of killing it. From the present state of things, it was impossible for their lordships to legislate on a great and extensive scale. He agreed in the observation that, if any influential member of the other House would get rid of his prejudices so as to bring that House to re-consider the whole of their standing orders, he would confer the greatest benefit on his country. It was unjust towards their lordships, that they should be precluded from making penal acts; since, by the constitution of that House, their lordships were better able than the other House to frame a bill connected with jurisprudence, from their having the capacity of a court of justice, and having so many law lords among them. The great object of our ancestors in framing those rules, arose from a jealousy of grants to the Crown; and it would be a great advantage if the other House, still keeping the grants of money to itself, would give up nominal privileges. A clause, regulating a toll, made a bill a money bill; and after individuals had been put to great expense in bringing up a private bill, their lordships had only the option to put an end to it by making an amendment, or to permit the bill to pass, though it might contain positive injustice. As things stood, any attempt to introduce a bill on a large and extensive scale would, from the nature of things, be fruitless. He regretted exceedingly, the depredations committed all over the country in the pursuit of game, and was not sanguine enough to believe that any alteration that their lordships could make in the Game-laws would produce a material improvement. It appeared to be the fashion to impute every crime committed under the Game-laws to the operation of the laws themselves; but the present state of the Poor-laws and of the labouring classes throughout the south of England&#x2014;rendered it absolutely impossible that the extent of those crimes could be diminished by any revision of the Penal-laws. He could state, from what had happened within his neighbourhood, that, during almost the whole of last winter, there was scarcely any employment for the unmarried men. It usually happened,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0186"/>
<col>357</col>
that when the single men were without employment, they applied to the overseers of the parish for relief; who sent them by scores to work upon the roads, and the uniform result was, that they were sent to work upon bread-money wages&#x2014;that was to say, upon just as much as the justices of the peace deemed to be sufficient for the minimum of existence. These men were sometimes sent to pick stones, and were allowed 4<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> per day, whilst others were allowed 1<i>s.</i> per day, because they were married men. He had sometimes found, that the young men were sent to pick stones in fields where no stones were to be found, in order that their time might be consumed for a trifling remuneration; and this happened in a country full of great roads near the capital, and in a highly cultivated agricultural district. This want of employment among the labouring poor was the grand cause of poaching. He was so satisfied of this, that he had endeavoured to put an end to poaching by employing the people through the winter, and with such success that there was hardly a poacher to be found in his parish. He sent them to work together in small companies; and he found that they worked with great emulation, although they were very dissatisfied when working singly. He had pursued this course for four years; and although he had not so many pheasants on his estates as some noble lords, yet he had a good many, and he found that none of those persons destroyed any game, but that they were growing up an industrious set of men, whilst the young people of the neighbouring parishes were not only idle and engaged in poaching, but were sent in considerable numbers to the tread-mill every winter. He was satisfied that such was the state of a great part of the country; and that the first step to be taken to remedy it was, to open the sale of game, to take away that strange principle, that whatever might be a man's character or influence, or personal property, if he had not a friend who could send him game, there was no other course by which he could obtain it than by openly encouraging robbery. He was satisfied, if their lordships should pass the bill, that the most beneficial consequences would result from it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00290"><member>Lord Teynham</member><membercontribution> said, he should vote with great pleasure for the second reading of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00291"><member>The Marquis of Londonderry</member><membercontribution> was of
<col>358</col>
opinion, that any general inquiry and any general measure for the improvement or alteration of the Game-laws, ought to be commenced in the other branch of the legislature. As he had always opposed the bill for the sale of game, he could not vote for it now; but in dividing against it, he did not mean to pledge himself to support a proposal for a committee. He was anxious to repress the prevailing rage for legislation upon every trifling matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00292"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> said, he had declared, many years ago, his opinion in favour of a bill upon the principle of that now offered for a second reading, on the ground, that the law, as it stood, was perpetually violated. He therefore should support the motion without deciding whether the measure might not need modification in the committee. After all that had been so ably stated&#x2014;he was satisfied that justice could not be done without a thorough investigation. That the Game-laws were absurd and anomalous, and ought to be revised, no man would deny. In reference to the state of the peasantry of England, and to the operation which a repeal of the Game-laws might have in producing non-residence, he wished to call the attention of their lordships to the almost hopeless condition of the people of Ireland. Whoever had looked into the subject must know, that the increased facility of communication between the two countries, and the deplorable want of employment in Ireland, had induced a number of Irish labourers to visit this country, and the evil was every year augmented.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00293"><member>The Marquis of Salisbury</member><membercontribution> said, it was the object of his bill to put down the warfare that was going on in the country between the poachers and gamekeepers, who were as regularly opposed to each other as any two factions in times of civil war. This state of things was, no doubt, partly owing to the total want of employment among the lower orders. It was his intention to propose a bill which would give the overseers of parishes who might choose to adopt the plan which he should have to propose, the means of affording employment to the poor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00294"><member>Lord Clifden</member><membercontribution> said, he should be glad to support the proposition of the noble lord, if he thought it would prevent the civil war which was going on between the poachers and gamekeepers.

<title>TEST AND CORPORATION ACTS&#x2014;PETITION OF ROMAN CATHOLICS FOR REPEAL OF.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00296"><member>Mr. J. Smith</member><membercontribution> said, he held in his hand a petition, to which he must beg to call the attention of the House. It was from the Catholic body in Ireland, in favour of the claims of the Protestant Dissenters of England. He was authorized to assure the House, that the individuals who had signed this petition, being three thousand in number, comprised within themselves nearly all the wealth, character, and respectability of Ireland. He confessed that, though he was aware of the liberal spirit which pervaded the Catholics of Ireland, he could not help feeling a little surprised at the truly generous manner in which they expressed themselves in this petition. The hon. member, after reading several parts of the petition, insisted upon the right of every man to worship God in whatever way he pleased. That sentiment was well expressed in the petition; it had been gaining ground every day; he was glad of it, and he regretted that its progress had been so slow, for the denial of it had caused torrents of blood and tears to flow. He had had occasion to state in that House, on presenting a petition to the same effect as this, that the Dissenters petitioned for themselves; that they were totally independent of the Catholics. The Dissenters presented their own case, in their own name. The present petition, he was also bound to say, did not originate in any league between the Catholics and the Protestant Dissenters it proceeded from the Catholics alone. It was the spontaneous assistance of the Catholics to the cause of the Protestant Dissenters, in whose disabilities they sympathized.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00297"><member>Mr. A. Dawson</member><membercontribution> said, the petition plainly showed, that whatever prejudices the Catholic church might once have entertained, they were now very rapidly abating, or rather they were totally extinct. The petitioners said, they rejoiced that the Pro-
<col>360</col>
testant Dissenters in Ireland enjoyed that civil and religious liberty which was denied to them in England. The Puritans of Ireland had, at one time, regarded the Catholics with jealousy and distrust; but ever since they had received these privileges, from the wisdom of the Irish parliament, fifty years ago, all jealousy and distrust had been put an end to. He thought the petition ought to circulate throughout the land, that it might tend to liberalize the whole Christain community. This would be a happy country, if it were a more liberal one. To grant the claims of the Dissenters could not endanger the established church in England; since it had not done any injury to the established church in Ireland. If all these disabilities were removed, the government would be saved a vast deal of trouble. They occasioned schisms in families; and, not only in families, but in the government itself. They would not have to run about in search of a chancellor of the Exchequer; nor to seek for a first lord of the Treasury in the army, if these distinctions were done away with.</membercontribution></p>

<title>VOTE OF THANKS TO SIR E. CODRINGTON&#x2014;BATTLE OF NAVARIN.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00299"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> rose, and addressed the House as follows:&#x2014;<lb/>
In presuming, Sir, to offer myself to the House upon this occasion, I am fully aware that I have need of all, and much more than all, the usual indulgence bestowed upon its members&#x2014;that usual indulgence which, I feel proud to say, while with gratitude I avow it, has been often and freely bestowed upon me. I say I have need of all its indulgence; for, however often the same vote which I now mean to propose has passed this House&#x2014;however often the representatives of the country have been called upon to express their gratitude and the gratitude of the nation for services performed, and for victories achieved, by their gallant countrymen in arms, by land or by sea&#x2014;never, except on one occasion, when the late Mr. Sheridan moved the Thanks of this House to the English Volunteers&#x2014;an occasion which, as far as respects the highly-distinguished individual who moved those thanks, can form no precedent or apology for any ordinary man to undertake the same task&#x2014;never, I repeat, has the proposition for such a Vote of Thanks, on such
<image src="S2V0018P0I0188"/>
<col>361</col>
an occasion, been submitted to the approbation of this House, unless by a member belonging to his majesty's councils. At the same time, I cannot help thinking, and the idea has often occurred to me when deliberating upon these matters on other occasions, and long before I had reason to apply my mind to the case now before the House, that it would be a preferable arrangement, and one calculated to throw a greater degree of lustre upon the event, if a Vote of Thanks for meritorious services were occasionally seen to emanate from some member of the House not immediately connected with the government. If a vote of this description has any value at all, it is because we suppose it to be the unbiassed and unaffected expression of national gratitude; and though it is true, that propositions of this nature have ever found a responsive feeling in the bosom of every man, yet it seems equally clear that a minister of the Crown, when bringing such matters under the consideration of the House, necessarily stands upon an eminence of power and of influence which no member opposed to the government can hope to command, and from which, he must, in some degree, be able to sway the opinions and direct the judgment, of parliament. Let me also add that, if this duty is never to devolve upon any but a person connected with the government, it appears plain, that those who may be called upon by a sense of their constitutional duty to oppose that government, are condemned to all that is irksome and painful in that duty&#x2014;the necessity of constantly finding fault; while they are wholly deprived of the more pleasing task of offering their homage to merit, or returning the thanks of a grateful country to those who labour in its service. I cannot help thinking still further, that even for the sake of those whose services may place them in a condition to receive those thanks, it would be highly desirable that the usage in these cases should be occasionally departed from. For is it not obvious, that under the present practice, those who may be called upon to command our fleets, or our armies, must be in a great measure dependent upon accidental circumstances, and private or political views, for much of their final renown, rather than upon any of those chances and dangers to which they are subjected by their profession? If the fame and the fortunes of those who fight our battles on the ocean, or in the
<col>362</col>
field, are to be subject to all the intrigues of parties, and the wiles of cabinets, it is impossible to say whether the hero of the one day may not become the adventurer of the next, and whether the parliament which, under the influence of one minister, might be prepared to praise, may not, when controlled by his successor, be ready for reproof, perhaps, for punishment. To such a dependence upon accidents, an officer devoting his life and labours to his country should not be subject. He should, on the contrary, be safe from all political storms, and from all the vicissitudes which, chequer the lives of statesmen. He should feel sure that no change of administration could affect his character, and that having once deserved the thanks of his country, those thanks would be inevitably conferred. It is clear that, so long as proposals such as I am about to make, proceed invariably from ministers, the commanders of our fleets and armies can feel no such security. They must, to a certain degree, be involved in the fate of those political servants of the Crown who called for their services. Their honour may be the plaything, perhaps the victim, of a courtier. Nothing can be more unfair&#x2014;nothing more unjust&#x2014;nothing more detrimental&#x2014;to the public service. A practice involving such consequences should be abandoned; and it appears to me that the late achievement at Navarin, affords an opportunity which should not be suffered to pass by unimproved [hear, hear&#x0021;].<lb/>
When, Sir, I make use of these reflections, I beg it to be understood that I disclaim any intention of introducing party politics on this occasion. I think that such an attempt would be as inappropriate to the subject as it would be unfair to the character and fortune of that gallant admiral and his brave companions, whose services I am anxious to reward. I must suppose, in speaking upon this subject, that it is the intention of his majesty's government not to leave that gallant officer and his companions without the usual reward; and I therefore think it right to say further, that I wish wholly to separate the merit of their achievements from the propriety of the policy which sent them to the scene of their triumph. It is my decided intention not to use a single phrase which can provoke political discussion, or even to drop a single expression which may be construed, into an attempt to in-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0189"/>
<col>363</col>
troduce party dissentions; and in the examinations and inquiries I have felt it necessary to make as to precedents, I am happy to say I have found that line always adopted when there was a chance of any difference as to the policy which sent our victorious armies into the field of action.<lb/>
On a late occasion, when this subject, was mentioned, I took the liberty of observing to the noble lord opposite (lord Palmerston), that there was a precedent which tallied, in my opinion, with the case now under consideration. Since that evening, I have discovered that the precedent of the Copenhagen expedition applies even more closely than I supposed, and particularly as to the distinction drawn between the policy which sent out the force, and the action for which the commander and his followers entitled themselves to the gratitude of their country. I find that lord Liverpool, in proposing a vote of thanks to those who served at Copenhagen, expresses himself thus&#x2014;" Were that expedition as unjust and unnecessary as he thought it just and necessary, or as impolitic and unwise as he thought it politic and wise, still he would contend, that that would be no ground of opposition to a Vote of Thanks to those who had so ably and skilfully executed the services which that expedition required." These were the sentiments of lord Liverpool upon a case almost precisely in point, and to them I now earnestly request the attention of the House. Besides the opinion of lord Liverpool in favour of the Vote of Thanks for the expedition to Copenhagen, Mr. Perceval strongly supported that vote, and supported it on the ground of the manner of its execution by the army and navy, apart from the policy of the measure. His language on that occasion was, "he hoped the House would not refuse their thanks to the officers engaged in this expedition, because they had executed a painful and heart-rending duty." Such was the language of Mr. Perceval; and to the same effect also was the language of lord Castlereagh. In introducing the Vote of Thanks to the army and navy for the expedition at Copenhagen, that noble lord made use of this language:&#x2014;"Whatever difference of opinion there might be as to the political character of the expedition in this House, he flattered himself that no difference would exist on the proposition he was about to submit. It had always been the
<col>364</col>
custom to consider the services rendered by his majesty's army and navy, in carrying into effect the orders with which they were intrusted, distinctly and separately from the merits of the policy, by which his majesty's ministers were actuated in issuing those orders "[hear, hear&#x0021;]. If, then, this was admitted to be the practice of the House of Commons in former times, surely there can be no just grounds for deviating from it on the present. Lord Castlereagh went on to remark, that the Vote of Thanks "was a justice due to the army and the navy, who were never called upon to decide as to the propriety or impropriety, nor to mix their conduct with that of those by whose impulse they acted, and who alone were responsible for the prudence, justice, wisdom, and policy of the plans they directed to be carried into execution" [hear, hear&#x0021;]. It was therefore due to the army and navy to look only to the execution; which was the distinct service that fell to their charge. But it was not to the army and navy alone that this distinct consideration now was a point of justice, but also to the gentlemen of the House who might differ from his majesty's ministers as to the propriety of the plans that might be carried into effect.&#x2014;These gentlemen would naturally wish to bear testimony as warmly as any other, to the meritorious conduct of his majesty's army and navy; but they would find difficulty in so doing, with satisfaction, if the merits of the army and, navy were not submitted in a shape wholly distinct from the conduct of ministers [cheers].<lb/>
If such a course, Sir, was adopted towards the army and navy, for the skill and ability in the execution of the expedition to Copenhagen; if on that occasion all party politics were to be deprecated&#x2014;the conduct of ministers left out of sight&#x2014;how much higher grounds are there in the present instance for following a similar line of conduct towards our brave countrymen, for the skill and courage displayed by them at Navarin. Let the House bear in mind how the expedition to Copenhagen was spoken of by some of the most distinguished members of parliament at that period. Lord Sidmouth designated it" an outrage." Lord Grenville and lord Ellenborough denounced it as an "indelible disgrace to this country." Mr. Windham and doctor Laurence both termed it "a lasting monument of disgrace." Mr. Whitbread branded it as "a treacherous and base aggression"
<image src="S2V0018P0I0190"/>
<col>365</col>
on our part. Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Tierney, and other distinguished members of parliament spoke of it in corresponding language of obloquy and condemnation. Yet all this, Sir, did not prevent a Vote of Thanks from being passed in this House to the army and navy who were engaged in the execution of that expedition. In the House of Lords, no division took place on the vote. There was, indeed, an objection taken to that vote by lords Holland and Grey, the principal ground of which was, that thanks were not only voted to the army who were engaged, but also to the navy who had no opportunity of displaying their skill on that occasion. Indeed I believe that there was not a single shot fired from any of our large ships during that expedition, and that whatever naval warfare took place was confined to gun-boats and bomb-vessels. Nevertheless, this objection was overruled by lord Moira, who had signed the protest against the expedition; and who contended, "that it was not I for officers sent upon an expedition to judge of its policy; their only duty was to execute the service intrusted to them, and if they did it with skill, success, and ability, they were fairly entitled to thanks." In any of those objections which were made on that occasion, or in any of the protests which were entered into, there was no attempt made to make the troops engaged in the expedition responsible for any thing more than for the faithful performance of the duty assigned them. In the division which took place in this House, on the Vote of Thanks, and in the minority on that division, I observe the names of the present Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and my hon. colleague. Their opposition rested on the fact of there being no naval action to justify a Vote of Thanks to the navy, This consideration, together with the overwhelming superiority of our force; the imbecile resistance made to it, and the whole exploit, in which, after four days' fighting there were not more than three hundred killed and wounded, did not, in the estimation of those who opposed that vote, constitute an achievement of that character which entitled troops engaged in it to the express approbation of parliament. But the ministry of that day took care to set their seal upon the victory. When the news first arrived, the Park and Tower guns were fired. Lord Gambier, who commanded the naval forces, was made a peer. The strongest possible congratula-
<col>366</col>
tion on the event was inserted in the king's Speech, and re-echoed by the addresses in both Houses. Finally, thanks were voted to the officers without a moment's delay; and so persevering was the government to justify the whole exploit and to support their officers in every department, that the very Ordnance and Transport Boards were included in the general commendation.<lb/>
How different, Sir, has been the fate of those who have now performed this great deed of arms&#x0021; I find no congratulation in the Royal Speech on this extraordinary achievement&#x2014;Anachievement which, as far as relates to the glory of the British arms, and to the interests of civilization and humanity, is far more calculated than the expedition to Copenhagen to warrant the expression of national congratulation, and to call forth the expression of national gratitude [cheers]. It is on account of this omission of congratulatory expression in the Royal Speech, and because no member of his majesty's government has proposed a suitable acknowledgment to our brave countrymen, that I, Sir&#x2014;an independent member of parliament&#x2014;may, I trust, be excused and justified in calling forth such an acknowledgment of the sense which this House entertains of their meritorious conduct. Pursuing this line of argument as to the propriety which I feel of bringing this subject under the consideration of the House, in the omission to do so in those quarters in which the mention of it might have been expected to originate, I would remind the House, that the action of Navarin was the consequence of instructions which emanated from the lamented Mr. Canning; who, if no unfortunate accident had befallen the country in his spirit being withdrawn from the councils of the nation&#x2014;if he had not been removed between the period of issuing his instructions and the glorious execution of them&#x2014;would not have permitted the services of those, by whom those instructions were executed, to pass unacknowledged and unrewarded. That same minister was in office when the Copenhagen expedition was performed. It was planned&#x2014;at least it has always been so understood&#x2014;by Mr. Canning, who was Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the time; and if he had not continued in office from its commencement to its close, it is not improbable that the Vote of Thanks which were passed to lord Cathcart and admiral
<image src="S2V0018P0I0191"/>
<col>367</col>
Gambier would not have been carried in the manner in which it had been through both Houses of the legislature. Thus it is that, if any minister issues instructions, and remains in power until those instructions are fulfilled, then the admirals and officers employed in the public service receive the public thanks of parliament. But if, between the issuing of the instructions and the fulfilment of them, the minister is put out of power&#x2014;if he is unfortunately removed by death, then it is not, it would seem, deemed necessary or advisable, by those who succeed him, to convey the expression of the public thanks for the execution of orders emanating from their predecessors in power. This, Sir, renders it doubly incumbent on independent members of parliament to call the attention of the House to those services, respecting which&#x2014;as in the present instance&#x2014;his majesty's government may not be disposed to originate a motion expressive of the national sentiment. Whatever may have been the claims of those who were engaged in the Copenhagen expedition&#x2014;the merits of which expedition were a thousand times more doubtful than those of this battle&#x2014;their claims, it would be contended by no person, were superior to those of our navy in the late achievement at Navarin. If Mr. Canning had still been spared&#x2014;if he had remained to stand by those who conquered at Navarin, as he stood by those who were engaged in the Copenhagen expedition&#x2014;their services would not have been permitted to pass without suitable and customary acknowledgment. Whilst, indeed, his spirit, though departed, seemed to animate the king's councils, and whilst his sun had not sunk so long to rest, but that some faint reflection of his light was still seen above the horizon, justice was done to our brave countrymen by the speedy and unequivocal expression of the king's approbation of their conduct.<lb/>
Indeed, even now I am not without hope, that they who have succeeded him will carry into complete and faithful execution the provisions of the treaty of London, by which they, too, have declared themselves to be bound. As a part of that fulfilment, it is necessary to acknowledge suitably the skill and bravery of those to whom the execution of its provisions has been intrusted. And let the House consider, that the motion to which I now call for their assent, is in strict conformity with
<col>368</col>
what has already been in part done. It only requires of them to follow up the expression of approbation of the conduct of our navy which all concurrent testimonies from different quarters fully show that it eminently merits. Let us see what took place on the first news in this country of the victory at Navarin. The intelligence of the victory reached London on the 10th of November; and on the 13th a proof was given in the Gazette of the full approbation of the Admiralty and ministers of that day, of the conduct of admiral Codrington. There appeared in the Gazette the following notice:&#x2014;"The King has been pleased to nominate and appoint vice-admiral sir Edward Codrington, Knight-commander of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, to be a Knight Grand Cross of the said Most Honourable Order; and the King has been also pleased to appoint the undermentioned officers in the Royal Navy to be companions of the said Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath." This honorary distinction was extended to four captains and seven commanders. This was an unequivocal testimony of the royal approbation, and of that of the ministers then in office, of his conduct. After this cordial expression of the royal approbation of the officers which has already been given, what objection can there be now to follow it up by the thanks of this House? Is it to the instructions of ministers that objection is now taken? If it will not be contended (as I presume it will not), that the officers fulfilled their instructions faithfully, the only other opposition that can be taken is to the original instructions, from which admiral Codrington did not depart, and according to the tenor of which he strictly acted. After the expression of the royal approbation which has already been given, there is strong reason to doubt that the instructions, of which the victory was the consequence, can be called into question. If, then, the instructions were proper to be given, and if the victory was a faithful execution of them, where can he the opposition to the present motion? It is indeed to be regretted, that that approbation which our gracious sovereign expressed in the first instance was not followed by corresponding sentiments in the royal Speech at the beginning of the session. This would have been conformable to the testimonies which have poured into England from all quarters, and which it
<image src="S2V0018P0I0192"/>
<col>369</col>
might have been imagined, would more than counterbalance the forgeries and fallacies of the "Austrian Observer." Such, however, by some accident, was the authority attached to those malicious rumours, that an investigation was, we know, instituted into the circumstances of this great action. Sir John Gore was sent out to inquire into the circumstances that led to the battle. The report of that gallant officer, it is to be assumed, confirmed, in every respect, the propriety of the course adopted by admiral Codrington. That the report of sir John Gore contained such a confirmation is borne out by the answer given to me on a former night; and of which answer the present motion is the consequence. The noble Secretary at War replied to a question from me, that it was not intended to publish the report brought to this country by sir John Gore; and the noble lord gave as a reason, that "as no blame whatever attached to admiral Codrington, it was not necessary to volunteer his exculpation." This, therefore, justifies me in the position, that he is free from blame. But, besides the subsequent investigation instituted by sir John Gore, and the authority of the noble lord, of the gallant admiral's exemption from all blame, I have the additional fact, that he is still retained in the chief command of the Mediterranean. The noble duke at the head of the Administration is an excellent judge in what consists the carrying of military orders into effect; and sure I am, that if this gallant admiral exceeded his strict orders, the noble duke would not retain him in his present command [hear, hear&#x0021;]. Besides the noble duke, there is the right hon. Secretary for the Colonial Department, and other members who sit near him, who were parties to the issuing of these orders, and they can declare whether the gallant officer did more than fairly carry the orders that were given him into effect. The testimony of the noble duke is so strongly corroborative of the merit of admiral Codrington, that the House, I am sure, will grant me its indulgence, while I repeat what he stated in his place in parliament, as the head of the Administration: "I did not make the slightest charge, nor cast the most distant imputation upon the gallant officer who commanded at Navarin. Certainly not. That gallant officer, in doing as he has done, discharged what he felt to be his duty to his country. It should be recollected,
<col>370</col>
that the gallant admiral was placed in a situation of great delicacy as well as difficulty. He was placed in the command of a combined squadron in conjunction with two foreign admirals, and his conduct was such, that they placed the most implicit confidence in him, and allowed him to lead them on to victory. I should feel myself unworthy of the situation which I hold in his majesty's councils, if I thought myself capable of uttering a single syllable against that gallant admiral&#x2014;admiring as I do the intrepid bravery with which he conducted himself in a moment of much difficulty and danger" [hear, hear&#x0021;]. Such is the testimony of the first minister of the Crown&#x2014;a minister, too, it should be recollected, than whom there is no man living who better knows how far an officer may go in intrepidity with safety to his country [hear, hear&#x0021;]&#x2014;than whom no person can more appropriately measure out the due proportion of courage, or of skill, which a commander may display, without being subjected to the imputation of injurious rashness. To the testimony of the duke of Wellington, let me add that of the noble lord (Dudley), the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to whose department the consideration of this subject properly belonged. "My noble friend (Carnarvon) states," said the noble Secretary, "that the documents are necessary for the vindication of the character of the gallant admiral who commanded at the battle of Navarin, and of the officers who served under him. My answer to that is&#x2014;that it has not been attacked&#x2014;that sir Edward Codrington does not stand in need of vindication. He was engaged in a most important service, and he has received the high reward consequent upon a meritorious discharge of his duties; therefore, as far as regards his sovereign and the government, he stands in no need of vindication." In addition to the testimonies of the duke of Wellington and lord Dudley, I will add that of lord Goderich, the head of the late administration. What was his testimony as to the conduct of admiral Codrington? "The gallant admiral," said lord Goderich, "had been placed in circumstances of no ordinary difficulty&#x2014;he had performed his duty like a man. In his opinion he had exercised a sound discretion, and had ably supported his own character, as well as the honour and glory of his country." Such were the testimonies borne to the character and conduct
<image src="S2V0018P0I0193"/>
<col>371</col>
of this gallant officer, by those who had official opportunities of forming the best judgment of it. The marquis of Lansdowne&#x2014;than whom there is not a more upright or truer spoken man in the country&#x2014;united his opinion to those already cited, in approbation of sir Edward Codrington "He felt it his duty to declare, that if any blame attached any where, most assuredly it was not on the gallant officer who commanded the fleet. When all the documents connected with this transaction were known, the House would be convinced with him, that the gallant officer wisely understood, and fairly exercised his discretion under the circumstances in which he was placed."<lb/>
Relying on these testimonies&#x2014;each of them sufficient authority for my object&#x2014;each of them proceeding from a minister of the Crown, capable of forming a correct judgment on this important point&#x2014;I have ventured to come forward on this trying occasion&#x2014;unconnected with government&#x2014;acting as an independent member of parliament, without concert with any party, I might almost add, uncertain of the support of any member in the House, and throwing myself, for whatever support my motion may receive, on the just principles and generous feelings which dwell in the bosoms of an assembly of English gentlemen [cheers]. It is in the full reliance on these principle sand feelings, and in the absence of all imputation upon the gallant officer, either for rashness, for a departure from, or want of discretion, and in the presence of all concurrent and confirming testimony, which establishes the reverse of such an imputation, that I rest my motion for Congratulation and Thanks for an exploit, which is alike honourable for the arms of the country, which by it were preserved untarnished, and glorious to humanity, for the sake of whose interests it was achieved. It is a source of regret, that the authentic public documents connected with this exploit are not made public; but from such public documents&#x2014;the common and ordinary sources of intelligence&#x2014;as we do possess, there has been, without a single difference of opinion, an expression, of full and entire confidence in the skill and merits of our officer. There never was an action fought, where, if any blame could attach to the commander-in-chief, his conduct was so open to scrutiny or so liable to misinterpretation: but we have yet to learn, that
<col>372</col>
any criticism whatever has proceeded from either of the officers commanding the rival, but friendly, squadrons of Russia and of France. On the contrary, it is perhaps the most pleasing feature of this great achievement, that not a murmur of jealousy, of envy, or of discontent, was heard in the united fleets of nations that never before, in the history of the world, had been led to victory by the British flag; and one of whom has so often contended with us for the empire of the seas. What a subject for honest pride&#x2014;pride that would have wounded none, and gratified all&#x0021;&#x2014;How well might it have been a topic of congratulation in that part of his majesty's Speech, in which he told us of the friendly disposition of his allies&#x0021;&#x2014;How came so natural, so pleasing, so irresistible a tribute to our mighty co-operation in this holy work, to be altogether omitted? Surely this was a victory&#x2014;unlike other warlike successes&#x2014;which left no regrets, caused no tears, excited no jealousies, and afforded the noblest occasion for true heroism, by promoting the general interests of humanity, without the discomfiture or disgrace of any portion of the civilized community of Europe. Nevertheless, this great exploit is, in the king's Speech, alluded to only as a source of lamentation and regret; nor is there a single phrase to denote the satisfaction which must have arisen in the royal bosom at the noble emulation, the cordial obedience, with which the admirals of France and Russia supported the honour, and seconded the efforts of the British arms.<lb/>
And this it is, that constitutes one of the principal features of my case, that that notice and that commendation have not been bestowed upon the victory of Navarin, which, on former occasions, victories, certainly not of superior or equal importance, called forth. Sir, it is a very peculiar, and a very felicitous circumstance of this case, that we find high and distinguished persons of other countries, placed in a situation which rendered them excellent judges of sir Edward Codrington's conduct on this memorable occasion, concur in expressing their admiration of that conduct in terms of the most unqualified character. I am not aware whether or not it is a usage on the part of kings to write personally to private individuals; but, undoubtedly, his majesty the emperor of Russia did not consider it as derogatory from his dignity to address to our gallant
<image src="S2V0018P0I0194"/>
<col>373</col>
admiral a letter, which is so eloquent and feeling an effusion, that I am sore the House will pardon me if I now read it to them. The letter, which was written a few days after the emperor received an account of the battle, is as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"St. Petersburgh, Nov. 8.,</quote>
"Vice-Admiral Codrington&#x2014;You have, achieved a victory for which civilized Europe ought to be doubly grateful to you. The memorable battle of Navarin, and the bold man&#x0153;uvres which preceded it, evince to the world not only the extent of the zeal of three great powers in favour of a cause, the noble character of which is still more heightened by their own disinterestedness; but also prove what can be effected by firmness, though opposed to numbers; and what a well-directed valour can accomplish against blind courage, with whatever force that courage may be supported. Your name, from this time forward, belongs to posterity. By praise I should but weaken the glory which surrounds it. But I must offer to you a brilliant mark of the gratitude and esteem with which you have inspired all Russia. With this view I send to you herewith the military order of St. George. The Russian navy is proud of having obtained your commendation at Navarin; and, on my own part, I feel the most lively pleasure in thus assuring you of the sentiments of consideration which I entertain towards you.
<quote>(Signed)</quote>
<quote>"NICHOLAS."</quote>
Sir, besides this decisive and unequivocal proof of the approbation of the emperor of Russia, of admiral Codrington's conduct, a letter was written a day or two after by count de Nesselrode to count de Heiden, which goes still further; for in that letter count de Nesselrode informs count de Heiden, that his majesty the emperor of Russia has charged him to address to the prince de Lieven a despatch, "by which that ambassador is directed to declare to the government of his Britannic majesty, that in the opinion of the emperor, the measures resorted to on the part of sir E. Codrington were as just and beneficial as his conduct was admirable." In a subsequent passage of the letter, count de Nesselrode says to count de Heiden, "Should there be no ship for the moment adapted to the command of sir E. Codrington, and he consent to hoist his flag on board a ship of the line belonging to his imperial majesty, you will
<col>374</col>
place at his disposal all those composing our squadron, and assure him that the emperor would consider his presence on board one of our vessels as a distinguished honour conferred on the Russian navy" Nor, Sir, was this all. His majesty the emperor of Russia, with a condescension, which I understand, is not usually shown in such a manner, gave directions to count de Nesselrode to inquire of count de Heiden in what possible way his majesty could confer a mark of honour and distinction on the son of sir E. Codrington, who was wounded on that "glorious day." Sir, I cannot help thinking that all these letters and messages must be considered as affording an undeniable proof of what was the opinion upon this subject of a personage who must be as rigorous a judge in such matters, and as capable of forming a sound opinion respecting them, as any human being living. What was the case with the French court? That his majesty the king of France lost no time in conferring on sir E. Codrington one of the highest dignities in his power to bestow. This was followed by another circumstance, which I am told by some friends who are acquainted with the etiquette generally observed in such cases, is far from being a usual occurrence; namely, that when an officer, captain Fellowes of the Dartmouth, deputed by sir E. Codrington, waited upon the king of France, to convey our gallant admiral's thanks for the honour which he had received, his majesty conferred an Order of a less distinguished character on the gentleman who had been so deputed. But, let us also look at the king of France's Speech in opening his Chambers. What is his mention of the battle? "The affairs of the East," says he, "alone present some difficulties; but the treaty which I have signed with the king of England and the emperor of Russia, has laid the groundwork for the pacification of Greece; and, I have reason to hope, that the combined efforts of myself and my allies will triumph over the resistance of the Ottoman Porte, without having recourse to force. The unexpected battle of Navarin has been at the same time an occasion of glory to our arms, and the most distinguished proof of the union of the three flags." Here we have the deserved praise given to the treaty of London&#x2014;the Turks threatened with force if they continue to resist&#x2014;the glory of the great battle manfully asserted&#x2014;and,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0195"/>
<col>375</col>
lastly, a suitable congratulation for the generous cordiality which graced and secured the victory of the combined squadrons. No tears for untoward successes&#x2014;no sighs for separation from his bloodstained eastern bride&#x2014;nothing but what is worthy of a Christian king&#x0021;<lb/>
Sir, why do I mention all these particulars? I mention them to show, that if we are backward in expressing our admiration of the gallant conduct of sir E. Codrington, we are the sole party of the different parties interested, by whom the slightest approach to any such feeling is entertained. If we do not by our vote of this night, confer on air E. Codrington the honour of our grateful acknowledgments for his gallant and spirited conduct at Navarin, it will be said that this country alone, of all the countries of Europe, is insensible to the splendor of the achievement. Our ingratitude will be the marvel and wonder of the world. It will begin to be suspected that we have some particular reason for our neglect. It will begin to be suspected that we are aware of some circumstances connected with, the battle, not known to others, which induce us, interested as we naturally must be in every thing which relates to the honour of our country, to withhold that approbation and that expression of gratitude, the refusal of which, under any other supposition, is wholly unaccountable. Sir, with respect to the battle itself, every man who hears me is so well acquainted with all the particulars relating to it, that I shall not think it necessary to trouble the House by going into any minute details on the subject. I am quite aware, that on former occasions, when any of his majesty's ministers have proposed votes of a similar nature, they have always accompanied the proposition by taking a short view of the circumstances attending the achievement in question. But I see around me so many individuals, much more qualified than I can be to speak on such topics&#x2014;and among them several old and gallant admirals, themselves of high renown in their profession, and whose knowledge will enable them to describe the various events of the battle much more satisfactorily than I can pretend to do&#x2014;that I shall consider it sufficient merely to say, that the House must be aware that, shortly after sir E. Codrington was sent to the Levant, he succeeded in establishing the armistice between the Greeks and the Turks. Supposing, very
<col>376</col>
naturally, that the terms of the armistice would be kept with good faith on both sides, sir Edward sent most of the king's ships under his command to Malta to refit. Shortly afterwards, however, he found that the Pacha Ibrahim, who commanded the Turkish fleet, did not entertain the same notions of the nature of the armistice that he himself did. The pacha despatched a squadron to relieve the Turks, who were at that time besieged at Patras by a Greek force. Although sir E. Codrington had with him only a single ship of the line, a frigate, and two corvettes, he immediately sailed in pursuit of the Turkish squadron, and, in the most undaunted manner, placed himself between the Turks and the shore, in order to prevent them from carrying their object into effect. In pursuance of the same determination, and finding that it was not the intention of the Turks to adhere to the conditions of the armistice, sir E. Codrington immediately sent orders to the British ships at Malta to complete their re-fitting with, all possible speed. These orders were obeyed with an alacrity highly creditable to all parties; and in the course of six days, the whole proceeded to join their gallant admiral.<lb/>
I ought now, perhaps, Sir, to mention the comparative force of the contending parties previous to the battle. The Ottoman fleet consisted of three sail of the line, four double-banked frigates, seventeen frigates, forty-nine corvettes, and eight fire-ships; being in all eighty-one vessels of war, besides forty transports. Those who are acquainted with the place know, and those who are not may observe on examining the map, that in the bay of Navarin there are many very formidable batteries. By those of New Navarin many lives were unfortunately lost in the event. The Allied fleet consisted of ten sail of the line, ten frigates, and six corvettes; making twenty-six vessels of war. The number of guns in the Turkish squadron was two thousand two hundred and forty, the number in the combined squadron one thousand three hundred and fifty-four. There were the Turkish batteries in addition. Without any exaggeration, therefore, I may fairly say, that the victory which followed was, in proportion to the extent of the force engaged, one of the most splendid on record. Let us now see what was the loss of the Combined squadrons;&#x2014;

It appears, Sir, that the Asia, forming the van of the fleet, and commanded by the gallant British admiral, almost with her own broadsides destroyed two of the hostile line-of-battle ships. And here I beg leave to mention, on undoubted testimony, a fact which I believe has already appeared in the public prints&#x2014;that twice during the action the quarter deck of the Asia was cleared, with the exception of sir E. Codrington himself, who was left upon it alone [hear, hear&#x0021;]. But what is there of wonderful in heroic achievement which. British seamen have not exhibited? Perhaps the House will forgive me if I mention another anecdote, which shows in the clearest point of view the cordial union that existed among the three flags. It will be recollected, that a twenty-eight gun frigate, the Talbot, captain Spencer, bore down, and engaged for nearly an hour two Turkish ships, of heavy metal, carrying each sixty-four guns; and whose fire was consequently very destructive to the British frigate. It is also to be recollected, that captain Hugon of the French frigate, the Armide, seeing the condition of the Talbot, nobly placed his ship between her and one of the Turkish vessels, which he soon captured. What I wish to add to these well-known facts is this: when captain Hugon pulled down the Turkish flag, such were the generosity and delicacy of the gallant Frenchman, that he did not hoist the French flag alone, but hoisted the French and British flags united; thereby intimating, that he had only terminated the contest which our brave countrymen had begun [cries of "hear, hear, hear&#x0021;" from all parts of the House.] I mention this, Sir, as a proof of the complete union that existed among the squadrons; a union which was not confined to the action itself, but which evinced itself in all the subsequent occurrences.<lb/>
Sir, I think that what I have said on this part of the subject is quite sufficient for the purpose of showing the character of this brilliant achievement; which, indeed, was thus justly described in the general orders issued by sir E. Codrington on leaving the bay of Navarin, on the 24th of October;&#x2014;" Out of a fleet composed
<col>378</col>
of eighty-one ships of war, only one frigate and fifteen smaller vessels are in a condition which will ever allow them again to go to sea." I repeat, that I am perfectly justified in contending that, considering the amount of force engaged, there is no naval action in our annals, the result of which was so completely decisive, and on the merits of which it is utterly impossible that there can be any difference of opinion [hear, hear&#x0021;]. I have also a right to say, that we have the best proof of the merit and value of this action, not only in the destruction of the fleet to which the allied squadrons were opposed, but also in the present condition of things. Since the action there has been an almost total cessation of warlike and hostile proceedings. I understand from the latest accounts, that, in those parts where but recently nothing but piracy and the most flagrant acts of violence were perpetrated, the state of affairs is such, both on land and at sea, as to afford every prospect, that no serious obstacle will interpose itself to the complete execution of the treaty of London, to the pacification of the Greeks, and to the settlement of those questions by which that country has been so long agitated [hear, hear&#x0021;].<lb/>
After all this, Sir, I hope that I shall not find any person inclined to deny that the individual to whom so much of public benefit is attributable is entitled to public gratitude. It is true that I heard something dropped the other evening of its only having been a "barbarous" force that sir Edward Codrington had to contend with. A barbarous force&#x0021; Look at the number of killed and wounded in the contest with this barbarous force&#x0021; If these objectors talk of a barbarous force, what, pray, are the Algerines, for chastising whom lord Exmouth received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament? If they talk of a barbarous force, what, pray, are the Indians; victories over whom have repeatedly been rewarded with the thanks of both Houses of Parliament; although it will hardly be contended, that the Indian native armies can be compared to the naval forces of Turkey.<lb/>
I contend, Sir, and with justice, that the recent struggle was a great one; but I can mention various cases from which it is evident that the greatness of the struggle has not been usually considered as the criterion by which to determine the propriety of voting parliamentary approbation.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0197"/>
<col>379</col>
For example, there was the affair of Copenhagen. The Danish fleet made no resistance. Not a shot was fired by our navy; yet our admiral received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament. There have been many similar cases. Admiral Bertie and admiral Stopford were thanked by parliament, merely for their cordial cooperation with the army in India, although the navy was not actually engaged in hostilities. Admiral Keith was thanked for his assistance in landing troops id Egypt; admirals De Courcy and Hood for their conduct in the embarkation of the British army at Corunna. Admiral Hotham received the thanks of parliament for an engagement in which only two Sail of the line were taken; but by which he prevented the recapture of Corsica. Being a man whose modesty was equal to his courage, in expressing his gratitude for the honour which he had received, he qualified the service which he had performed with the word "advantage." It is true that, in the case of sir George Byng, in 1718, no parliamentary thanks were voted; but, Sir, I find, upon examining the public records of those times, that thanks were hardly ever voted to the navy by parliament. From the time of admiral Blake, in the period of the Commonwealth, to the time of admiral Osborne, in 1758, there does not appear&#x2014;at least, I have Hot been able to find a notice of it in the Journals&#x2014;to have been any vote of thanks to the navy. The thanks of parliament were confined to Marlborough, to the duke of Ormond, and to the achievements of our land-forces. But since the days of Osborne, the names of Vernon, Rodney, Pocock, Cornish, Hood, Howe, Duncan, Nelson, Keith, Saumarez, Cochrane, Strahan, and Exmouth, attest, that no British admiral has failed to obtain, when deserved, this great national reward.<lb/>
I now wish to apply myself to the observations which fell, the other evening, from the noble Secretary at War on this subject. The noble lord said, he should object to this vote, because there was no precedent of thanks having been voted, when the country over whose forces the victory had been achieved was a neutral state. The instance of Copenhagen appears to me to be a complete answer to the noble lord's observation. It is acknowledged by all parties, that at the time of the Copenhagen affair a perfect neutrality existed towards this country on the part
<col>380</col>
of the Danes. The justification of our conduct, which was set up, upon that occasion, was not that the Danes were not neutral, but that they were too weak to resist any attempt by France to avail itself of their naval means. The best proof that Denmark was considered neutral, appears in the fact, that the Owners of no fewer than three hundred and fifty Danish merchantmen having applied to the Crown Prince to ascertain if their ships would be safe in the ports of this country, were told by him, that they would of course be safe, as the neutrality of Denmark had been acknowledged by Great Britain. If the relations of Turkey with this country justify the refusal to thank sir Edward Codrington for the victory of Navarin, the relations of Denmark with this country would have justified a refusal to thank our commanders for the affair at Copenhagen. But that is not the only instance of this nature. There is another, as complete. I allude to the attack on Algiers by lord Exmouth. There are many points of strong resemblance between the circumstances of the attack on Algiers, and those of the attack on the Turkish fleet at Navarin. The former was preceded by a league formed among the Christian Sovereigns of Europe, for the purpose of putting down the outrages of the African powers, and tranquillizing the Mediterranean. The late occurrence was also preceded by a league to tranquillize the Mediterranean. In fulfilment of the conditions of the former league, the British admiral sailed into the Mediterranean with a united squadron, and appeared before Tunis and Tripoli, where he amicably adjusted all matters in dispute. He then proceeded to Algiers. In the first instance, the Dey seemed disposed to agree to the propositions which were made to him. Lord Exmouth was induced to believe that it would be unnecessary to resort to any violent measure. In the intermediate time, however, came news of the massacre of a number of Christians in the territories of the Dey. Lord Exmouth hesitated no longer: he entered the harbour of Algiers, and completed the object of his mission. And, what said his majesty's ministers, and what said the king himself, on the subject? On the meeting of parliament, the Session was opened by a Speech from the Throne. The prince regent, acting in the name and on behalf of his majesty, uttered these remarkable words:&#x2014;
<image src="S2V0018P0I0198"/>
<col>381</col>
"The splendid achievment of his majesty's fleet, in conjunction with a squadron of the king of the Netherlands, under the gallant and able conduct of admiral viscount Exmouth, led to the immediate and unconditional liberation of all Christian captives then within the territory of Algiers, and to the renunciation by its government of the practice of Christian slavery. I am persuaded that you will be duly sensible of the importance of an arrangement so interesting to humanity, and reflecting, from the manner in which it has been accomplished, such signal honour on the British nation."
These words, Sir, with a very trifling alteration, would apply exactly to the victory of Navarin. And when lord Castlereagh moved the thanks of the House of Commons to lord Exmouth for his gallant conduct, he said that "he was sure the House would feel a peculiar gratification in seeing the arms of Holland united with ours for the general liberties of mankind." So in the attack on the Turks at Navarin. Was not its object the general liberties of mankind? Was not its purpose that of reading a severe lesson to those who were showing themselves the enemies of those liberties? In speaking of the attack on Algiers, lord Castlereagh said, "There never was a military transaction, the character of which, in all its bearings, redounded more to the honour of every individual concerned in it; for though the enemy might be inferior in scientific excellence, and in the knowledge of modern warfare, yet sufficient proof was given during the battle that the arm of this country was never turned against a foe more capable of opposing an obstinate and fierce resistance." What can be more true than this passage of lord Castlereagh's speech, as applied to the foe with whom sir Edward Codrington had to contend? The motion made by lord Castlereagh was seconded by an ingenious young gentleman of great talent and eloquence, Mr. Law. What has since become of that young gentleman, whether in his maturer years he has realised the promise of his more youthful days, it does not become me to inquire [a laugh]. Mr. Law, in the course of his observations on the occasion to which I have alluded, made use of this appropriate phrase:&#x2014;"It was a noble enterprise, brilliantly achieved, in a great cause." Sir, I beg to say that these words of that eloquent young gentleman, Mr. Law, are
<col>382</col>
strictly applicable to the battle of Navarin; it was "a noble enterprise, brilliantly achieved, in a great cause." The number of men killed in the attack on Algiers was less than the number killed in the battle of Navarin; although the number of wounded was greater in the former than in the latter affair. But, as I have already remarked, the question before us is not a question of loss or resistance (Although, in both those respects, the battle of Navarin may challenge comparison with any other conflict of a similar character); the question is, whether or not the achievement reflects honour upon those by whom it was performed; perfectly leaving alone the question as to the policy of the measure. I say that it did reflect the highest honour upon those by whom it was performed; I say, that after the high testimony which has been borne to that fact, parliament cannot refuse to express its gratitude, unless something hitherto unknown can be brought forward to justify us in passing over what, I repeat, in the words of that ingenious and eloquent young gentleman, Mr. Law, was "a noble enterprise, brilliantly achieved, in a good cause" [hear, hear&#x0021;].<lb/>
Sir, I have been endeavouring to discover what can be the objection of those persons who oppose my present proposition; and I declare, with the utmost sincerity, that I cannot understand or conjecture what that objection can possibly be. It may perhaps hinge upon something which fell from a right hon. gentleman the other night who intimated, that while negotiations were pending, it would not be wise or justifiable to enter upon the discussion of the subject, in the absence of that knowledge which the papers connected with it could alone furnish. Why, Sir, that may be a very good argument against the discussion of the policy which led to the battle of Navarin; but as it respects the conduct of the admiral in that battle, it is no argument at all. For with respect to that conduct, we know all that we ever can know. That conduct has been examined and criticised by the parties the most interested, and they concur in approving it, and in declaring that in every thing that sir Edward Codrington did, he was borne out by his instructions. As far, therefore, as relates to the conduct of the British admiral, we want no further information, we want no further documents. If we do it is the fault of his majesty's government
<image src="S2V0018P0I0199"/>
<col>383</col>
for not having produced them; and it would be monstrous indeed, if they were to adduce their own neglect as a bar to the reward to which valour and skill are entitled. Sir Edward Codrington's conduct deserves either great praise or great blame. There can be no medium. If I thought the admiral acted contrary to his instructions, I would propose to censure him; but, knowing as I know, and as we all know, that he did not do so, I must persevere in maintaining, that he has most richly earned our applause.<lb/>
Another argument it is just possible may be used. I really cannot believe it will; but in the vague, indefinite search for reasons, on which an objection to my motion may be founded, it has occurred to me as just possible, that somebody may say that the House of Commons ought not to thank sir Edward Codrington, because, by so doing, we should exasperate Turkey. It is possible, that there may be two or three worthy old gentlemen in this country, who imagine that the Reis Effendi sits every morning sipping his coffee with "The Times" newspaper in his hand, reading the debates in the English House of Commons with the most sensitive attention to their tenor. It is possible that these worthy persons may fancy, that of all people who have pursued a mad policy, the Turks are the most mad; that they might overlook the sound beating they received at Navarin, that they might be unaffected by the loss of their navy, but that they would be urged into all the fury of a desperate revenge by a vote of the English House of Commons. Sir, in my younger days I spent some time in Turkey; and if the apprehension of these worthy persons be true, then the "march of intellect" has made a greater progress in that country than it ever did at any period in any other part of the world [a laugh]. Why, Sir, while I was in habits of intercourse with a number, of very respectable Mussulmans, I never met with more than one man who had even ever heard of the English House of Commons [a laugh]. That individual, a man of elevated rank, had a distinguished English officer and a distinguished French gentleman residing with him; and from them he might, perhaps, obtain information as to what was passing at the various courts of Europe. I remember that when this individual asked me if I belonged to the English House of Commons, I was as
<col>384</col>
much astonished as I should have been if he had asked me some profound mathematical question; and I can assure any one who may be alarmed lest by any vote of ours we may chance to exasperate the Turks, that it would require a great deal of ingenuity to make a Turk understand what the word "vote" means; and that he would be apt to think a great part of the explanation necessary for that purpose what in this country is commonly called "hoaxing." We need have no fear, therefore, of exasperating the Turks by any vote of the English parliament.<lb/>
But, Sir, I will tell you how we may perhaps have already exasperated them. To me it seems very likely, that the Grand Signior will be greatly exasperated when he finds himself called by the king of England "his ancient ally." What&#x0021; the brother of the Sun and Moon&#x0021; the Lord of the Black and White Seas the Vicar of Mahomet&#x0021; To class him with a mere lord of merchants&#x0021; With the master of infidel slaves, who are permitted to sell scissors, and to buy raisins in the Levant&#x0021; That is indeed calculated to make the grand Turk angry. All those, Sir, who know as I know, the way in which our ambassador at Turkey is treated, will feel how impossible it is that the grand Turk can for a moment condescend to consider any Christian sovereign as his ally or his friend. Any one who has witnessed the painful ceremonial to which I allude, will allow that it is impossible to express a greater assumption of unmeasurable superiority, than that which the Turks evince towards our ambassador at a public audience at Constantinople. The fact is, Sir, that as to any fear of exasperating the Turks by our vote, such fear there can be none. If we wish to carry into effect the treaty of London, we need not be under any apprehension, that the negotiation will be broken off by the House of Commons passing a vote of thanks to sir Edward Codrington. There is only one thing of which we have reason to be afraid;&#x2014;not of exasperating the Grand Signior, but of giving to prince Metternich and the Austrian cabinet any reason to hope or expect, that we are disposed in the least to flinch from our determination [hear, hear&#x0021;]. If there be the least danger of our negotiation being disturbed, that danger will proceed not from a vote of the House of Commons, but from a courier from Vienna
<image src="S2V0018P0I0200"/>
<col>385</col>
[hear, hear&#x0021;]. If, however, the right hon. gentlemen opposite and their colleagues concur in opinion, that there is only one way of carrying the policy hitherto pursued by this country into effect; namely, by determined perseverance, I have no doubt that they will be able fully to accomplish the desirable object in view.<lb/>
Sir, I shall take the liberty of including, in my proposed Vote of Thanks, the admirals commanding the French and Russian squadrons [hear, hear&#x0021;]. In doing this, I follow the precedents of former times; when the British parliament voted their thanks to the admiral of the Netherlands for his conduct before Algiers. It is no doubt a great and glorious distinction for us, that we are able to confer such honours as are esteemed not only by our fellow-subjects, but by the subjects of other countries. This is the great and glorious privilege of freemen. Their praise is valued not only by their fellow-citizens, but by all nations, and in all times. They assume, and are allowed to possess, that moral influence over human conduct, which the mightiest of despotic monarchs would in vain attempt to acquire. No one has described the true value of these national honours in language more appropriate, more eloquent, than the present chief of the administration. When he stood on this floor to receive the thanks of parliament for his services at Copenhagen, he used these striking expressions:&#x2014;" This honour thus bestowed is an object of high and ardent ambition to every officer of the army and navy, and the principal motive of those acts of valour and heroic courage, which have raised the glory of the British arms, and swelled the reputation of British prowess to its present imposing grandeur."<lb/>
It is impossible, Sir, for me to add any thing to this eloquent expression on the part of the noble duke. Since that day the duke of Wellington has received the thanks of parliament no less than eleven times; and I may be permitted to name the glorious occasions&#x2014;for the triumphs were not only his but yours. They were the triumphs of England, of Europe, I may say of" the whole civilized world. He was thanked for Vimiera, for the defence of Portugal, for the battle of Talavera, for the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, for the taking of Badajos, for the battle of Salamanca, for the battle of Vittoria, for entering France, for the battle of Orthes, for his general services up to the peace of 1814,
<col>386</col>
for the great battle of Waterloo, and lastly, for the whole of his wonderful career up to the day of the peace in 1815. Will this hero, then, bending as it were under the weight of his laurels&#x2014;will he refuse a solitary hard-won wreath to the brows of a gallant officer, who has more than the ordinary claim to his generosity; because, belonging to a rival service&#x2014;a service, however, whose rivalry with our armies has consisted only in the noble strife which of the two should render most essential service to the interests, and best promote the glory of the country? And yet I have heard it whispered, that the administration, with this great captain at their head, have exerted themselves to oppose this motion; and that the usual means have been resorted to, in order to obtain a muster of their friends. I have even heard, that the note from the office at which the duke himself presides addresses his adherents in the strongest terms: "You are earnestly and particularly requested," "earnestly and particularly requested"&#x0021;&#x0021; to do what? to prevent one of the most gallant of your countrymen from reaping the due reward of his heroic exertions. Impossible&#x0021; if we do so forget ourselves, the shame will not be his, it will be ours. But I will not, I cannot, anticipate the rejection of this proposal. When I recollect whom I am addressing&#x2014;when I see so many distinguished officers of both services, and amongst them the gallant representative of the Navy-board&#x2014;himself an ornament to his profession&#x2014;when I behold on these benches so many of those ministers who framed the Treaty of London, and who sent the gallant officer to carry it into effect&#x2014;when I see around me the representatives of a nation resembling, in many glorious distinctions, the free states of antiquity, but guiltless of the vice which disgraced the old republican communities&#x2014;when on every side of me I behold those who, differing on other points, have always united to honour their brave countrymen in arms; it is impossible that I should contemplate, that on this so fair an occasion, we should afford so shameful an exception to our former generous practice, and that the Commons of England should, for the first time, in the history of our country, seem indifferent to, and neglect the upholders of our national renown. If this is to be so, then, indeed, the day of Navarin will be the glory and the shame of England; and history, recording the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0201"/>
<col>387</col>
name of the undaunted seaman, to whom it is due, will make this mournful confession:&#x2014;" His merits were acknowledged by his own sovereign, foreign potentates made haste to honour him, rival nations conspired to praise him, but his fellow-subjects were unmindful of his prowess, and would contribute nothing to his fame, domestic jealousies had mastered their better feelings; they gloried in the triumph of a party; they forgot the interests of Christendom, and the champion of civilization" [loud cheers from both sides of the House]. The hon. member then moved, "That the Thanks of this House be given to Vice Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, Commander-in-chief of his Majesty's Ships and Vessels in the Mediterranean, for his able and gallant conduct in the successful and decisive action with the Turkish Fleet in the Bay of Navarin, on the 20th day of October fast; to the officers, seamen and marines of the British squadron; and to the Russian and French admirals, officers, and seamen, who so gallantly supported the English admiral on that occasion."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00300"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> seconded the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00301"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> addressed the House, in a tone of voice nearly inaudible, he said, he thought that, until the House were in possession of all the instructions sent out to sir E. Codrington, they could not be competent to come to a rational decision as to the battle. By agreeing to the motion, the House would not only be doing honour to the gallant admiral, but would also sanction the treaty that had been alluded to; which, in his opinion, they ought not to do. The hon. mover had expressed a hope, that government would carry that treaty into effect. Did he mean that government was to carry it into effect by a war? The British admiral had no right to demand an armistice. That, however, he did do, and threatened, that if it was not agreed to, ulterior measures would be resorted to. What measures were referred to, might be imagined from the sanguinary and disastrous victory of Navarino. He regretted the manner in which our old ally had been treated: and he had a right to call Turkey our "old ally," for a treaty was framed between this country and Turkey in 1675, which recited other previously existing relations between them. He feared that England would have cause
<col>388</col>
to regret that she had lent herself to the views of Russia. Upon this point, he would quote a line of admonition:&#x2014;" Who helps a powerful friend 'fore arms a foe."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00302"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> declared himself disappointed with the speech of the hon member who spoke last. He was at all times unwilling to address the House unnecessarily, and he had therefore fondly anticipated, that the result of the hon. member's speech would be the giving of a conclusive argument against the motion, and that it would not be necessary for him to trespass on their patience. But he was sorry to say that he had not heard from the hon. member one word which appeared to him to bear upon the question before the House. The hon. member had been pleased, in a manner not, he thought, altogether consistent with the usual courtesy of parliamentary proceedings, to enter into a discussion upon the merits of our intercourse with France and Russia, and the different steps taken at different periods, with a view to the pacification of Greece. Now, he really thought, that after the House had been told by the ministers of the Crown the reasons which precluded them&#x2014;very reluctantly&#x2014;from giving to the House the information which could alone enable parliament to come to a just conclusion on the subject, it would have been more fair and consistent to have adhered to the line very properly chalked out by the hon. member for Westminster&#x2014;to have waved the consideration of the policy of the treaty, and to have confined his attention strictly to the motion which, he could not avoid saying, had been so indiscreetly brought before them. His hon. friend had said, that the object of the treaty, as he read it, was totally different from that of the protocol signed at St. Petersburgh in April, 1826. Now, he utterly denied that position. It was necessary to look both to the treaty and the protocol for the objects of the parties to them, and the motives which influenced the proceedings they had adopted. In both documents the objects which the contracting parties professed to have in view, and which they pledged themselves to effect, was the reconciliation of the Porte with Greece, and the pacification of the Levant. That was the object which was brought prominently forward.&#x2014;His hon. friend had talked of fraud, conspiracy, trick, and violence; but he certainly could not have
<image src="S2V0018P0I0202"/>
<col>389</col>
read the treaty of the 6th of July attentively, if he had not found, that it was framed with the view of re-establishing peace between the contending parties, by means of an arrangement which was called for, as much by humanity as by the interest of the repose of Europe. The first article stated "The contracting powers will offer to the Ottoman Porte their mediation, with the view of bringing about a reconciliation between it and the Greeks." It could not, it appeared to him, be doubted, that the object of the contracting powers throughout was the preservation of the tranquillity of Europe, and the reconciliation of the Porte with Greece. His hon. friend might quarrel with the means adopted to carry the treaty into effect. That point he would not now discuss; but to the assertion, that the object of the treaty was not one of conciliation he gave a most unqualified denial. He would not attempt to follow his hon. friend through the arguments which he had raised on this most complicated question. It was sufficient for him to state, that for seven years the peace of Europe had been placed in jeopardy by a war which, if continued, could end in nothing but the extermination of one of the parties, and a state of things which, if not put down would interrupt the tranquillity of Europe, which it was the object of this country particularly to preserve, and which, if once broken, might lead to the most fearful and extensive consequences. His hon. friend had expressed his surprise, how those who pretended to be the disciples of Mr. Pitt, could suppose that they were promoting the interests of England, by venturing upon such an interference with the internal concerns of an independent nation, as the world had seen in the treaty of the 6th of July. Now, he professed himself to be one of those individuals who took a pride in adopting the policy of that great man, Mr. Pitt; and he said, that the policy of this country, not only during the time of Mr. Pitt, but of Mr. Fox, and indeed of all the distinguished statesmen who had directed its councils, was not to interfere unnecessarily with the domestic concerns of other nations, but certainly not to withhold our interference, whenever it became necessary, to re-establish the peace and harmony of the world, and to restore a good understanding among contending powers. It was no departure from the law of nations, but a sound application of their
<col>390</col>
principles, to interpose under such circumstances. His hon. friend had quoted the example of Holland in the year 1787, and had admitted that Mr. Pitt received the approbation of his great rival Mr. Fox, for his interposition on that occasion. Under what circumstances did that interposition take place? The king of Prussia thought that an insult had been offered by the States of Holland to his sister, the wife of the Stadtholder. Was that, it was asked, a fit object for British interference? Certainly not. But then there was a French faction in the country, which was obtaining a preponderating influence. If that were so, then what became of his hon. friend's principle, that we were not to interfere in the domestic concerns of another, even for the preservation of that balance of power, without which it was impossible to hope for the continuance of peace? Such had never been either the doctrine or the practice of those who had hitherto directed the destinies of England. We had endeavoured never to interfere gratuitously in the internal concerns of independent nations; but whenever we had interposed, our interposition had always been directed to effect the preservation of the peace of Europe. He was quite sure that his hon. friend, when he should hereafter peruse all the documents connected with the treaty of the 6th of July, would be convinced, that a war in the east of Europe, which would have placed the tranquillity of the whole of Europe in jeopardy, had been completely prevented by the interposition of England. He must repeat, that he could by no means agree with the conclusion to which his hon. friend wished to bring the House; namely, that the county had been guilty of gross injustice, in acceding to the treaty of the 6th of July. The object of that treaty, the only end it was intended to attain, was the same which we had in view, when we signed the protocol of St. Petersburgh&#x2014;was the same which we had in view during the time of lord Strangford's residence at Constantinople; namely, the general pacification of Europe without going to war, and the prevention of that state of things, which, if it once came into existence, must necessarily lead, at one day or other, to a general war throughout&#x0021; Europe. No one, he thought, would expect him to state, on the present occasion, what measures the government was adopting to give effect to that treaty. The
<image src="S2V0018P0I0203"/>
<col>391</col>
reasons why he should not enter upon such a statement were too obvious to require repetition. He was certain it would be enough for him to state, that the government was proceeding fully, fairly, and faithfully, to execute the treaty, in the same spirit in which it had entered into it, in concert with our august allies.&#x2014;He had stated already, and he would repeat the statement, that he regretted extremely that the hon. member for Westminster had brought forward his motion at this particular time. The hon. member seemed to think that there was considerable advantage to the public service, in motions for giving the thanks of parliament to officers and men who had distinguished themselves in the battles of the country&#x2014;originated by individuals who were unconnected with the government, and unfettered by party. The hon. member had stated, that there were occasions when such honours would be rendered more gratifying to the individuals on whom they were bestowed, by the circumstance of their having been proposed by the party which was in opposition to the government, and which, therefore, could have no share in planning the expedition which they had carried to a successful termination. He would not deny the abstract proposition, that there might be such occasions, but sure he was, that the present was not an occasion on which it would be either prudent or politic to make such an experiment, as the hon. member had recommended. It was impossible for the hon. member to be acquainted with all the circumstances which had reference to this transaction. The hon. member thought himself much better informed respecting them, than he really was; for he had stated, among other things, that he knew that the report, which had been made by a gallant friend of his, who had been sent into the Mediterranean to inquire into the circumstances preceding the battle of Navarino, had been perfectly satisfactory upon all points.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00303"><member>Mr. Hobhouse.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;" I did not say upon all points, but upon most."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00304"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;I can only say, that if the hon. member has that knowledge, his knowledge far exceeds mine. I do not mean by this to say, that there is any thing deficient in the explanation of the transaction, which has been sent home by the gallant admiral who commands in the Mediterranean. But I do say this, that no report has come to my knowledge, or,
<col>392</col>
as far as I am informed, to the knowledge of any member of his majesty's government, conveying any opinion of my gallant friend to the effect stated by the hon. member. The hon. member assumes, that his case is completely established, on the report of the gallant officer to whom I alluded. Now, it so happens, that the gallant officer in question was not called on to make a report, and that he has not, as far as I know, made any.&#x2014;Before I proceed further, I cannot help noticing the fact, that the hon. member has more than once insinuated, that the great honour which he considers to be due to sir E. Codrington, and the gallant men who served under his command, is refused, owing to the changes which have recently taken place in the cabinet, owing to some paltry intrigue which he conceives to have been going forward, or, to use his own words, owing to the better passions having been absorbed by domestic jealousy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00305"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution>,&#x2014;The right hon. gentleman is labouring under a gross mistake. I did not utter the sentiment he has attributed to me. I did not speak positively but hypothetically. I said&#x2014;if ministers act so and so towards sir E. Codrington, people will say so and so of them, and the conclusions to which future historians will come, will be, that the better passions were absorbed by domestic jealousies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00306"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, he was happy to hear the explanation of the hon. member. He asserted, however, that there never had existed on the part of any cabinet which had been formed since the battle of Navarino, the smallest intention to propose the thanks of parliament to the officers and men who were engaged in that affair. He would tell the hon. member the reason why such an intention could not enter into the mind of any prudent and sensible minister. It was this:&#x2014;we voted the thanks of parliament for triumphs over our enemies&#x2014;we voted them to mark our satisfaction, that in a conflict which we had foreseen and directed, with a power against which we had declared war, the skill and gallantry and zeal of our officers had triumphed over the skill and gallantry and zeal of our enemies, and that they had maintained, by that skill, gallantry, and zeal, the ancient superiority of our country above all others. But, could any reasonable man think of passing a similar vote on the present occasion, unless a precedent were quoted in justifica-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0204"/>
<col>393</col>
tion of it from the records of parliament? He was ready to maintain that no precedent could be found which would justify the House in giving a vote of thanks to any officer for a catastrophe which ended in a lamentable effusion of blood which we had never intended to shed, and in the total destruction of the naval force of an ally whom we never intended to injure. Would it be right to mark our sense of such an accident, and he might say of such a misfortune&#x2014;for being an accident, it was also a misfortune&#x2014;by voting the thanks of parliament to the authors of it-he said it not invidiously&#x2014;as we should vote them for a victory obtained in time of open and declared war? &#x2014;The hon. member seemed to think he had found a case which ran completely parallel with the present, in the vote of thanks which was given to the officers and soldiers employed in the expedition sent to Copenhagen in 1807. The hon. member felt how weak his argument was on this point; for he laboured exceedingly, in endeavouring to draw a distinction between approving the conduct and approving the policy of the war. Now, with all due deference to the hon. member, it appeared quite unnecessary to draw any such distinction. How many gentlemen were there who disapproved altogether of the policy of the war, from its commencement to its close; and who yet whilst we were engaged in the war, never when a case arose which called upon parliament to acknowledge, by its thanks, the gallantry of our soldiers and sailors, thought of mixing up the question of their gallantry with that of the policy which rendered the display of it necessary. He would now ask the House to consider what was the case at Copenhagen. Instructions were distinctly given to our commanders by sea and land to attack and capture that capital, and to use their best exertions for the attainment of that object. They were likewise told, that they were to consider eight days as the utmost extent of the period during which they were to abstain from hostilities. It so happened that, before one of those eight days had expired the king of Denmark issued a declaration of war against England. He would not now speak of the policy of the expedition to Copenhagen, as the hon. member did not pretend to dispute its wisdom, being now more enlightened as to the grounds on which it was sent out, than the individuals were who attacked the
<col>394</col>
justice of it at the time, without knowing any thing of the causes which led to it. It was sufficient for him to say, that what was done at Copenhagen was done in consequence of direct and positive orders from the government at home; and that we were, moreover, placed in a state of war with Denmark by the declaration of the Danish government. But was this or any thing like this, the state of affairs between the English and the Turkish governments in the Mediterranean? No such thing. We were bound by the treaty of the 6th of July to interpose our forces between the contending parties, in order to bring about an armistice <i>de facto,</i> in case it could not be otherwise obtained. He would not enter into the question, whether Ibrahim Pacha had or had not broken the terms of the armistice which had been first made between him and the gallant officer who commanded our squadron. He believed that he had. He would only say, that the gallant admiral did not enter the bay of Navarino with a view of attacking the Turkish fleet, but with a view of obtaining, by his position, a compliance with the terms of the armistice which he had settled with its commander Ibrahim Pacha. Upon entering that bay, there ensued a scene in which the greatest skill, seamanship, and gallantry, were evinced by sir E. Codrington and every officer and man under his command. It was no small addition to the praise which the gallant admiral had obtained by his valour and skill, that he had effected that, which it was not always easy to effect, when the forces of rival powers were employed together for a joint object, that he had conciliated them by his conduct, and had thereby produced a unity of purpose and a harmony of design, which could not have been exceeded, if the force employed had been entirely British, and under the command of a British officer, as much beloved, as sir E. Codrington had the happiness of being by every man who sailed under his orders.&#x2014;Having made this statement, he hoped he should, not hereafter be accused of underrating the skill or valour of sir E. Codrington, because he could not accede to the present motion. The affair in which he had so eminently distinguished himself, was not a battle between enemies, it was an accident&#x2014;a misfortune&#x2014;which could not be foreseen, nor perhaps, under the circumstances, avoided: it was an event which, in private life, would be styled a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0205"/>
<col>395</col>
chance-medley. He was convinced it would be so called in the verdict, if a coroner's jury could examine into the merits of it. But it did not follow that, because it was chance-medley, there might not have been exhibited in it as much gallantry and skill as was ever exhibited by the bravest men in the noblest exploits of ancient or modern warfare.&#x2014;The hon. member for Westminster had made another groundless assumption. He had assumed, that sir John Gore had been sent to make inquiries in the Mediterranean, because a foreign newspaper, the "Austrian Observer," had circulated sundry calumnies, detrimental to the character of the British admiral. This was the first time he had ever heard such a reason assigned for sending out his gallant friend. Certainly, no such reason had influenced his majesty's government. The government certainly felt it was incumbent upon it to make further inquiries, as to the character of the armistice which had been established in the Morea, between the officer in command of the British squadron and the officer in command of the Turkish forces. The queries which had been sent out had received distinct and explicit answers; proving beyond a question, that there had been nothing precipitate or rash in the conduct of the officer commanding the British fleet. He Stated this the more willingly, because he was sincerely anxious that sir E. Codrington should stand clear of all blame in a transaction which, under the circumstances, was perhaps unavoidable. It was, however, the duty of government to ascertain that such was the character of the transaction. The hon. member must be convinced that it was an affair in which the country found much to lament, and that its issue was such as men of all parties could not fail to deprecate, so far as it regarded England: for he would not inquire whether it was, as the hon. member said it was, a good issue, as terminating hostilities between Greece and Turkey. It might or might not have that effect: time alone would show. But what was most likely to have been its immediate effect upon British interests? It might have led to the massacre of all the British subjects in the Turkish dominions, and to the confiscation of their property by the Porte. Fortunately it had not produced that result; but one of its negative effects was undeniable. It had not produced
<col>396</col>
the execution of the objects of the treaty of the 6th of July, as contemplated by those who signed it, and wished it to be executed without the effusion of human blood. The hon. member for Westminster had next referred to what had taken place when we sent an expedition to Algiers.&#x2014;He could tell the hon. member, that the gross ignorance which prevailed at Algiers respecting the extent of our resources and power, did not exist at Constantinople. Though the brother to the Sun and Moon, the lord of the Black, White, and Yellow Seas, the master of Millions, as the hon. member told us the sultan styled himself&#x2014;though he might look upon us as a set of traders, who did nothing but sell razors and buy raisins in the Levant, and might call our king the chief of a set of scissor-grinders, he could tell him, that the Reis Effendi was very well informed of every thing which passed in Europe, and was by no means deficient in the knowledge of European politics.&#x2014;The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to examine into the history of the expedition sent to Algiers under lord Exmouth. The hon. member for Westminster said, that our fleet went to Tunis and Tripoli and elsewhere, demanding and obtaining, from the governors of those places assurances that they would cease from cruising against all Christian flags; that our fleet next went to Algiers, where its demands were met, not with compliance but with refusal; that lord Exmouth waited a few days before the port, and then proceeded to attack and bombard it. Now, as far as he recollected it, the true version was this.&#x2014;Lord Exmouth returned from Algiers to England, and reported to the government, that he had not been able to make the same agreement with the Dey of Algiers as he had made with the other Barbary powers; for the Dey declared that he would persevere in cruising against the Christian powers, and in holding their subjects in captivity. What, then, took place? Lord Exmouth was sent back to Algiers with a greater number of ships, and with instructions to compel the Dey to submission. The analogy, therefore, between that case and the present completely failed. In the first case, there was an expedition sent out for a specific purpose&#x2014;of a hostile nature; that purpose was executed, and parliament was consequently called upon to praise the skill and gallantry which distinguished those
<image src="S2V0018P0I0206"/>
<col>397</col>
who took an active part in it. In the present case, the expedition was sent out for a pacific purpose; and out of an unexpected collision with the Turkish fleet arose that victory, which though it was honourable to our arms, was still not a subject for parliamentary congratulation. He was not to be deterred from the strict line of public duty by any appeals that might be made to his feelings on the nature of the contest between the Greeks and the Turks. Though, as a private, individual, he might have a strong opinion as to the character of the contest, and might sympathize with a population which had been ground down by the most intolerable slavery, as a public man, he could not yield to the influence of such feelings. He would say at once that such feelings were not sufficient of themselves to warrant the interference of any foreign state in the contest for the interests of the Greeks alone. If British interests were not endangered by the continuance of the conflict, we were not called upon to interfere&#x2014;nay, we were not justified in interfering&#x2014;on account of the cruel slavery to which the Greeks had been so long exposed. He was not to be deterred by the hon. member's saying, that if we did not bestow a vote of thanks on sir E. Codrington, we should be unjust not only to him, but to ourselves. He contended, that the present was an exception from the general rule established in the cases to which the hon. member had referred. He thought that he had demolished all the precedents which the hon. member had brought forward in support of his motion; but even if he had not, still there was a wide difference between this case and all such precedents. It would be a bad proceeding to proclaim a triumph and to indulge in the feelings of victory, where there had been neither an enemy, a triumph, nor a victory. He did not doubt the gallantry, nor dispute the discretion, of sir E. Codrington; but he must say to the House, "Be cautions before you create a precedent of thanks for an event which grew out of an accident, lest officers, looking at the signal benefit conferred on them by receiving such thanks, should cherish too easy a disposition to create such accidents, and lest such accidents so created should lead to consequences, which the country may long have reasons to regret."&#x2014;It surprised him more than all that the hon. member, who seemed aware that he should not receive
<col>398</col>
general support to his motion, and who knew well that if no change had taken place in the councils of his majesty, no such a proposal as was then before the House would have been made to it&#x2014;it surprised him more than all, that the hon. member, who had searched the records of parliament to find precedents in which thanks were conferred for brilliant actions like those at Navarino, should have overlooked one slight precedent which made completely against him. The hon. member had referred to the great exploits of the illustrious warrior who was now at the head of the government, and who had received the thanks of parliament no less than eleven times, for his distinguished services. He believed there was no man who heard him, who did not rejoice that they had so often had an opportunity of thanking that able chieftain. He believed that to the exploits which elicited those thanks we were indebted for the peace of Europe; and he further believed, that it was the intention of that unrivalled captain, to maintain that peace, undisturbed by his counsels in the cabinet, which he had been so instrumental in obtaining by his sword in the field. Did the hon. member ever hear of that most distinguished victory, which the British forces achieved at Toulouse? It was one of the most brilliant feats of arms in which the noble duke was ever engaged. He defeated marshal Soult; he drove him from an entrenched position, which even his own officers conceived too hazardous to attack; and he displayed, during the whole conflict, a combination of valour, skill, and coolness, which had never been excelled before. Though this was one of the most gallant achievements of the whole war, it was not noticed by parliament, because a cessation of arms had taken place before the intelligence of it reached England. In consequence of such omission, the late duke of Norfolk had asked, whether it was not intended to thank the duke of Wellington for that his last and greatest battle. Unquestionably his noble friend then at the: head of the government felt the importance of that battle; but what was the statement which his noble friend made in his place in parliament? It was this&#x2014;that as the war had ceased, he did not intend to propose a vote, which might tend to keep up a spirit of exasperation between the two nations.&#x2014;Having stated that fact, he would sit down, leaving it to the good
<image src="S2V0018P0I0207"/>
<col>399</col>
sense of the House to decide, whether it would in this case create a precedent which, if created, would be attended with inconvenience to the best interests of the country. Had the conflict which gave rise to this proposed vote of thanks taken place with a power with whom we were at war, he should not have had any reluctance, to confer the honour of their thanks upon sir E. Codrington and his brave followers; but, under present circumstances, he was obliged to withhold it, not from any wish to impute the slightest blame to that gallant officer, but from a wish to guard the country from future difficulty and inconvenience. He would not move a negative to the present motion, lest it should be supposed that he meant to deny the gallantry and skill of sir E. Codrington; but for the reasons which he had stated to the House, he would move the previous question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00307"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> said, that it had been so seldom his good fortune, during his parliamentary career, to coincide in opinion with the hon. member for Dorsetshire, that he embraced this opportunity of publicly declaring, that he did coincide, for once, with that hon. member. He entirely agreed with him in deploring the silence which was imposed upon hon. members, relative to this great question, by the alleged situation of the negotiations at Constantinople, and by the state of parties in the two Houses of parliament. He lamented the circumstances which prevented those who approved of the treaty of the 6th of July&#x2014;among whom he was proud to rank himself&#x2014;from stating the reasons on which their approbation was grounded. He agreed with the hon. member for Westminster&#x2014;who had delivered a speech, admirable in its kind, and which, so far from being ill-advised, or indiscreet, appeared to him to be a model of discretion&#x2014;that, with respect to the Treaty of London, there could be no medium: it was either one of the grossest infractions of the law of nations, or one of the most just, wise, generous, and disinterested compacts that ever was formed. After the general rumour that was abroad, that several persons had concurred in condemning the policy of that treaty, he could not refrain from entering his protest against being supposed to concur in their opinions. He believed the treaty of the 6th of July to be a just, a wise, a generous, and a disinterested compact. He
<col>400</col>
was prepared to contend, against any antagonist, that that treaty was not only founded upon principles of reason and justice, but that it was also conformable to the recognized principles of the law of nations. The question was not whether the interference could be justified by any positive rule of the law of nations&#x2014;for he was ready to admit that it was not&#x2014;but whether, considering the nature and state of the hostilities between Greece and Turkey, and their bearings on the condition of all Europe, it did not form an exception to the general rule. If he could not make this out&#x2014;and he confessed the <i>onus</i> was upon him to do so&#x2014;then he was ready to admit, that the hostile acts which had taken place were an infraction of the law of nations. But, could it be denied that there were cases in which to bring about an armed mediation was known to the law of nations? Was it not authorized by the best writers, by the most renowned jurists? Were there not precedents of such acts in the best times? And if there were no precedents&#x2014;if no public authority existed&#x2014;was the principle not obvious, that such an intervention as this country had practised on behalf of the Greeks was enjoined by the dictates of common humanity, by the paramount necessity of preserving the peace of Christendom, and by an unquestionably wise policy? On the one hand, it secured the peace and safety of all Europe, and on the other hand, instead of impairing, it tended to prop up and support the Ottoman power, as long as the vices and absurdities of that barbarous constitution would allow of. He was prepared to maintain, that the treaty of the 6th of July was the direct and inevitable consequence of that of the 5th of April; that the protocol of April, 1826, made the intervention necessary; and that, by the treaty of the 6th of July, it became a duty. He was prepared also to contend, in contradiction to a slander, which could have originated only in gross ignorance, that, instead of the interference which had been resorted to being a surprise on the Ottoman Porte, that government had been treated with extraordinary long suffering, with most exemplary patience, and with most unexpected forbearance. It was bare justice to Russia to say, that her dealings with the Ottoman power, for the last seven years, had been marked with as great forbearance, as the conduct
<image src="S2V0018P0I0208"/>
<col>401</col>
of that power had been distinguished by continued insolence and incorrigible contumacy. If any one was disposed to deny this, let them look to the history of the Servian deputies, and they must admit, that, if Russia were to be blamed at all, it was rather for the long patience she had exercised, than for any premature interference. By the treaty of Bucharest it was provided, that the people of Servia, amounting to about a million of Christians, should be governed by their own laws and magistrates, and that they should be exempt from all Turkish interference. A body of Servian deputies, appointed to carry the provisions of that treaty into effect, went to Constantinople for that purpose. What did our ancient allies, the Turks, do on that occasion? In what way did they evince their respect for the law of nations&#x2014;that rigid observance of treaties, for which they had, of late, been so much praised? They sent these deputies to the Seven Towers; and they justified this flagrant violation of justice by a pretence, that they did it to protect the persons of the deputies from the attacks of the populace. How did they prove the truth of this pretext? By keeping them in confinement for the period of seven years. And all this Russia endured. At the treaty of Ackermann they procured the release of those unfortunate deputies; but, even then, not until a Russian army had made its appearance on the Pruth. He addressed these observations particularly to the hon. member for Dorsetshire, who, he was free to confess, was a fair and candid opponent; and who had professed his desire to view the question divested of all the interests and opinions which might be attached to it by parties in this country. For himself, he looked upon it as a great question of national justice, and one which would attract the attention of posterity, when all that now appeared important would have become insignificant. It appeared, from the nature of the opposition which had been offered, that the grounds of that opposition were two-fold; for it would be impossible, if the treaty were justified, that the attack could be condemned. In order to be consistent in refusing the thanks of the House to the officers who had distinguished themselves, with a gallantry so honourable to themselves and to the country, it must be insisted, that their laurels had been gained in the performance
<col>402</col>
of an act of injustice. If that ground were maintained, then the admiral was entitled to the thanks of the House; for it would then be admitted, that he had not gone beyond his instructions; and no one attempted to deny that his exertions had been most gallant and successful. If he took the second objection, that, indeed, made the propriety of the admiral's conduct doubtful, in the sense which that objection would put upon it. It would imply, that it was questionable whether he had judged properly of the emergency in which he was placed; whether he had estimated the danger properly; and whether the case had happened in which he was authorized to resort to the force with which he was intrusted. This latter objection of necessity recognized and justified the treaty, and in the impossibility of reconciling these two points, he discovered the inconsistency of the argument of those who opposed this vote. It was clear that, by the last article of the Treaty, the high contracting powers bound themselves, in the event of the Turks refusing to acquiesce in the manner which was deemed necessary to secure the tranquillity of Europe, to bring about an armistice <i>de facto.</i> How did the hon. member think this was to be effected? &#x2014;by sprinkling the Turks and the Greeks with rosewater at the moment when they were most fiercely engaged? No; but by giving instructions to the admirals of the allied squadrons to exert such power as they possessed, to carry the object of the Treaty into execution. What, then, were the admirals to do? Were they to negociate? If they were, they were to negociate as admirals usually did, and as they could only do effectually&#x2014;that was, with their great guns. That was the only kind of representation that could have any effect upon the understandings of our ancient allies the Turks.&#x2014;He would not trouble the House with reading the last article of the Treaty, but he would request them to compare, from recollection, that article with the arrangement made by the admirals of the allied squadron off Navarino. They would see that it was evident, at the time the arrangement was formed, it was influenced wholly by the Treaty, and that the admirals must have concluded that they had received sufficient instructions to negociate in the only way in which men of their profession could negociate between contending parties. It was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0209"/>
<col>403</col>
impossible to conclude otherwise, and he was therefore convinced&#x2014;he thought every man in the House must be convinced&#x2014;that sir E. Codrington was fully authorized in doing what he had done, and in believing that the only effectual way of carrying into effect the Treaty of London, and of compelling the cessation of hostilities, was that to which he had resorted. If, then, he should convince the House that the admiral was authorized (without insisting that he was positively instructed) to act in a contemplated emergency as his judgment should direct, he should cut away from under the feet of the right hon. gentleman who spoke last the argument oh which he had relied. As to the observation, that we were not at war with the Turks, that he held to be quite inconclusive as to the present question. The true question here was, not whether we were actually at war, but whether an officer of signal skill, of extraordinary valour, and who had achieved a most splendid success, should be rewarded with the thanks which he had entitled himself to. This officer was not in the same situation as those who were engaged in the attack upon Copenhagen. Would the right hon. gentleman, whose mind was better qualified to study principles than to be bound by precedents, say, that the same public object was contemplated in that attack, and in the hostilities which were now under discussion? He did not attempt to deny that the naval services displayed in the attack on Copenhagen were as great, that the officers were as brave and as skilful as at Navarino. But, admitting all this, it formed no reasonable opposition to the present vote. It was beside the mark to inquire, whether we were in a state of actual warfare with the Turks; or whether we were in that state which jurists call a <i>bellum imperfectum;</i> or whether we were called upon by circumstances to exercise a species of magistracy which was known to the law of nations, and which was perfectly just in its principle, and humane in its object. It had been said, indeed, that the attack upon Copenhagen was justifiable, because Denmark had declared war against England. War was declared, it was true; but it was after the attack. It was after we had claimed of that country the surrender of its navy&#x2014;a demand which was justified upon the same principle as that which would justify one in taking out of the hands of a child a weapon that
<col>404</col>
might be turned against one's self. For this reason, the declaration of war, by Denmark, whether made before or after the attack, made no difference; for this was made upon grounds of mere self-defence, to prevent the possibility of our being injured by the means of which that country was in possession. There could be no doubt that according to the dictates of natural justice, and consistently with the doctrines of national law, any country had a right to provide for its safety, by preventing any possible attack from whoever and whatever had the means of endangering it. The only question that arose respecting Copenhagen was, whether the danger actually existed. In other times, it had been the custom to publish declarations of war by heralds; but now of what consequence was it whether a herald did or did not parade from Charing-cross to Temple-bar, and there proclaim that twenty-four hours afterwards war would commence, and letters of marque be issued to privateers and so forth? Would it be, at the best, any other than a ridiculous formality? The custom of the present day differed from that of former times. We declared war no longer by heralds, but by ambassadors. When danger existed, war was justified, and was begun. Upon this principle hostilities had been commenced against Denmark. Upon the same principle the hostilities which had been practised against the Turkish fleet were justified, if they had been begun for the purpose of effecting that armed mediation which the Treaty of London had recognized, and which, in his opinion, and in opposition to that of the right hon. gentleman, he maintained was perfectly just.&#x2014;But the hon. member for Dorsetshire said that that treaty was not to be enforced by war. He might as well say it was not to be enforced at all. By what other means could it be enforced? What but the strong hand of power&#x2014;such power as could be immediately felt, and the effects of which followed its first operation&#x2014;could be opposed to that war of extermination, as sir E. Codrington very properly called it, which our "ancient" allies the Turks carried on against the Greeks? And how could that power be exerted in a way more gallant, or more just, than it had been by that distinguished commander? He was astonished to hear a person of the right hon. gentleman's mind refer to the victory of Toulouse, and compare it to that of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0210"/>
<col>405</col>
Navarino. He would appeal from his ear to his intellect, from his voice to his understanding. If he thought there was no object in die armistice which by the treaty it was arranged should be enforced between the Turks and the Greeks, then indeed his comparison might be understood; but if he deemed it justifiable to do acts which necessarily led to the employment of arms under that treaty of the 6th of July, which, as a responsible minister of the Crown, he had advised the king to ratify, then it was impossible to establish any similarity between the battle of Navarino and that of Toulouse. The latter engagement took place in utter ignorance, by both of the contending parties, that peace had been concluded between the king of England and Louis 18th. He could not sufficiently express his astonishment, that knowing these facts, being perfectly cognizant of all the circumstances attending both the events to which he had referred, the right hon. gentleman should have confounded that accidental conflict which had no object in view, with one which had been undertaken with the most just and reasonable instructions, and which had been distinguished by the valour, skill, and success of those who had been intrusted with the conduct of it. It was the first time since the practice of thanking officers had prevailed, that the king of England had opened parliament with a speech deploring such a victory. It was the first time that the House of Commons had ever hesitated, had ever thought of doubting, whether they should thank men who had achieved so signal, so honourable, so important a victory. It would be the first time that ministers, who, by the contradiction between their language on a former occasion, and their resistance to the present vote, would give the nation and the world to suppose that their opinions were hostile to the treaty which they were pledged to execute. He would not say that where a matter was doubtful it was not expedient, in some cases, to hesitate before a full concurrence in its results should be yielded. There might be circumstances in which statesmen would be compelled to act differently from the ordinary principles of municipal law; the interests of a nation were sometimes at variance with the ordinary principles that regulated ordinary transactions; but there were no circumstances that could justify statesmen, who had volunteered certain opinions, in expressing
<col>406</col>
doubts as to the justice of a treaty which they had pledged themselves and the nation to carry into effect. He did not call upon the House to pass any judgment at this moment upon the Treaty of the 6th of July. That, he admitted, would require some evidence and some investigation; but as to the propriety of voting thanks to sir E. Codrington, neither the one nor the other were necessary. He begged the attention of the House to this&#x2014;that to refuse their thanks to one of the most meritorious officers that the service of the country could boast, would be to condemn the treaty unheard. By granting these thanks, they did not express their approval of the treaty; but they would feel that to give thanks for such services was the common and universal rule, and that to with hold them in this case would be to set up an exception to that rule. No attempt had ever been made to withhold thanks, in cases which could justly be called similar to this. To depart from the common course would be to do away with all the merit of the treaty, and at once, if not to condemn it, at least to hang it up as doubtful. It was to do more; it was to confess, in the face of all Europe that they were ashamed of having gained a victory. He would not enter, at present, into an inquiry as to the learning of the Reis Effendi, of whom he knew nothing, nor of any other of the members of the council of the Grand Seignor, whom he nevertheless did not doubt were very respectable people. He imagined, however, it would be understood, that the acts of the king of England at least were perfectly right. This depended upon principles which it could not be difficult to explain, even to a Reis Effendi. The king of England, then, had given the highest marks of his approbation to sir E. Codrington and the gallant officers who had served with him, by bestowing upon them all some reward or promotion. How would the right hon. gentleman justify his own conduct, who, after having advised his majesty to this step, now disputed the propriety of the House voting their thanks to the officers whom he had recommended to preferment? All the objections which he had made this evening were, at least, just as applicable on the occasion to which he (sir J. M.) alluded; and yet, after having then concurred in the measure of bestowing the red riband, or order, on sir E. Codrington, he now re-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0211"/>
<col>407</col>
fused the thanks, which on grounds wholly independent of the political merit of the treaty, he (sir J. M.) claimed for the same gallant officer. Did any body say to his majesty, that the principles of the British nation would not permit us to reward a meritorious officer who had carried into effect the directions of a treaty founded on justice and humanity, because there had been no formal declaration of war? He apprehended that no such objections had been made; otherwise, among the many reasons which had been given for certain recent resignations which had been much talked of, this would have filled a prominent place. No longer ago, indeed, than yesterday while ministers were concerting the opposition which they should to-day offer to the present question&#x2014;while they were concocting the scholastic and specious arguments which they now submitted to the House, his majesty's more powerful and generous mind had bestowed upon one of the officers engaged in the battle of Navarino, captain Fellowes, a distinguished mark of his approbation. The House of Commons alone was able to convey to the bosom of the admiral and his companions the thanks of the people of England; and this was all that was wanting to complete those testimonies to their valour and good conduct which they had so amply deserved. He was at a loss to understand the true grounds upon which this was to be withheld. It was said, that by so doing we might offend the Turks&#x2014;that it might be an impediment in the way of negotiation. Even if there were any weight (which he denied) in these objections, they were not sufficient; because, however injurious it might be to give the thanks which were required, it would be infinitely more so to the honour of this country to withhold it. It was a point of national honour, a paramount duty, to teach the jurists of Constantinople, that we had a right, and that we would execute it unchecked, of expressing our approbation of officers whom we thought had deserved it. What said the king of France as to the battle of Navarino? He called it no collision, he did not think it was an untoward event. He called it "the glorious battle of Navarino;" said it added to the glory of the French arms; and hailed it as a happy proof of the cordiality which existed among the allied forces, and believed that it would tend much towards the pacification of the east of Europe. And yet, after this, after
<col>408</col>
these testimonies at home and abroad, we hesitated, whether, for such exertions, we should thank the gallant officers by whom they had been made, and proclaim to all the world our doubts of the justice of the treaty, and of the merit of the admiral&#x0021;&#x2014;Before he closed, he wished to call the attention of the House to the conduct of the emperor of Russia. He wrote immediately to sir E. Codrington, and congratulated him on a victory, which he said had conferred the greatest honour on the civilized world; and that it was not only a triumph of the principles of morality, humanity, and justice, but achieved with admirable valour and skill. The disinterestedness of the sympathy which was evinced by the allies, in favour of the Greek Christians, was honourable in itself, and was so fraught with ingredients, of the greatest importance to Europe, that if they could now be gone into, they would silence the greater part of the objections that could be brought against the treaty. The event had been considered by the emperor of Russia as one highly honourable to this country and to its arms. For his own part, he believed that the peace of Europe depended mainly on the effect of the treaty, and the measures that were connected with it; and he could not sufficiently deprecate the attempts which, under the pretence of nibbling at the victory, struck at the root of that treaty. By their refusal the ministers only showed that they bore unwillingly, and because they were forced, the burthen of that engagement, which their predecessors had imposed upon them. The effect of that treaty was too clear, however, to admit of cavil or mistake. The question was not if it should be executed by peace or by war, because it was clear that it must be executed&#x2014;by peace if possible; by war if necessary. He deprecated war as much as any man could do; but as far as his information and reflection had enabled him to form an opinion, he must say, that a strenuous resistance to the power of Turkey was the only means of preventing dissatisfaction amongst the allied powers, and that any manifestation of weakness, or feebleness, or distrust, in the justice of the treaty or in the merit of the officers by whom it had been carried into execution, would be the probable cause of a general war throughout Europe. That treaty he took to be the key-stone on which the safety of Europe depended, and to which no approach
<image src="S2V0018P0I0212"/>
<col>409</col>
could be made without endangering the general safety. Let them observe how exactly true his observation was: there were not alone three parties to this treaty, for Austria (notwithstanding whatever secret machinations she had in concert with Russia), in a public pledge, given by baron Ottenfells in his note to the Porte last December, referred to the means of interference resorted to by the three contracting parties, and might thereby be said to have involved herself with them in the same line of policy. Heaven grant that, in the event of the principle linked to the present motion being disregarded, no reaction may take place in the affairs of the East&#x0021; There was nothing so important at this crisis, as to avoid every step which might tend to re-animate the blind, the senseless, the remorseless opposition of the Turks&#x2014;every thing which was calculated to revive their unhappy spirit of rushing on to their own destruction, in recklessly pursuing a horrid and murderous war, waged, as captain Hamilton expressively described it, against defenceless women and children, with the superadded aggravation of the burning of villages, the rooting up of trees, the destruction, not only of the works of art, but of the very productions of nature herself, as well as those of men. Captain Hamilton described, that he could trace the progress of the Turkish army by the smoke of the villages which they consumed and reduced to ashes in their line of march.&#x2014;He had listened with much attention to what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman opposite but still remained unshaken in favour of this motion. But when he considered the strong and full avowal of the government of their perfect intention to carry the treaty of July into effect&#x2014;not coldly, faintly, and literally, but honestly, honourably, and warmly,&#x2014;he owned he felt a strong disposition not to press this matter forward by a motion of which he nevertheless approved. His hon. friend (Mr. Hob-house) was, of course, master of his own motion, and knew best how to dispose of it; but he confessed he felt a strong desire to suggest to him the delicacy of any further proceeding, considering the way in which the gallant admiral might be placed by any misconstruction of the result. He was sure his hon. friend must feel that strongly; and more particularly as the gallant admiral was at a distance, and might be disposed, instead of having
<col>410</col>
had, as was on both sides admitted, a full acquittal, to feel some pang at the previous question being carried by a large majority, upon the proposition of a vote of thanks for his achievement. He had no fear of any thing else than a misconstruction; and as he wished to have some share in guarding a brave man's susceptibility of feeling from the least liability to pain, he should feel reluctance in pressing this motion to a division. While he said this, he wished to be understood as saying, that this discussion had been useful; for it had brought out these strong assertions of the intended perfect fulfilment of the treaty. This consideration he submitted to the better judgment of his hon. friend, and begged pardon of the House for having so long trespassed upon their attention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00308"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that differing so entirely as he did from the views entertained upon this subject by the hon. mover and the right hon. gentleman who spoke last, respecting either the principles upon which this motion was founded, or the impression to be apprehended from giving to it a qualified negative&#x2014;differing so far from them in opinion upon these points, yet he cordially concurred in the propriety of the right hon. gentleman's concluding recommendation, as the best mode of disposing of such a motion, with delicacy to the gallant individuals to whom it referred, and proper consideration for all the circumstances of the case. In rising to address the House on this occasion, he could assure them, that he wished most studiously to avoid every expression which could, in the slightest degree, tend to interpose any obstacle to the carrying of that recommendation into effect. Had he been called upon to argue this question in detail, he assured the hon. gentleman opposite, that he should have been disposed steadily to adhere to that prudent and judicious course which they had described; namely, of considering this subject abstractedly from the question of the policy or justice of the treaty itself. It was not, he knew, expedient to mix up together subjects which were so disconnected; and he admitted that it was better to consider how far this vote could be asked for, consistently with the usage of parliament, or whether a refusal of it could be supposed to imply a withdrawal of praise from the gallant admiral who had so bravely commanded at Navarino. He was sure his hon. friend, the member for Dorsetshire,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0213"/>
<col>411</col>
would not consider him deficient in that public and private respect which he so unfeignedly bore towards him, if, on the present occasion, he declined following him, in the larger consideration of the protocol, and the treaty which had arisen out of it. In alluding to these topics, he wished to say&#x2014;lest a total silence might be supposed to convey an equivocal impression&#x2014;that he had no hesitation to state, that he had no duty, as a minister of the Crown, which did not prompt him unhesitatingly to avow, that he was prepared to concur in the strictest execution of the treaty of July. His majesty having pledged his faith to its due fulfilment, he (Mr. Peel) was prepared to see it strictly redeemed. In adhering to that treaty, there were three great objects confessedly to be kept in view&#x2014;the termination of the contest between the actually contending parties, its termination upon a basis fixing the future regulation of these states, and the maintenance of the security and repose of Europe, on the accepted basis of the general treaty of peace, which had happily provided for that tranquillity. Under the circumstances in which this country was placed, he thought these declarations in the treaty of July were prudent and wise; and being so, it was hardly necessary for him to add, that their provisions ought to be honestly executed. He was, then, prepared to argue the subject precisely on the grounds described by the hon. gentleman opposite. If the hon. mover could show that upon which, indeed, his whole argument was founded, then he (Mr. Peel) would at once coincide with him in the conclusions to which he had arrived. The hon. member's whole argument was founded on this&#x2014;that this was the first instance in which, under similar circumstances, a vote of thanks had been denied by parliament. Now, he at once denied that proposition; nay, he would go further, and say, that if this motion were granted, it would be the first time that the thanks of parliament had been granted under such circumstances. He begged, at the outset, to disclaim that the government had the least intention to question the naval skill and valour which had distinguished the conduct of the officers engaged in the late action. He did not, therefore, withdraw his approval of the hon. member's motion, upon the least doubt of the skill and valour of the naval commanders, and the brilliancy of their achievement; but simply,

because it was in direct contravention of parliamentary usage, and, what was more important still, because it was contrary to the principle on which parliament were accustomed to give thanks for great victories.&#x2014;He would endeavour to follow, as closely as he could, the line of argument pursued by the hon. gentleman opposite. They had said, that ever since it was the practice of parliament to vote thanks for brilliant achievements, there was not a single instance in which a great naval action had been overlooked, or that the question of the declaration of war, as connected with the exploit, had been deemed of the slightest importance. The hon. mover had, it was true, touched lightly upon what he called the occurrence of sir George Byng's case in the year 1718; for he knew well enough how weak his point was upon that example. But, said the hon. member, it was not usual at that time to vote thanks for naval victories, because, in fact, these actions were then extremely rare. It was really singular that both the hon. gentlemen opposite should be so incorrect upon a matter of history. It was not the fact, that thanks were not then usual for naval victories, or that they were of such rare occurrence. Not very long before sir George Byng's action, there were many instances of these victories. In 1692, admiral Russell was thanked for a victory which he gained in the summer of that year. In 1702, the duke of Ormond and sir George Rooke (who were together on foreign service) received the thanks of parliament for their naval action. The next great victory obtained at sea was certainly by sir George Byng over the fleet of Spain on the coast of Sicily; but mark the circumstances under which that victory was obtained. England was then acting in pursuance of the stipulations of the Treaty of Utrecht, and of the arrangements made for the security of the German empire. In the year 1716, this country had undertaken to guarantee the neutrality of Italy; and at this time Sicily was threatened by Spain though in peace. England sent at first, he believed, twenty sail of the line to the coast of Spain, to give notice to cardinal Alberoni, that she would interfere to prevent any aggression of Spain upon Sicily. Admiral Byng received for answer, from the court of Madrid, that he might execute his orders if he pleased, but that the king of Spain protested against the justice of his interference. Admiral Byng (and here the

<col>413</col>
coincidence was very striking) sailed after the Spanish fleet to the Sicilian coast, and insisted upon an armistice. The Spaniards refused; he attacked them and gained a signal victory over the fleet of the king of Spain. In this attack the admiral had acted in exact accordance with his instructions, and his conduct was entirely approved of by George 1st, who wrote him a letter with his own hand; the emperor of Germany did the same, and, in transmitting his entire approval of his conduct, added another mark of his approbation. In parliament, not a question had been raised as to the policy of his conduct; nevertheless, in that instance, no thanks were voted. There was, indeed, a question attempted to be raised at the opening of the then parliament&#x2014;not (as he had heard insinuated) by the Tories, the high Tories, but by the Whig opposition of those times. The address was opposed by Mr. Robert Walpole, sir J. JekyI, Mr. Spencer Cooper, and other men of similar politics; but, notwithstanding the signal failure of their attempt to oppose the address to the throne, the government never thought proper to propose the thanks of parliament to admiral Byng? And why? Simply because England was not then at war with Spain: there had been no declaration of war between the two countries; so that this very case utterly destroyed the kind of assumption which had been built Upon it. If Byng's case was not in point, was, he would ask, the battle of Toulouse in point? Thanks were not voted for that battle, though fought with so much brilliancy and such complete success. Not because the government and the parliament did not then feel the highest admiration for the duke of Wellington's victory; but because this country was not at that identical time in a state of war with the restored government of France. It was the same in the case of Spain with admiral Byng; and it was exactly the same in the present case with the Ottoman Porte.&#x2014;But the hon. gentlemen opposite had said, this case of Navarino is peculiarly entitled to the thanks of parliament, because the Crown has already interfered to mark its admiration of the valour and skill of the admiral, by conferring upon him honours, and it follows that parliament ought to do the same. Why, the Crown took exactly a similar course after the battle of Toulouse, and yet parliament never voted thanks for that event. The Crown conferred medals
<col>414</col>
upon the officers, as a mark of the grateful acknowledgment of the sovereign for the signal valour they had shown on the occasion, and on these medals was inscribed the name of the particular victory. With respect to Copenhagen, in which the hon. member professed himself unable to find a shadow of difference, he (Mr. Peel) saw a palpable distinction. Why, in the case of Copenhagen that very fact existed, the non-existence of which was the reason of the forbearance from voting parliamentary thanks in the cases of admiral Byng and the battle of Toulouse&#x2014;there was a declaration of war issued by Denmark against Great Britain. At the time of the military occupation of the Danish arsenals, Denmark declared herself at war with England; and that war raged when the thanks of parliament were voted for the victory in the Sound. It was astonishing that the right hon. gentleman's (sir J. Mackintosh's) acuteness did not point out to him the great difference between the two cases. When the occupation of Denmark occurred, war was declared against England; when the thanks were voted that war continued; when the attack took place at Navarino, England was at peace with Turkey; she was still in peace with the Ottoman power; and it was at such a time that a vote of thanks was asked for a victory gained over her fleet.&#x2014;There was, then, this obvious distinction between the two cases&#x2014;in the one, there was a declaration of war, in the other, there was nothing but peace. Independent of these strong considerations, there was this difference&#x2014;the object of the attack on Copenhagen was entirely different from that at Navarino. In the former, the object was the seizure of the Danish fleet; in the other, the object was not the seizure, nor the destruction of the Turkish armament. And to show this he would found an argument entirely upon sir E. Codrington's own account of the matter. From the terms of that gallant officer's despatch, he would show, that it was impossible to vote the thanks in the form now called for; conceding as he willingly did, at the same time, his greatest praise for the admiral's skill and valour in the action. At Copenhagen there was a seizure, and a bringing away, of the Danish fleet. At Navarino not a single ship was seized or brought away. At Copenhagen the application was made to the supreme power of the state.&#x2014;At Navarino only to the officers of the Porte, who had
<image src="S2V0018P0I0215"/>
<col>415</col>
not the means of immediately communicating with the heads of their government. Surely, then, there was a plain and obvious distinction between the two cases.&#x2014;Turning to the gallant admiral's despatch, and overlooking those considerations of sympathy for Greece, and prophetic apprehensions of re-action in Turkey, to which-allusion had been made, he would, he repeated, found another argument. Before he did so, however, he was anxious to allude to an insinuation which had crept into this discussion, as if there was any thing connected with the late changes in his majesty's government, that had had any tendency to withhold from the admiral on this occasion the fair need to which he was entitled. To such an insinuation he gave the most positive disclaimer. Indeed, the right hon. gentleman, who spoke last, who was himself connected with the government, ought to have been the last to have thrown out such an insinuation; for his right hon. friend (Mr. Tierney) the late master of the Mint, could, as one of his majesty's ministers at the time alluded to, have removed all doubt upon that point. If that right hon. gentleman felt that deep interest which, as a member of the late government, he ought to feel, were the intentions of his colleagues frustrated by subsequent ministerial arrangements, he would, in the present debate, have, instead of being absent, sat at the side of his right hon. friend who had last spoken, and supported his opinions and conclusions. From that right hon. gentleman's absence, he necessarily inferred that this never had been a question with the late government.&#x2014;Reverting to the allusion to the admiral's despatch, he there found that gallant officer's own account of his intentions and mode of proceeding. Sir E. Codrington had transmitted the protocol of what took place in conjunction with the two other admirals, two days before the battle. In that protocol the admirals state, "that there only remains to the commanders of the allied squadrons, the choice between three modes of fulfilling the intentions of their respective courts." And they then described the three; namely, the blockade, the securing by their permanent presence the inaction of the Turkish fleet, and the taking up a position in Navarino; and they finally adopt the last as the least likely to be vexatious, and at the same time to be efficacious. It was thus stated in the protocol;&#x2014;" The proceeding to take a position
<col>416</col>
with the squadrons in Navarino, in order to renew to Ibrahim propositions, which, entering into the spirit of the treaty, were evidently to the advantage of the Porte itself;" and they add, "that they have unanimously agreed that this third mode may, without effusion of blood, and without hostilities, but simply by the imposing presence of the sovereigns, produce a determination leading to the desired object." This was their view of the state of things; and he agreed with them that they had a right to found upon it all reasonable presumptions of a pacific result. Accident had, however, determined it otherwise, by the collision which had so unfortunately followed, and into the origin of which he would not, at that moment, more particularly inquire; and respecting which, he hoped he might be permitted to mix up with his highest admiration of the gallantry and skill of the admirals, his deepest regret at the occurrence of so lamentable an accident&#x2014;so "untoward "an event, to use the description which had been so much complained of in the King's speech. It had been said, with reference to this description, that the king of France had not resorted to words of that import, but had described the action as having been merely "unforeseen;" which the government of this country, without the slightest intention of imputing blame to the British admiral, had called an "untoward event." Now, let the House hear what was the description given of the occurrence by the admiral himself. Why, he had characterised it as "a disastrous extremity." His words are&#x2014;" But it was my duty to refrain, and refrain I did; and I can assure his royal highness, that I would still have avoided this disastrous extremity, if other means had been open to me." In another part, he said, in allusion to the commander of the Egyptian ships, he sent a message that "he would not fire at all." Was not that conclusive proof that the admirals did not contemplate general hostilities in their efforts to pursue the objects of the treaty. Then, again, as expressive of the admiral's meaning and object, was the following message, which he sent to the Turkish authorities, on the next day after the battle:&#x2014;" As the squadrons of the allied powers did not enter Navarino with an hostile intention, but only to renew to the commanders of the Turkish fleet propositions which were to the advantage of the Grand Seignor himself, it is not our inten-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0216"/>
<col>417</col>
tion to destroy what ships of the Ottoman navy may yet remain, now that so signal a vengeance has been taken for the first cannon-shot which has been ventured to be fired on the allied flags." And he afterwards proceeded to say, that if the Turks abstain from committing any act of hostility, "We shall resume those terms of good understanding which they have themselves interrupted." Could any terms have been employed more descriptive of the fact that this action had arisen from a casualty, and was not to be characterised, with whatever skill and valour the exploit had been conducted, as a warlike proceeding? Why, then, hesitate to mix up with their praise of the heroism of individuals, that kind of regret which ought to accompany such an action, and divest it of that attribute of war which alone could sustain the present motion? There was an authority to which he might refer upon the present occasion, and towards which he was persuaded the House would feel the strongest; sentiments of respect. He alluded to the late Mr. Windham, who, in speaking of the Copenhagen expedition, had expressed himself, in a speech, which, if not strictly applicable in all its principles to the question before the House, was, nevertheless, in its general spirit, and in many of its points and principles, capable of affording a just view, without reflecting in the slightest degree upon the conduct of the gallant officer. Mr. Windham had expressed his regret at the part which he felt himself bound to take, because there was an idea that where praise was withheld, blame was intended to be cast. But nothing could be further from his intention than to visit with the slightest reproach or indifference the conduct of the gallant men who were engaged. On the contrary, he subscribed most cheerfully to all that had been said in favour of the navy and army; they had acquitted themselves to the admiration of all, not merely by doing their duty, but by displaying that humanity for which they were equally remarkable in mitigating the horrors of war. But still it was necessary that their conduct should be kept distinct from the nature and character of the service in which they were employed, and from the conduct of his majesty's ministers who were responsible for that service. Mr. Windham had said, and truly said, that actions of that description were not selected by nations for rejoicing. It was upon that principle that he felt pain
<col>418</col>
at hearing the Tower guns fire, when a feeling at least of common sympathy might be expected from the mouths and hearts of those who contemplated the loss of human life, and the extent of human suffering. It was upon these principles, laid down by a man who was as much alive to the military and naval glory of his country, as any member of that House, that he was prepared to justify the expression of regret; and the more so, as that expression implied in it no imputation against the conduct of sir E. Codrington, or those who acted under his command. Such were the principles avowed by a man who was so careful of the fame of naval and military men, that even in the case of a single frigate, commanded by sir E. Pellew, he had manifested his anxiety, that it should not pass without distinction, measuring that distinction, not by the extent, but by the nature of the service,&#x2014;For the reasons he had already stated, he could reconcile his mind to the part which his majesty's government had acted; satisfied as he was, that no inference could be drawn from thence to the injury of sir E. Codrington. In fact, the present was not an occasion which it was customary to signalize by a vote of thanks; and it would be injurious to establish such a precedent as that of voting the thanks of parliament, without reference to the nature of the service for which they were awarded. It would be a departure from the practice of parliament, to regard valour, however signal, and skill, however unquestionable and undisputed, as constituting in themselves a sufficient title to the distinction. He admired the skill and bravery displayed, as much as any man; and if, in conformity with the practice of the House, he could agree to the motion of the hon. gentleman, he would most willingly have done so. God knew he did not oppose the motion upon private grounds&#x0021; He acknowledged the merits of sir E. Codrington; but the hon. gentleman was bound to acknowledge to him, on the other hand, that it was not customary to vote the thanks of the House, under the circumstances in which they were called for that night. The hon. gentleman, in the progress of his speech, had objected to the introduction of the term, "ancient ally," which ha seemed to think that Turkey herself would be disposed to disclaim, as altogether inapplicable to our former relations with that power. He even seemed to infer, that some peculiar
<image src="S2V0018P0I0217"/>
<col>419</col>
favour was intended to be paid to Turkey at the expense of Russia. As to the probability of Turkey declining the epithet, he must say, that it did not strike him to be very clearly made out when he looked to some of the state documents which had passed between the Porte and this country in the reign of queen Elizabeth. He had not brought those papers with him for the purpose of making extracts, but he could assure the House, that so far from betraying any coldness of style, they were lavish in the use of those magnificent and high-toned compliments for which the inhabitants of the east have been always remarkable. Again, after the restoration of Charles 2nd, when, as the House knew, the knowledge of the Turks in geography was not very far advanced, the same spirit pervaded their style, and the opinion that England had been a dependency of France was put forward as an apology for some differences which had taken place, but were reconciled. To deny that the Turks were our ancient allies, seemed to be rather a fastidious nicety, after the lapse of three hundred years, during which we had been concerned with them in the interchange of treaties of amity, and after having preserved with them those relations, from the year 1589, when they first commenced, down to the present period, with only the temporary interruptions which took place in 1799 and 1806. It was assuming rather too much to say, that they would fling back the expressions alluded to, when in the Treaty of Amiens, a treaty so remarkable for its importance, the Ottoman Porte adopted the language which described England as her ally: when, in the treaty of 1799, the good understanding which had always existed between the courts and the Sublime Porte was distinctly stated on the part of Turkey, and the propriety of renewing their ancient friendship admitted by the contracting parties. Was it not, then, a quarrel upon words alone, to dispute the use of the term "ancient ally;" when we had always been in the habit of calling her our ancient friend.? But, what were the terms in which Mr. Canning-spoke of the Turkish government&#x2014;and that, not when he was addressing the government of Turkey, or could be suspected of using terms for the purpose of conciliating that power, but when he was addressing another party, with whom they could not be expected to communicate. The document to which he alluded was a letter
<col>420</col>
addressed by Mr. Canning to Mr. Rodio, the agent of the Greek government, in answer to an application for assistance. That letter, which was dated the 1st of September, 1824, stated that, connected as England had been with the Ottoman Porte by ancient obligations and treaties, which the Porte had not violated, England could not surely be expected to engage in a war against her. Let it not be supposed for a moment, that the words objected to in the king's speech had been used with a lurking desire to cast a reflection on the conduct of sir E. Codrington, and the other gallant officers and men who were engaged at Navarino. Nothing could be further from the fact. Neither let it be supposed, that they were not prepared to fulfil to the utmost those engagements to which the faith of the country was pledged. His majesty's government were as willing as those who might be inclined to support the motion of the hon. gentleman, to do justice to the gallantry of all who were engaged in the late affair; and therefore he was not without a hope that the hon. mover, instead of pressing the question to a division, would adopt the suggestion of his right hon. and learned friend, and take that course which would, under all the circumstances of the case, be most satisfactory to the feelings of the gallant officer, most agreeable to the consistency of parliament, and, as he believed, to the wishes of the country at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00309"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, that, after the liberal speech which had fallen from the right hon. gentleman, he had very little to say; and he had no doubt that it would be the means of prompting his hon. colleague, who, he was sure, felt the same candour that the right hon. gentleman had expressed, to come to the conclusion which would be most satisfactory to the House, and to his gallant friends, whose characters he had so ably vindicated. It appeared to be admitted on all hands, that sir E. Codrington had performed the service on which he had been engaged, and under whatever circumstances it might have been imposed upon him, in a way that redounded highly to his character&#x2014;in a way too, he might add, which was calculated, in a very eminent degree, to exalt the naval character of the country and to reflect honour on himself. It was not, however, his intention to take up the time of the House, by repeating those panegyrics which had already been bestowed
<image src="S2V0018P0I0218"/>
<col>421</col>
by so many members; but when he considered the difficult situation in which the gallant admiral had been placed&#x2014;when he considered the heavy responsibility which attached to the conduct he had that day adopted&#x2014;when he considered not only the valour, but the eminent discretion and prudence, which he had evinced, he thought it impossible for the House not to agree&#x2014;as, indeed, he might say, it had agreed&#x2014;that no military or naval commander had ever executed a service under more trying: circumstances, or had ever come out of the difficulties of his situation with more claim to praise. He regarded it as one of not the least fortunate circumstances of the affair, that that day had been the means of placing the names of the greatest states in Europe side by side in alliance, and had thus made the gallant admiral the means of uniting the combined powers in a bond, founded on a reciprocity of interests, existing between Russia, France, and England; and he congratulated himself, as an English member of parliament, that it had been an admiral of his own country who had had the happiness of uniting in valour the admirals of the other allied powers; that it was under his guidance they had placed themselves, and united in a feeling even more splendid than that of victory. There had been between them an emulation, not only of glory, but of generosity; and while each had striven to outdo the other in deeds of bravery and brilliancy it appeared as if they had done so, less for the sake of individual praise than for general emulation&#x2014;not an emulation which founded its birth in envy, and which turned pale at the voice of approbation, but an emulation of great deeds, and of all those generous feelings which, displayed before the world, proved the union of the men, and that their great object was each other's success.&#x2014;Though there were one or two points on which he intended to have replied to the right hon. gentleman, he would not enter further upon any part of the subject, as he was content to leave it, as far as testimony was concerned, to the candour and fairness with which the right hon. gentleman had met it. He should therefore content himself with merely expressing his satisfaction at the justice which had been done to the naval officers who had commanded on that occasion; and though there was not room for a particular panegyric on all those persons who had distinguished themselves in the action,
<col>422</col>
yet, in the general applause which had fallen from every one who had spoken might be found the true feeling that was entertained of their conduct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00310"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> said, that after the attention which the House had already paid to what he had to say on the subject, he would not take up their time in reply. There was only one term in the right hon. gentleman's speech with which he had to quarrel, and it was that in which he charged him with not having shown his discretion in bringing forward this motion. If there was nothing else to prove the discretion of his having done so, he thought that the mere fact of its having elicited the general praise that it had done with respect to the conduct of sir E. Codring-ton, was sufficient evidence; and he thought that the gallant admiral might himself dwell with satisfaction on what had taken place in the House that night. It had been said, that there would have been no objection to the motion, if we had been at war, and these words certainly proved to him, that what had likewise been observed that night&#x2014;that the gallant admiral stood as high for valour and discretion as any man in his majesty's service&#x2014;was strictly true. Under these circumstances, and believing that the conduct of the gallant admiral needed no further explanation, he should consent to the withdrawing of the motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>FINANCE COMMITTEE.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00312"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;In rising on the present occasion, Sir, in pursuance of the notice which I have given, I shall take the liberty in the first place, to move the reading of that passage in his majesty's most gracious speech, at the commencement of the session, in which he recommends us to inquire into the state of the public Income and Expenditure.<lb/>
The clerk then read the following passage:&#x2014;
<quote>"We are commanded by his Majesty to recommend to your early attention, an inquiry into the state of the revenue and expenditure of the country.</quote>
<quote>"His Majesty is assured, that it will be satisfactory to you to learn, that, notwithstanding the diminution which has taken place in some branches of the Revenue
<image src="S2V0018P0I0219"/>
<col>423</col>
the total amount of receipts during the last year has not disappointed the expectations which were entertained at the commencement of it."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00313"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> resumed.&#x2014;Sir, I have moved that that part of his Majesty's Speech which refers to the state of the income and expenditure of the country should be read, not merely in compliance with the general usage which has prevailed upon the occasion of similar motions, but in order that I may introduce the proposition which I am about to make, under the highest auspices and claim for it the sanction and the recommendation of the first authority in the land. The proposition for the appointment of a finance committee is not a novel proposition. At various periods of the history of this country, committees have been appointed at the recommendation of the Crown, for the purpose of examining into the expenditure and the income of the country; and for the purpose also of submitting to this House their sentiments as to the possibility of establishing a more effectual control over that expenditure, and of making such reductions in its amount as may be deemed compatible with existing circumstances.<lb/>
In the year 1786, some short time after the termination of the American war, a finance committee was appointed on the recommendation of Mr. Pitt. After an interval of some years, again in 1796, a similar committee was appointed, over which the present lord Colchester presided; and presided with a degree of ability, which has conferred upon him the greatest honour; and of which committee, so presided over by him, the recommendations have realized to the country the greatest benefits. Sir, in the year 1807, I think upon the recommendation of the present marquis of Lansdowne, then lord Henry Petty, a committee was appointed, having for its object to make similar inquiries. Again in the year 1817, a fourth committee was moved for by the late lord Castlereagh; and that was the last of those committees of finance, which have been appointed by preceding parliaments. By an entirely fortuitous, but somewhat singular coincidence, the same period of time or very nearly the same period of time, has elapsed between the respective appointments of all these committees. The committee of 1786 was the first instance of such an appointment in modem times: in 1796, after, an interval of ten years,
<col>424</col>
another such committee was appointed; and in the early part of the year 1807, after the lapse of exactly a similar period, another. Then again in 1817, after another period of ten years, the fourth committee was nominated; and now, in 1828, accidentally no doubt, but again, after a similar interval, I have come forward, Sir, to propose the re-institution of the finance committee.<lb/>
Sir, I do not propose the appointment of this committee from any of the motives, or from any of the objects, which have, in the course of the casual conversations that have lately taken place in this House, been sometimes insinuated, as the motives or objects of such appointment. I assure the House, that I do not, for a moment, propose this committee in the reluctant fulfilment of a pledge given by a former government. I propose it, Sir, in the deep conviction which I have long entertained, and which has been confirmed by the examinations I have recently made, of documents intimately connected with this subject. I propose it, in the deliberate conviction, that the time has at length come, when we must look fully and fearlessly at the state of the finances of this country. I do not propose this committee with the object insinuated, of deluding and deceiving the people of this kingdom, and of either procuring from it recommendations for increased establishments, or of founding upon the recommendations of this committee any propositions for increased taxation. I propose this committee, because I believe it will fulfil the purposes for which it is to be ostensibly instituted, and because I believe if it shall honestly fulfil them, the executive government and the country at large, will derive the most important benefits from its appointment.<lb/>
It, perhaps, may be unnecessary for me, as it would certainly be much more agreeable to myself, if my labours were confined to a statement simply of the views, and to the proposal of the names of those, whose known acquirements point them out to the House as fit to be the members of this committee&#x2014;it, perhaps, may be unnecessary that I should much exceed a brief indication of these two topics. But I think I have inferred from conversations which have already taken place here, that a general expectation is entertained, that I should preface my proposal for the appointment of this committee, by some reference of a general nature to the finances of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0220"/>
<col>425</col>
country. I should be sorry to disappoint that general expectation; but, at the same time, I hope that in attempting to answer it in my address to them, they will bear with me, and extend to me their indulgent consideration. They will have the goodness to recollect, that statements of this kind have not been at all necessarily connected with the labours of that department which I have been more particularly connected with; and that, under the particular circumstances that have attended my recent return to office, I have been called on to give almost an undivided attention to other matters; and have really not had time to devote that degree of consideration to the subject which its extreme importance deserves; but which, had I been able so to do, might have compensated in some degree, for the disability and unaptness, which I fear will be perceptible in the statement I am about to offer.<lb/>
In deference, however, to this general expectation of the House, I will state, or endeavour to do so, not only my general view of the whole question of finance, but also an outline of the income and expenditure of the country, for some years preceding. If there be any merit in the statement, then, which I am about to make, it will consist in this only&#x2014;that I shall attempt to state the truth, without concealing or glossing over any thing. For, Sir, I am convinced, that nothing can be more fruitless, or more impolitic, than to introduce any thing like mistification, or suppression, into a view of the public finances of the empire. These matters are, I take it, much more simple than they appear to be on the face of ordinary official statements of them. There is, in fact, not the slightest difference between the calculations formed upon many millions and upon a few pounds, or between the expenditure of a humble individual and that of a rich and powerful country. They depend upon the same principles, and must be governed by the same laws; and one might as well contend that the rules of arithmetic, applying to the sums with which we ordinarily deal in the course of domestic occurrences&#x2014;that these rules do not apply to the division or the sub-division of many millions of money, as to suppose that the finances of the country, however great or important she may be, must not, after all, rest on the same principles, and be governed by the same rule, as the finances of an individual.<lb/>
<col>426</col>
I shall attempt then, Sir, to consider this important question, namely, the present state of the finances of this country, on precisely the same principles that any individual would apply to a view of his own concerns; supposing he found it necessary, for any purpose, to enter upon the consideration of them. I shall, therefore, as far as possible, divest my statement of all technicality&#x2014;of every thing tending to obscure it, or to make it unintelligible to those even who may be least versed in financial matters. Now, I presume, Sir, that if an individual were about to look into the state of his affairs, in order to ascertain what his circumstances really were&#x2014;what were his expenses, and what the probable prospective state of his finances to meet them, he would decide upon proceeding on these principles; first, he would attempt to determine what were the encumbrances to which he might be liable, and from which he could not escape; secondly, what had been the nett amount of his income, for some years past; thirdly, what the nett amount of his expenditure during the same period; and, fourthly, what reasonable prospect there might exist, either as to the future amount of his expenses or his income.<lb/>
In referring thus briefly to the matters which I shall submit to the House, I am merely about to state a few facts, which may enable the House to take a general view of the present financial condition of the country. The first question, then, to be propounded, according to the course which I have prescribed to myself, is&#x2014;what is the present amount of those encumbrances, of those pledges, to the fulfilment of which we are bound, by every obligation of national honour and national good faith. For, Sir, whatever may be the state of the finances of this country, or whatever our present difficulties, I believe there will be almost an universal hope, and an universal feeling and expectation, throughout the empire, that the national faith which has been pledged to the public creditor, must be, in the first instance, regarded as a bond, as an encumbrance, which must be satisfied, before any proceedings are adopted, with a view to reduce the expenses of the country. I think it will be quite sufficient for my purpose (although I will go as much further back as any gentleman may desire), if, taking the amount of the general debts, funded and unfunded, at a recent period,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0221"/>
<col>427</col>
I compare it with the amount of her debt in the first year after the late peace. Taking that, then, as the first, and shewing the utmost extent of our encumbrances at the end of the war, I shall take an intermediate period between that, year and the present; and then I shall state the amount of our obligations at this moment. For these purposes, then, I propose to take the years 1815, 1822, and 1827. Now, the year 1822, is a term pretty nearly intermediate between 1815 and 1828. I should premise that, in order to simplify my statement, and make it much clearer than it would otherwise be, I shall call that which is, in fact, the year 1815&#x2014;but which ends on the 5th January, 1816&#x2014;the year 1816, as being the more compendious, and the juster way of describing it, and so of other years that I may name. The total capital, then, of the unredeemed funded debt of this country, in the year ending on the 5th January, 1816, was 816,310,000<i>l.</i> In 1822, the total amount of the unredeemed debt was 796,530,000<i>l.</i> Last year, the amount or capital of the unredeemed debt was 777,476,000<i>l.</i> I should observe, that I deem it unnecessary to mention the hundreds. This last item is strictly, I believe, 3 or 400<i>l.</i> more, but I apprehend it is sufficient if I state it thus in round numbers. I conceive I shall simplify my statement by omitting to mention, and I think it probable the House will agree with me in considering the amount of the debt too large to render it necessary to be very particular in mentioning hundreds.<lb/>
The next matter to be considered is, the amount of charge. The amount of charge for debt to which the country is annually liable, includes the amount" of interest payable to the public creditor, on account of the funded debt; and the cost of management of the unfunded debt. This charge amounted,

But this statement alone does not comprise a fair view of the aggregate amount of the public debt, and the charge upon it. In the first place, the annuities payable on the public funds are terminable in point of fact; but at so distant a period as scarcely to warrant the introduction of any calculations founded on their expiration. In the next place, a portion of this
<col>428</col>
charge is permanent, and a portion temporary only. We are next to consider what has been the total amount of charge occasioned to the country by reason of the unredeemed funded debt, at the first period&#x2014;the year after the peace&#x2014;the intermediate period 1822&#x2014;and in the last year. I propose, therefore, to add to the charge of the unredeemed debt, the amount of the charge upon annuities; in order to show the total amount payable by the country, in consequence of the unredeemed debt and annuities taken together. The annual amount of charge on the funded debt and annuities was,

I am not yet come, Sir, to speak of the Exchequer bills or unfunded debt; but the statement I have made will serve to shew that the diminution of the public expenditure, on account of interest, to which this country is liable, was last year, as compared with the year 1815, 2,106,000<i>l.</i> but, as compared with 1822, only 216,000<i>l.</i><lb/>
I have been hitherto speaking of the funded debt. I now come to the unfunded debt. In order to determine this view of the whole of the encumbrances to which the country is liable, on account of the charge of the unfunded debt, including Exchequer bills (under various classes), public works, Irish Treasury, deficiency, and outstanding, I may state, that&#x2014;

The total annual charge, therefore, for these three years, namely, 1815, 1823, and 1827, as for funded debt, for annuities and for unfunded debt, was&#x2014;

I am perfectly aware that all this is matter of mere detail, and as such must be very tedious, I fear, to some hon. gentlemen around me; but, on account of the extreme importance of that detail, I must entreat their most serious attention to it. The total decrease, then, Sir, of the capital of the unredeemed funded debt, since the year 1815, has been 38,835,000<i>l.</i> that is to say, last year, as compared with the year 1815, we had appropriated for the redemption of the funded debt, 38,835,000<i>l.</i>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0222"/>
<col>429</col>
and in 1827 also, the unfunded debt, as compared with its amount in 1815, was decreased by 9,770,000<i>l.</i> so that the decrease upon the debt, funded and unfunded, was, in round numbers, 48,605,000<i>l.</i> The total decrease of charge on account of the funded and unfunded debt, since 1815, appears to have been 4,424,000<i>l.</i>; that is to say, a less amount on account of the charge for the total debt, as compared with its amount in the first year of peace, 1815, by the considerable sum of 4,424,000<i>l.</i><lb/>
It may not be unimportant, in the next place, to state what proportion of the annual charge, on the total debt of the country is occasioned by annuities. Of these annuities, some, as I have before observed, are terminable. In January, 1815, the total amount of charge on the debt was 30,488,000<i>l.</i>, of which 1,924,000<i>l.</i> was absorbed by annuities. In January, 1823, the total charge was 28,596,000<i>l.</i>, of which 1,892,000<i>l.</i> was the amount of annuities. Last year the total charge was 28,381,000<i>l.</i>, and the proportion of annuities (a proportion undoubtedly much increased) was 2,602,000<i>l.</i> My sole purpose is to give a full and unreserved statement of the condition of the finances of the country. I trust there will be no material error; for my object is to state all&#x2014;to conceal nothing.<lb/>
This being, then, the state of our encumbrances for which we have to provide, let us next look at what has been our Revenue and our Expenditure for some time past. In order to make a correct estimate for the future, the best course will be to extend the view somewhat beyond the limit of two or three years; and I propose, therefore, to bring "the period of five years within the scope of my observations. I will first state what has been the expenditure of the country for each of the last five years. And here, Sir, at the outset, I am met by a difficulty, as to the meaning of the word expenditure&#x2014;a difficulty which, obviously, must be solved, before we can hope to have a clear understanding upon the subject. I wish it, therefore, to be understood, that, by "expenditure," I mean the national expenses, clear of what is called the "Dead-weight"&#x2014;the naval and military pensions. For the sake of promoting a clear and intelligible view of this complicated question, I discard all consideration, for the present, of the sums of 4,800,000<i>l.</i> on the one side,
<col>430</col>
and the 2,800,000<i>l.</i> or whatever the amount is, on the other. That I may not be charged with a desire to evade a difficulty, I will afterwards speak of those pensions; but, for the present, I leave them altogether out of my calculation. I have, then, taken the last five years, and endeavoured to ascertain what has been the amount of the great branches of national expenditure, viz.&#x2014;the interest of the debt, the army, navy, ordnance, civil list establishments, and so on. It will be observed, that in stating the expenditure, I am stating it exclusive of the interest of the unfunded debt, and exclusive of the advance of five millions, given under the act of parliament, to the commissioners for the liquidation of the national debt. The expenditure, which I now propose to state to the House, comprises merely the ordinary expenditure of the country&#x2014;the great branches of expense. The total of these branches, then, exclusive of the sinking fund, was in&#x2014;

Suppose, in the next place, that we deduct from the gross expenditure, the fixed sum for the interest of the debt, in order to exhibit the expenditure apart from the fixed encumbrances. I proceed, then, to state the nett expenditure, exclusive of the charge for the funded and unfunded debt, exclusive of the naval and military pensions, and also for naval and military works&#x2014;which latter do not at all belong to the subject. The sums will then stand thus&#x2014;

In stating these figures correctly, Sir, I intend to cast no reflection upon any former government. In doing so, I should be reflecting upon myself, as well as upon them. I am satisfied that the course I am pursuing is the only one by which I can fairly present a full, financial, view of my subject; and it is to the accomplishment of that task that my duty upon the present occasion points.<lb/>
Having thus separated the ingredients of our expenditure&#x2014;having shewn it in. parts&#x2014;I will now present to the House a view of the total expenditure and income,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0223"/>
<col>431</col>
for the entire period of five years. The total income, including all sources of revenue, and the re-payment of advances made for public works, for the five years last past, is 261,000,000<i>l.</i> Of course, the House knows the meaning of re-payments of advances made upon public works in England and Ireland. Sums were advanced from time to time, for the promotion of works in both countries, security being taken for the interest and re-payment at convenient periods; and this sum of 261,000,000<i>l.</i> includes within it such sums as have been repaid during the five years.<lb/>
I will now, with equal unreserve, state the amount of the expenditure for the same period; so that, by deducting the one sum from the other, we may see what has been the real surplus of income over expenditure. I omit in this statement likewise, as in the statement of the income, the naval and military pensions, and include all advances made for public works, and, indeed, every other charge. The total of our expenditure, thus obtained, deducting the repayments, is 249,000,000<i>l.</i> Deducting 249,000,000<i>l.</i> from 261,000,000<i>l.</i> the total surplus revenue, applicable to the liquidation of the national debt, during that period of five years, appears to have been 12,000,000<i>l.</i><lb/>
Now, Sir, I will state the income and expenditure, including the Dead-weight, as it adds to the income on one side, and to the expenditure on the other, under the existing arrangement, with respect to that item. The total, then, inclusive of every payment for the last five years, will be&#x2014;

Making a total surplus of twenty-one millions in round numbers, according to this view of the subject.<lb/>
The next point to which I think it necessary to draw the attention of the House, is the amount paid by the commissioners of the Sinking-fund, as directed to be annually appropriated by act of parliament for the last five years. The total of these payments is 29,414,000<i>l.</i> Exhibiting an excess over the surplus income, which amounts, as I have shown, to 21,144,000<i>l.</i>, of 8,360,000<i>l.</i> The difference has been made up, partly by money raised for that purpose, and partly by reduction of the balances in the Exchequer on the last day of one year compared with those ba-
<col>432</col>
lances on the last day of another. Supposing, for instance, the amount of balances, to have been five millions in the year 1823, and the amount now to be only two millions, the House will easily see, that a larger sum by three millions than the actual surplus of the income over expenditure may have, during the intervening period been applied to the reduction of the debt.<lb/>
I am not aware, Sir, that I have omitted any point necessary to render to the House a clear, unembarrassed, and perfectly true, account of the income and expenditure of the last five years, and of the encumbrances for which we have had to provide. It would be difficult for me to attempt an estimate of the future probable revenue of the country. That is a task which more properly devolves on my right hon. friend, the chancellor of the Exchequer, at a more advanced period of the session; and it would be presumption in me to anticipate, with the feeble means which I have for coming to a judgment, the statement which we may expect from him. For the purpose, however, of assisting to furnish a correct view of our prospects in that respect, it may not be amiss to refer to the ordinary expenditure and income of the last two years. The total ordinary revenue

I am aware, Sir, that some expectation is entertained that I shall say something about the estimates for the present year; and, although they are not all made up in a form fit to present to the House, I shall not hesitate to give a general, and, I believe, an accurate, notion of their amount. I protest, however, against being responsible for any inaccuracy that may subsequently appear to attach to this statement. It is my anxious wish to give the House every possible information upon every branch of the subject; and it is that alone which induces me to make this premature disclosure of the probable amount of the Estimates of the present year.

Now, Sir, I hope I shall not be charged with concealment or intentional mis-statement, should any of the sums come out different from what I have stated. Sir, I state these items fairly and explicitly to the House, with a view of putting it in possession of the real state of the financial affairs of the country. I am sure the House will do me the justice to believe I am disposed to make no intentional error. Sure I am there is no wilful misrepresentation; and should any immaterial error hereafter appear, I am satisfied the House will not bind me down to any casual inaccuracy that may arise from my disposition to put them in possession of the fullest information. The total of these Estimates is, 17,575,000<i>l.</i><lb/>
I have referred to the estimate made by the Finance Committee of 1817, as adequate for the same services prospectively; and I find that their estimate for the services I have enumerated was 17,350,000<i>l.</i> Deducting this sum from the former, there remains as the excess of the estimate for the present year, over the estimate of the Finance Committee of 1817, 227,000<i>l.</i> The total amount of estimates voted for the last year was 18,745,000<i>l.</i>; so that the estimates for the present year are less than those for the past year by 1,168,000<i>l.</i> The hon. member for Montrose seems to doubt the accuracy of my statement. I am perfectly willing to be corrected if I am in error. I believe it will be found that these estimates are

In looking forward to the probable demands that, will be made on this country, I think, Sir, we should not omit to take into consideration the effect that will be produced by the termination of the contract with the Bank of England, with
<col>434</col>
reference to the naval and military pensions. If it should not be deemed advisable to renew that contract&#x2014;if it should be thought better to return to the old system, and meet the charge of our pensions&#x2014;it is clear that the result will be an addition to the present expenditure of the country. The contract with the Bank will, I believe, expire in July of the present year. The effect of the termination of the contract will be a diminution of income available for the general services of the year 1828, as compared with the amount received from the trustees of the Bank. For the year 1827, 913,240<i>l.</i> And for the general services of the year 1828, as compared with 1827, of 1,940,740<i>l.</i><lb/>
It does not appear to me necessary further to trespass on the patience of the House, by presenting them with any further details, to enable them to form a just opinion as to the real state of the country. It is not my intention to enter into any defence of the contract to which I have just alluded&#x2014;it would be quite beside my purpose to do so&#x2014;and I have merely introduced it to assist in forming an hypothesis of our probable future income. For the same purpose only have I referred to the estimates. They were prepared by a government with which I was not connected; but I have a strong conviction on my mind, that they were prepared with great care, earnestly and successfully to carry into effect every possible retrenchment. But on the subject of these estimates, I will say that I am satisfied there exists in the new members of the present government, as well as in those who belonged to the last administration, a sincere desire to see economy in the public expenditure carried to its utmost length. And if through the recommendation of the Finance committee, it should appear practicable to make some reduction in the expenditure of the next half-year, that I am confident will be cheerfully effected. With respect to the army estimates, it has been proposed that a further reduction should be made in our military force. To effect this, there are two modes&#x2014;the one by disbanding the regiments, and the other by reducing the number of men. In the former case, there would be a claim on the part of those reduced, to pensions. By reducing the number of men merely, no expense is entailed on the country. The reduction of the men also could be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0225"/>
<col>435</col>
immediately effected, and certainly if our military force will bear reduction at all, that is the way least open to objection. Already, in several departments, we have entered upon the business of reduction. I have had communications with my noble friend at the head of the Foreign Department, and he has informed me of the prospect that presents itself of his being able to make reductions in several diplomatic expenses; more especially, in some of the expenses accruing out of our relations with South America. It is the intention also of my noble friend to apply himself to our foreign ministerial establishments, with a view of effecting a redaction in them. Another item in the general expenditure, to which I will not advert at length, because the attention of the House will, in due time, be drawn to it by my right hon. friend (Mr. Huskisson)&#x2014;that part of the public charge which arises out of our colonial relations&#x2014;is under review, and it is hoped that some reduction may be made in it. It must be within the knowledge of every one, that the military establishments maintained in and for the colonies entail considerable expense upon Great Britain. From some of our colonies&#x2014;those which have no independent legislatures, but are subject to the immediate dominion of the Crown&#x2014;a revenue applicable to public purposes and necessities is already received, amounting to about a million a year. I am perfectly ready to enter into the consideration, whether the revenue of those colonies may not be made so applicable, as materially to lessen the expenses of the mother country on their account.<lb/>
Having, Sir, expressed my willingness, and the willingness of the noble and right honourable persons who act with me, to attend most anxiously and zealously to any suggestions which may proceed from the finance committee, it only remains for me to say a few words upon the intended constitution of that committee, and of the powers which are to be intrusted to it. With respect to the constitution of the committee, I hope I have taken a course which will give general satisfaction. Nothing can be more painful than to have the nomination of such a body; from the duty which it imposes of excluding therefrom a number of persons whose assistance would be, in the highest degree, valuable. To make a selection, however, was necessary; and I have endeavoured
<col>436</col>
to choose those persons whose talents are generally admitted, and whose attention has been longest directed to the consideration of financial subjects. I have endeavoured to select much of the knowledge and experience of the House, without reference to party; and I do feel considerable confidence, that my selected choice will meet with approbation. With respect to the powers of the committee, I am not prepared to say what ought to be their exact limits. I think my right hon. friend (Mr. Huskisson) was, the other night, materially misunderstood, when he was stated to have declared, that the establishments of the country were such as government only was responsible for, and that the committee would have no right to inquire into them. It is impossible for any man of good sense to think of prescribing the exact limits of such an inquiry. On the one hand, it is clear that the executive government, if it is to be competent to the discharge of its duties, must be responsible, to a certain extent, for the establishments of the country. On the other hand, to exclude the committee from all view of those establishments, would be as absurd as it would be to deny the responsibility of the government. Most of the circumstances connected with those establishments cannot be excluded from a body so appointed. But, at the same time, it is obvious, that government may be in possession of many elements material to the formation of an accurate judgment, which they cannot disclose. Thus, for instance, with respect to the treaty which was last night referred to, which treaty provided for the employment of a naval force, how was it possible for the executive, which could only know of the secret article of the treaty, to impart to the committee that material element to its judgment&#x2014;and how could such a committee have proceeded to deliberation, without the knowledge of such a circumstance, excepting by confidence in the executive? All I can say, Sir, is, that to enable the committee to take an accurate and comprehensive view, every possible assistance will be given, I can say no more than this. It was the rule on which the committee acted in 1817, and no other rule will be acted on now.<lb/>
There is one point, Sir, to which, before I conclude, I am anxious to address myself, and upon which I have always had a very strong feeling; I had thought, indeed, of introducing a few words into the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0226"/>
<col>437</col>
motion expressive of that feeling. Sir, I refer to the advantage and necessity of a simplification of the public accounts. I have no doubt that, without any express words, the committee will feel themselves warranted in taking that important subject into their serious consideration. No man is more desirous than I am to see the public accounts presented in the simplest possible form. And I can only say, that if the committee shall be able to recommend any plan for the attainment of this object, they will secure for the country a great public advantage. I see no reason, Sir, why we should not follow the example set us, in this respect, by France and the United States of America. I am quite certain that we shall do well to profit by such example, and I can see no single disadvantage attending it.<lb/>
I thank the House for the indulgence which has been extended to me, in the statement of details which it would have been scarcely possible to have relieved from the dryness which notoriously attaches to such subjects. I trust I have said enough to shew in what spirit this committee has been proposed, and to convince the House that it proceeds, on the part of his majesty's government, from a sincere desire to meet parliament and the country, fairly and fully, upon a subject of such vital importance. I know that, from a person in my situation, professions of economy are suspected as things of course, and as intended to mislead. But I state earnestly and confidently to the House, that there is, on the part of the present administration, in taking the affairs of this country under its guidance, a resolute determination to effect all possible economy in the public expenditure. An hon. gentleman, the other night, declared it to be his opinion, that, whatever the disposition of government might be, that disposition would be overruled by an influence which rendered it imperative to maintain large establishments to satiate that influence. To this, Sir, speaking from experience in the business of government, I give an unqualified denial.<lb/>
I shall not now go back to the increase which may have taken place in the different departments during the particular periods upon which I have addressed myself to the House, but must say, that I cannot agree with the hon. member for Aberdeen in the causes to which he refers this increase. I believe that the increase of
<col>438</col>
which he complains has been partly, and indeed principally, owing to the views entertained by each particular department with respect to its own service, without, perhaps, paying very particular reference to the general expenses of all; and, at any rate, I entirely differ from the hon. gentleman, because I am convinced that the expenses thus incurred have been entered into from the laudable desire of each head of a department to have the establishment under his control in the best possible condition, and, most certainly, from other and better motives than those assigned by the hon. gentleman. In saying this, I speak, Sir, from experience. In the department which I have had especially under my control, I confess I always entertained a wish to have all the establishments connected with it kept up in the best possible state, without considering what the effect might be upon the general expenditure of the country. What I now wish is, that there should be one general and effectual control over all the establishments of the country; and I believe that the noble individual at present at the head of the highest department in the country, has the disposition, as well as the power, to exercise a greater and more efficient control over all the subordinate establishments, than any other person ever placed in a similar situation. I wish to avoid introducing, upon this occasion, any thing like a political or party feeling into the consideration of a matter of this importance. I only mention the name of that noble person upon this occasion, because I consider him more capable than any other individual of efficiently executing that control, so indispensable to the well-being of the country. I say this, because, in the various civil offices which he has filled, there can be no one who has not seen, both in the ordnance and other departments heretofore under his direction, the most anxious desire on his part to introduce every retrenchment and every degree of economy, compatible with the interests of the country. I am sure that that noble individual sees no cause to despond at the situation of the country, although he has the desire to look its financial state fairly in the face, and has the most earnest wish that every possible reduction should be made. I know that these are his wishes, but only under the imperative obligation of maintaining to the strict letter of the bond, the national faith
<image src="S2V0018P0I0227"/>
<col>439</col>
with the public creditor; for which he is fully assured means are to be found in the resources of the country, and upon which account he feels that there is not the slightest cause for despondency. In this feeling, Sir, I fully participate. I speak my own sentiments, as well as those of the noble individual at the head of the government, when I express my belief, that if it were necessary to make an appeal to the country, and to rouse its dormant powers, those powers may at all times be roused, in the cause of justice and in vindication of the national honour&#x2014;that there never was a time that could be productive of mightier efforts, founded on the unimpaired resources of its finances and the matchless energy for which it has at all times been distinguished. I move, Sir,
<quote>"That a Select Committee be appointed, to inquire into the State of the Public Income and Expenditure of the United Kingdom, and to consider and report to the House, what further regulations and checks it may be proper, in their opinion, to adopt, for establishing an effectual control upon all charges incurred in the receipt, custody, and application, of the Public Money; and what further measures can be adopted for reducing any part of the Public Expenditure without detriment to the Public Service."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00314"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that he did not rise for the purpose of offering any opposition to the motion, but he wished to put it to the right hon. gentleman, whether he could be able to carry the proposed objects into effect by the aid of one committee? He was anxious also to learn, whether the committee was to inquire into the state of the Crown lands, the hereditary revenues, and other matters upon which inquiry had been often promised, but never entered into? He was desirous at the outset to make this inquiry; for, as nearly as he could gather, the words of the present motion were the same as those for the appointment of a select committee in 1817; and yet that committee had inquired into very few of the objects for which they had been appointed. It also appeared, that none of the committees appointed had gone into all the subjects which it was said would be submitted to them; although some of them had sat for several years, and had presented ten or twelve reports. If the proposed committee were to be so long occupied, was it to have those several matters submitted to its con-
<col>440</col>
sideration? Did the right hon. gentleman intend to provide for the deficit of two millions?&#x2014;Did he intend to make arrangements respecting the sinking fund, or to provide for the deficiency which would take place when the Bank should cease to make any payments on the naval and military half-pay and pensions? Were these things to be brought before the House separately; or were they to wait until they had been submitted to the consideration of the committee of finance? If these, and the other matters, which, in his opinion, should be referred to a committee, should be referred to the present committee, it would be impossible it could do them justice.&#x2014;He had prepared a statement of the different branches connected with the public revenue and expenditure of the country, and he would say, that if the committee were to direct its attention to all of them it would be impossible it should terminate its labours in less than two or three years. What he, therefore, would suggest would be, the appointment of ten or eleven finance committees [a laugh]. He was aware that this was quite a novel thing to propose, and was prepared to expect objections to it; there being so few members who were disposed to take any labour upon themselves. But he must contend, that if the right hon. gentleman was serious in proposing a consideration of all the points to which he had referred, it would be quite impossible that they could be gone into by one committee consisting of twenty or thirty members. It would be impossible that, with any chance of effect, in this or the next session, they could go into an inquiry or make any report, not merely respecting one, but twenty departments, which ought to be submitted to their consideration.&#x2014;He would show that it was not so easy a matter to conduct these inquiries by one committee, as some gentlemen seemed to think. Let the House look at the last committee appointed; he meant that which was called sir Charles Long's committee. This committee was occupied for five years with the Customs and Excise, and with no other department of the public income or expenditure. The finance committee made thirteen or fourteen reports, and yet not one of them referred to the many departments into which, he contended, inquiry ought to be made; he meant the Crown lands, the hereditary revenues, the civil list, the expenses of our law courts, and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0228"/>
<col>441</col>
the colonies. He was glad to learn that there was an intention of making some inquiry respecting them; but he would ask, if any one inquiry could be effectual, if thus directed to so many objects. To consider these important matters with effect, the labours of one committee could not be finished in less than two or three years. If the House were in earnest they ought to divide the labour, by the appointment of many committees; which, by sitting from day to day, might be enabled by the end of the session, to present reports respecting the several departments connected with the revenue and expenditure of the country. By that means they might be enabled to point out many reductions, which it would be impossible otherwise to make. If this course was not adopted the committee now proposed would give the name, but few, if any, of the real advantages, of inquiry, or be productive of any practical good.&#x2014;If he pointed out the items of account which ought to become the subject of inquiry, it would appear that each of the eleven committees he proposed would have quite enough to do for the next two or three months. The committees he would suggest should be small in number&#x2014;not exceeding seven members for each committee, of whom five to be a quorum. All who were acquainted with the mode of doing business in select committees, would; agree with him, that it was done in a more regular, orderly, and efficient, manner by a small committee, than by one very numerous. Now, it appeared, that we had gone on increasing our debt since 1816, for he should be prepared to prove, that the right hon. gentleman was mistaken in asserting that there had been a decrease of upwards of 4,000,000<i>l.</i> in the charge of funded and unfunded debt since that period. He repeated&#x2014;we were going on increasing our debt at a period when we ought to be reducing it annually. We were bound, then, under the circumstances of the country, to reduce our expenditure, not 17,000,000<i>l.</i> or 16,000,000<i>l.</i>, but to that scale which would leave us such a surplus as would be efficient for the gradual reduction of ourdebt.&#x2014;The right hon. gentleman had talked of the resources of the country, and had said, there was no ground for despair. He also did not despair, who called for economy. He admitted the extent of our resources; but he hoped they would not be stretched to that extent, un-
<col>442</col>
til every means of economical reduction had been tried. The right hon. gentleman said, that those resources were all unimpaired. That, he doubted, for he feared it would be found, that the returns from every species of property embarked in trade were not such as could be desired, or as they had been sometime back. He would say, in the words of lord Castlereagh, in moving for the appointment of the finance committee of 1817, that a country must be mad which, in a state of peace, should go on, from year to year, consuming its income; and that it was the duty of the legislature to look forward, in time of peace, to a possible state of war, and so to reduce the expenditure as to leave a considerable surplus for the reduction of the public debt.&#x2014;Now this important duty, which had been thus pointed out by the noble lord, it would be impossible to perform, as far as it depended on an inquiry into the several branches of our income and expenditure, by the aid of one committee. He could assure the right hon. gentleman, that if he and the noble duke, to whom he had alluded, meant to have such an inquiry as would be followed up by practical reductions in the present session&#x2014;and he was not disposed to deny their good intentions&#x2014;they would find it impossible to carry their intentions into effect, by any other mode than that of several small committees of inquiry, consisting of five or seven members, who should meet from day to day. If these should be appointed, he had no doubt that, in the course of three months, they would be able to extend their inquiries to, and to report upon, the several departments which he should point out.&#x2014;To one of those committees he would refer the consideration of Customs and Excise; the changes which it might be necessary to; make in some of the duties, and the substitution of one duty for another would be sufficient to employ that committee for three or four months, and their report would be attended with considerable advantage.&#x2014;Another committee would find sufficient employment in inquiring into the departments of stamps, taxes, and hackney-coaches. Gentlemen were, perhaps, not aware that there was a department under that head, under which were included several items; and this department, which was kept up at an expense of some 10,000<i>l.</i> or 15,000<i>l.</i> a-year, might with advantage be transferred to the board of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0229"/>
<col>443</col>
stamps and taxes. He stated this, because he knew that a board of stamps was kept up several years with seven commissioners, and during that time three commissioners were never in attendance at once. Now, he would pledge himself to the House, that if a committee were appointed to inquire into the boards of stamps and taxes, and that other board which he must not mention lest he should excite the laughter of the House, reductions might be made which would be most advantageous to the country.&#x2014;To another committee, he would submit an inquiry into a department which was, perhaps, the best conducted of any under the government; but in which there yet remained much to be done, if they looked to what took place respecting it in Ireland. He would have a committee appointed to examine into the Post-office department of England, Scotland, and Ireland; and he had no doubt that the country would derive great benefit from the result of that inquiry. He was ready to admit the great activity and talent of the gentleman who held the office of Secretary in that department; but it was impossible that one individual could give all the attention which was required in the three departments, of England, Ireland, and Scotland. An investigation into the improvements which might be made in that department would give a committee ample employment for three months.&#x2014;The next subject of inquiry which he would refer to another committee would be, the nature and management of the land revenue. In a report made on this subject in 1777, it appeared, that it was very productive; but since then no sufficient inquiry had been made into it, and much of its produce had been squandered away in useless establishments.&#x2014;The hereditary revenue of the Crown would of itself give ample employment to the investigations of a select committee for six months. Another subject of importance, which the right hon. gentleman alluded to, was one which deserved the best consideration of a separate committee: he meant the mode in which the public accounts were kept in the Exchequers of England, Scotland, and Ireland. It would scarcely be believed, that in the year 1828, the public accounts in England, the land of accounts and calculations, were kept in a manner similar to that of the savages in the Sandwich Islands. They all recollected the manner in which Robinson Cru-
<col>444</col>
soe kept his account of the passing days, by cutting notches on a piece of wood. Would it be believed that, in the Exchequer of England, at the present day, the same mode of notching a piece of wood, called a tally, was observed, to mark the receipt of the public money? One kind of notch was put for 100<i>l.</i>, another for 1,000<i>l.</i>, and so on. Was that, he asked, a fit mode in which to keep the public accounts of this country? He might also mention that some of the money accounts were kept in Latin. He believed that if a receiver of taxes paid a sum of money into the office, it was entered in Latin. The account was given in English. Suppose a payment of 5,360<i>l.</i> made from the land-tax revenue: it was entered in barbarous Latin, and certain notches made in a piece of wood or tally, to denote the hundreds and thousands received. Great inconvenience, in other respects, arose from the mode of keeping the accounts at the Exchequer and the Treasury. He therefore anticipated much benefit from the labours of a committee appointed to examine into the manner in which the public accounts were kept. Why keep the accounts at the two places? They served only to perplex and confuse. Why should not the public accounts of this country be kept in the same plain and simple manner in which they were kept in America and France? He had mentioned this subject four years ago, and some inquiry into it was promised, but it was postponed; as all other promised inquiries would be, unless some such plan as the one he now suggested was adopted, by referring each department to the consideration of a separate committee. He would also propose that the committee should inquire, not only how the accounts were kept, but should consider the best mode of keeping them in a simple form, and without that variety which served only to confuse.&#x2014;To the investigation of another committee he would submit the revenue and expenditure of those colonies which did not possess legislative assemblies. The committee should also inquire into the amount which the maintenance of such colonies cost Great Britain. He was glad to find that some notice was taken of this subject by the right hon. gentleman; but he would extend the inquiries to all colonies which had local legislatures. It was notorious that in Ceylon and other places, considerable revenues were squandered away, with-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0230"/>
<col>445</col>
out any account being rendered as to their application.&#x2014;Another committee might be usefully employed in inquiring into the manner in which the civil list was expended, in England, Scotland, and Ireland; the salaries of judges, the pensions and allowances to officers of state; the expenses of palaces and parks; and all the other charges which went to make up our miscellaneous expenditure, an expenditure which amounted to 2,500,000<i>l.</i> last year.&#x2014;He would also have a committee to inquire into the expenditure of the army and ordnance abroad and at home. Another should consider the navy, and all the expenses of dock-yards, and marine establishments, the several items of which would occupy the attention of a committee for three months. Besides the miscellaneous payments, he would also inquire into the expenditure under the head of civil contingencies; the expenses of Downing-street; the Board of Works; the amount of law charges; the expense and application of Irish charities; the expense of convicts, and several other items, which made up the long list in that very costly department. He had no doubt, if a strict inquiry were made into these matters, that a saving might be made of 500,000<i>l.</i> or 600,000<i>l.</i> out of the 2,500,000<i>l.</i> which they annually cost the country. He would also have a committee to inquire into the amount of our funded and unfunded debt, and the cost of its management. The committee would also have to inquire into the nature of the sinking fund, and the source from which it was derived; also into the arrangement respecting the half-pay and pensions, and also the savings' banks, on account of which so great an expense was undertaken by government. The committee would also have to consider why the South Sea company was continued, at an expense of about 12,000<i>l.</i> a-year, for no other purpose than that of paying a few hundred thousand pounds.&#x2014;These matters would, he thought, afford abundant occupation for the eleven committees; but if some of them should prove too heavy for one committee, subdivisions might be made of the matters referred to it. If the House seriously intended to benefit the country by inquiring into its income and expenditure, they would adopt this subdivision of labour. He would also suggest, that a general committee should be formed consisting of the chairman of all the other committees, and that
<col>446</col>
these, jointly, should draw up reports touching the several matters on which their respective committees had been employed. The House might reject his suggestions, in favour of the proposition of the right hon. gentleman. There was, however, this difference between the two&#x2014;that the one was nugatory, and the other would be efficient. He feared the committee would not produce the efficient results which the country expected from it. Unless it reduced the civil list, and all other expenses, beginning with his majesty, as an example to the rest of the nation, the country would not be satisfied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00315"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> [Right Hon. Henry Goulburn] was of opinion, that the proposition of the hon. member for Aberdeen, for appointing eleven or twelve separate committees instead of one, would be productive of no advantage. There would be, in the committee about to be appointed, ample opportunities of examining into the manner in which the public accounts were kept, and of amending the system wherever it might be found faulty. The hon. member had greatly exaggerated the defects of that system, when he had alluded to the marking of a stick in the Exchequer. That practice was a relic of barbarism, and had long since been discontinued. But, though he objected to the hon. member's proposition generally, he would assure him, that if there should be any particular branch of the expenditure, such, for instance, as that of the colonies, which the committee should think they could not adequately inquire into, he had no objection to delegate that particular subject to a separate committee. When he stated that, he conceivd he gave the best pledge of the spirit and intentions with which he should go into the committee. He should go into the committee with the full determination of accurately investigating, and of properly deciding upon, the several topics which would be brought under his notice; and he felt a strong conviction, that the labours of the committee would tend to reduce the public burthens, and to place the finances of the country in a materially improved condition.<lb/>
The motion for the appointment of a Committee was then agreed to. After which, Mr. Secretary Peel handed up to the Speaker the following list of the Members intended to form the said Committee: viz. Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0231"/>
<col>447</col>
Tierney, Mr. Herries, sir John Newport, Mr. Ward, lord viscount Althorp, Mr. Ashhurst, lord viscount Lowther, Mr. Hume, lord viscount Howick, sir Edward Knatchbull, Mr. Maberly, Mr. Home Drummond, Mr. Bankes, Mr. Alexander Baring, Mr. Robert Palmer, Mr. Littleton, Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald, sir Henry Parnell, Mr. Wilmot Horton, sir Matthew Ridley, Mr. Stanley. The Committee to have power to send for persons, papers, and records; to report from time to time, and to sit; notwithstanding any adjournment of the House, seven to be a quorum.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00316"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> expressed his surprise, that so few ministers of the Crown were appointed members of the committee. The omission of the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies struck him as most extraordinary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00317"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that the reason why more ministers were not in the list was, that the duties they had to perform occupied so much of their time, that it was impossible they could give any efficient attendance upon the committee. He had pressed his right hon. colleague to be a member of the committee; but he had refused upon the grounds just stated. He had been also desirous that the committee should have benefitted by the valuable assistance of the learned member opposite (Mr. Brougham); but the learned member had declined on account of his numerous professional avocations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00318"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> expressed a hope that the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies would re-consider the determination to which he had come. Without meaning any disrespect to the members composing the committee, he might say, that the aggregate amount of their financial knowledge, bore no proportion to that possessed by the right hon. gentleman; and that if they were deprived of his services, he should consider it a very serious disadvantage to the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00319"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> begged to add his entreaties to those of his hon. friend, that the name of the right hon. Secretary might be included in the list. He was especially anxious to give expression to what was the deliberate opinion of the House; namely, that the assistance of the right hon. gentleman was of the utmost value. He trusted that nothing had happened lately, and that nothing could happen, to make such an omission necessary; for nothing could remove the rooted conviction of the House, in favour of the proposition of his
<col>448</col>
hon. friend, that the knowledge of all the other members of the committee combined was as dust in the balance, compared with the resources of which the right hon. Secretary could bring into play. As to himself, he wished to express to the right hon. gentleman his thanks for the courtesy which dictated the communication that morning made to him; proposing to place him on the committee. Whether or not the House would have sanctioned the proposition, he certainly should have felt himself under the necessity of declining the appointment&#x2014;not that he was without a desire to advance the objects of the committee&#x2014;not that he felt any disrespect towards any party concerned in it&#x2014;not that he was without great confidence, in the good likely to ensue from its labours&#x2014;but that attendance on its sittings would interfere with his professional avocations. With respect to the propositions of his hon. friend, the member for Montrose, he thought that much good might result from the adoption of his suggestions, in consequence of their being likely to ensure what the House and the country so earnestly desired&#x2014;speedy reports. By dividing themselves into committees of six or seven each, they might pursue their investigations with infinitely more effect, than they otherwise could do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00320"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, he considered it necessary to say a few words, after the manner in which he had been appealed to by the hon. member for Callington, seconded, as that appeal was, by the hon. and learned gentleman. He certainly had, in the first communication with his right hon. colleague, on the subject of becoming a member of the committee, declined the proposition on account of the numerous official avocations which pressed upon him, and occupied nearly the whole of his time. Having, however, for a long series of years devoted the whole of his time to the public service, so far as his health and strength would permit, he was now willing, if it were in accordance with the feelings of the House, to attend the committee occasionally, and give so much of his assistance to it, as his health would allow. On this, as on all other occasions, the House might command his best services.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00321"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson's</member><membercontribution> name was accordingly added, by Mr. Peel, to the list of the committee. After which, the House adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00322">Numerous petitions were presented for the repeal of the said acts. On presenting petitions from North Shields and from Braunton,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00323"><member>Mr. Liddell</member><membercontribution> said, he would take occasion to observe that he entirely concurred in the prayer of the petition, more especially in that part of it which referred to the practice of requiring sacramental tests. He regretted that it would be impossible for him to attend in his place when the motion, of which notice had been given by a noble lord, would come before the House; consequently, he should not be able to give the proposition for the repeal of the Corporation and Test acts that support, to which he considered it entitled, and which it should otherwise receive at his hands.&#x2014;He would therefore avail himself of the present opportunity, of expressing in a few words, his opinions upon the subject, and the reasons which induced him to entertain them. He was aware, that in so doing, he might be accused of pursuing an irregular course; but he thought that every individual having the honour of a seat in that House, in such a case, was bound to consult the dictates of his own feelings, and more particularly when he represented a large body of people. It had been said, that the law in question constituted a bulwark of the church; but he was of a different opinion; and as a warm friend and sincere admirer of the discipline and doctrines of the church of England, he was decidedly opposed to these Tests, and thought it most desirable to repeal them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00325">The Chancellor of the Exchequer having moved the order of the day, for going into a Committee of Supply,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00326"><member>Lord Normanby</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;If, Sir, I avail myself of the opportunity, on a motion which is usually one of form, but which, on some occasions, is resorted to as the constitutional one for purposes of important communication&#x2014;if I have recourse to such an extraordinary proceeding on this occasion, I can assure you, Sir, and the House, that it is with the most unfeigned reluctance that I adopt it; and I trust that ray excuse for
<col>450</col>
doing so will be found in the universal disappointment created by certain explanations not being given, which it was expected would have been made on Friday evening. That disappointment has now spread from one end of the country to the other. As that evening passed over without explanation, which was looked upon, by general understanding, as the evening on which these explanations were to take place, I thought it would be desirable that such an opportunity as the present should be afforded of giving full explanations to all those who may consider that their conduct required it. In referring, Sir, to the omission of explanation on a former evening, I am perfectly ready to believe, that that omission did not proceed from any unwillingness on the part of those from whom it was expected to enter into the fullest account of their conduct; but that they founded the reason of that omission in their conviction, that that peculiar occasion was not suited to the explanation. It is as an independent member of parliament, unconnected with all the parties whose conduct is affected by the transactions, in reference to which an explanation is expected, that I bring the subject now before the House. When I had determined to bring it forward, I intimated that intention to the right hon. the members for Liverpool and for Harwich, and I came to the determination, with the conviction, that the course I had determined to pursue, was the best that I could adopt towards those right hon. gentlemen, with a view of affording them an opportunity of laying whatever explanation they may deem requisite before the House and the country. I assure the right hon. gentleman, that a hostile feeling of any description I do not entertain towards them. And with respect to this administration, I took an opportunity, at an early period of the session, of stating that I by no means intended to offer an uncompromising opposition to it; I stated my intention of waiting for the measures which they should propose, and in being determined by the character of those measures, either in withholding from, or in giving to, it my support. As to the two administrations which have preceded the present, I was unconnected with them; indeed I was out of the country almost the whole time of their duration, and I did not give a single vote, or state any opinion respecting them. For many members of those ad
<image src="S2V0018P0I0233"/>
<col>451</col>
ministrations, however, I wish to state that I had a private regard; but, in the course am now pursuing, I beg to state, that it has been taken without concert, and that with whatever blame it may be visited, I alone am responsible for it. The course I have now to pursue is a short one, more particularly as it is enjoined upon me rather to ask information respecting the conduct of others, than to offer arguments. There was a general impression, that the discussion upon these explanations would originate with my right hon. friend (Mr. Tierney). Now, why such an impression should have prevailed I am at a loss to account; as it has been stated, by the head of the late administration (lord Goderich) that it was dissolved in consequence of the irreconcileable differences that arose between the two right hon. gentlemen now members of the same cabinet, and sitting on the opposite bench. I say, Sir, I am at a loss to account, why it should be expected that they should remain there silent, and that an explanation should be expected to originate with my right hon. friend, who has retired from office, and who has not been connected with, those differences, except through the intervention of his communications with one of them.<lb/>
It must be notorious, that, in another place, a noble lord at the head of the late administration, stated, that the immediate cause of the dissolution of that administration was the irreconcileable differences between two right hon. gentlemen, with reference to the chairmanship of the Finance Committee, and the appointment of my noble friend; (lord Althorp), who was named for that office, I will only say, that there is no member of the twenty-one appointed on that committee more eminently qualified than my noble friend, to discharge that office with credit to himself, and with satisfaction and benefit to the country.<lb/>
I now come to the statement which was made by lord Goderich in another place, in which the conduct of the right hon. gentleman is immediately involved. After some preliminary remarks, introductory of the circumstances attendant on the nomination of my noble friend to the chairmanship of the Finance Committee, the noble lord proceeded:&#x2014;" It did happen, without my being aware at the time that such a step had been adopted, that a communication on the subject had been made,

though not with a view in any degree to pledge the government to the individual in question (lord Althorp), for the purpose of ascertaining whether, if ministers should feel disposed to recommend his nomination as chairman of the committee, he would undertake the duty? That communication, I beg to say again, was certainly made without my knowledge; it was also made without the knowledge of the member of the government, who, from his situation, must necessarily be materially interested in all matters relating to that subject; I mean, that the communication had been made without the immediate knowledge of the chancellor of the Exchequer. But it was not made at all as a point that was settled, and it was not made in a manner to pledge the government, or. to bind it in any way, at least as I understood, afterwards. Had any objection been made, it was not intended to persist in the appointment. When I learnt that the communication had been made, the result of which to myself was personally nothing but satisfactory, from the opinion I entertained of the individual, the first question I asked was, whether there had been any previous communication with the chancellor of the Exchequer? I was informed that there had not been any. I lamented that; I could not but lament it, and I thought it an oversight. It seemed to me an unfortunate circumstance, that any thing should have passed upon the subject beyond our own immediate circle. I begged that no time should be lost in putting my right hon. friend in possession of what had been said, and in explaining to him the whole of the circumstances. This was done by my right hon. friend, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He explained to the chancellor of the Exchequer fully, alt that had occurred upon the subject. No objection was made by the chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;no offence was taken by him at the time, as far as I have heard, to any thing that had been done. It did, however, so happen, that the next day&#x2014;after he had had the subject under his consideration&#x2014;he found that there were very strong objections to the proposed appointment which had been so submitted to him. He stated those objections to me; but I understood them to refer much more to the fact, that no previous communication had been had with him, than to the individual who had been
<image src="S2V0018P0I0234"/>
<col>453</col>
named, and to whose appointment he could not accede. Explanations followed between the chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and various letters passed between them, I certainly considered those explanations perfectly satisfactory; and so, I have every reason to believe, did the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He was so entirely convinced, that he had removed the objections of the chancellor of the Exchequer, that he never communicated to me the correspondence that had passed between the chancellor of the Exchequer and the right hon. gentleman who originally suggested the name of the individual qualified to be chairman of the committee. I had no reason to believe that there was any such difference of opinion, as would leave any party concerned to conceive, that if the appointment had been persisted in, it would be impossible for the individual objecting to remain a member of the government. All this, the House will bear in mind, took place between the end of November and the beginning of December; and, on the 22nd of December, I received a letter from the chancellor of the Exchequer, in which he first of all stated to me his objection to the appointment proposed, as a matter of form. He also mentioned the general grounds, of a public nature, on which he rested his resistance to the nomination that had been made; and he concluded his letter by observing, that under these circumstances, and feeling these objections so strongly upon principle, he felt it his duty to place his office entirely at my disposal. The conclusion I drew certainly from that letter was, that my right hon. friend tendered the resignation of his place, if the proposed nomination took place. It was utterly impossible not to see that that was the obvious meaning of the communication. I felt it my duty so to consider it. In answer to my right hon. friend, I stated, that he had greatly misunderstood the share I had in the previous discussion, which he called a negotiation. I explained to him, in writing, as I have explained to your lordships, how this misapprehension had arisen. I assured him there was no ground for saying, that any negotiation had been settled and concluded without his approbation; for, in fact, I had not been aware of it until it was passed. The result was, that while, on the one hand, the chancellor of the Exchequer, though, he was pressed in
<col>454</col>
the strongest manner not to risk that consistency which is the conformation of the government, and though the most earnest endeavours were made to satisfy him, that there was no sufficient reason for the objections he felt to the proposed nomination&#x2014;always referred to his first letter, which involved his resignation, as the necessary consequence of that appointment: on the other hand, the Secretary of State for the Colonies distinctly and unequivocally stated, not only in conversation, but in writing, that he felt his own honour and character to be so involved in the maintenance of that nomination, that it was utterly impossible that he could acquiesce in any change."<lb/>
The noble lord, at the head of the late administration, then proceeded to state, that the explanations went on, that he found the difference irreconcileable, and so reported the matter to his majesty, when the administration was dissolved. New, Sir, that which principally strikes the mind in the detail of this affair is, that the right hon. gentleman, the member for Harwich, did not at once impress the mind of the prime minister with the full extent of the difficulty under which he laboured&#x2014; that he did not at once state, that his objections rested on public grounds, and that he departed from the noble lord, leaving him secure in the opinion that the matter was easily explainable. This was the statement of the noble lord himself, and he was well known to be above all guile, and incapable of misrepresentation. It plainly appears, that in the opinion of lord Goderich, the objection of the right hon. gentleman applied solely to the manner of the nomination. If so, it was a mere slight&#x2014;a thing which would excite a feeling of chagrin, but which was to be easily removed by explanation. If the objection stood upon public grounds, then, indeed, the difficulty would be greater; but lord Goderich thought it was not so. It is to be borne in mind, that lord Goderich is an impartial witness in this case. It was he who introduced the right hon. gentleman to the government; and he has declared, that he understood from that right hon. gentleman, that his objection rested upon no public grounds, and was one easy of explanation. Then, Sir, what I ask is this&#x2014;how came the right hon. gentleman to allow the matter to remain quiescent in the minds of his colleagues, and to bring it forward at a distant period, unexpectedly
<image src="S2V0018P0I0235"/>
<col>455</col>
and most inconveniently, as the result shewed; although I do not impute to the right hon. gentleman any intention in so reserving himself? Upon these facts I make no comment: I express no opinion: I merely ask for explanation. All I say is, that when we see a right hon. gentleman, as in this case, not in habits of intimacy with his colleagues, not at once disclosing the state of his mind to them, but at intervals coming forward and renewing and perpetuating points of opposition and difference, until at length the administration, of which he is a member, falls beneath these repeated assaults&#x2014;all I say is, that there is something in all this which demands explanation before the world can be brought fully to understand it.<lb/>
This is all I have to say upon this point. But, when the right hon. Secretary for the coloniesvolunteered&#x2014;in a manner uncalled-for and gratuitous&#x2014;his explanation, it did appear to me singular that he should omit all mention of this quarrel. At the same time, I must say, that I have found it equally difficult to understand the extraordinary <i>non sequitur</i> of lord Goderich&#x2014; that when what had occurred was reported to him, the course for him to pursue was&#x2014; not to <i>decide,</i> but to <i>resign.</i> I will now proceed, Sir, to that which is the more important part of my inquiry&#x2014;I mean the principles upon which the government is to be conducted. When it was known to me that the right hon. gentleman had joined the present administration, it did certainly at first appear to me, that he had made some personal sacrifice in doing so. It was this impression on my mind, and on the minds of others, that created that extraordinary interest in the expected explanation of the right hon. gentleman. The opportunity for that explanation occurred at Liverpool; and I assure the right hon. gentleman that I read with great interest and real pleasure, the report of what occurred there. Sir; I will not enter into the question as between party and party&#x2014;between man and man &#x2014;as to what has been the conduct of the right hon. gentleman towards his late friends. If any ground of complaint of his conduct exist as to that point, I disclaim all knowledge of it. I know that there is a particular sort of disclaimer, which is understood to imply a concealed reproof: but I sincerely declare, that I have no such meaning upon the present
<col>456</col>
occasion. I have always looked upon the right hon. gentleman as a great public benefactor&#x2014;as the first of great practical reformers&#x2014; and I think him so much the more valuable, being in place, and especially when his principles are triumphant &#x2014;far more so than if he were a mere item in a minority, out of place. If, then, his principles are triumphant, I hail his appearance in his present place with the greatest satisfaction. Connected with this fact, however, there is, Sir, a circumstance, to which I must advert. I have said, that I have read the speech of the right hon. gentleman at Liverpool. I have read reports of it in the London papers; and it is but bare justice to say, that I never read reports more clear, more satisfactory, or exhibiting more direct internal evidence of accuracy and truth. By internal evidence, I mean such evidence as can be collected from the fact of the substance and the sentiments being throughout the same in all the papers, with those slight variations of expression which are themselves a proof of the report having been taken fairly. It is impossible for me to suppose, that a set of men so respectable as the London reporters, and who discharge their very difficult and important duties with so much impartiality and talent,&#x2014;it is impossible for me to suppose, that such a body of persons should have entered into a conspiracy to misrepresent the language, or compromise the character, of any public man; but I regret to say that there are individuals, by whom the authenticity of the reports of the right hon. Secretary's speech at Liverpool have been disputed. I would not have troubled the House with this fact, if peculiar circumstances had not led me to think it desirable that it should be mentioned. Last evening, a speech was put into my hand, published in a Liverpool paper, which was materially at variance with the reports of the speech of the right hon. Secretary for the colonies, which had been published in the London journals. I am informed, that a person in town has stated, that this report of the speech, which was in a paper called the "Liverpool Courier," was corrected by the right hon. Secretary himself.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S2V0018P0I0236"/>
<col>457</col>
that many most important passages are omitted; and these omissions consist of the passages which afforded me the greatest pleasure in the perusal. The first omission is in that part of the speech in which (according to the London papers) the right hon. gentleman, after stating the offer made to lord Harrowby, went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Notwithstanding, however, these unfavourable contingencies which were observable in the beginning of December, it was my anxious wish to see the administration continued by the same men and on the same principles. I wished to have upheld the government in its then state; and, so dear were the principles it espoused to my own feelings, that I would rather have fallen in the attempt to reconstruct its organization, than have withheld my poor services, or have kept back on such an occasion."</quote>
Important as this part of the speech is, in the report of the "Liverpool Courier" it is&#x2014;it will be difficult to conceive by what accident&#x2014;entirely omitted. The next passage to which I shall advert is one of considerable importance. It is to this effect&#x2014;
<quote>"It so happened, that the duke of Wellington, after consulting only with one individual, Mr. Peel, who possessed talents and integrity for the public service, I believe came next to myself. I will not disguise from my constituents, that when this communication was made to me, it was in most general terms. I was, in fact, merely asked if I felt any individual objection, or laboured under any particular motive or influence, to preclude me from taking any part in the ministry which the duke of Wellington was commanded to form. To an application so general I could only give a general reply. I could only state, that I was not precluded by party, or party connexions, to forego any attention to what I believed, in my own mind and judgment, to be due to the interests of my country; and that, provided the new administration were formed upon the principles which I had espoused, and which I thought indispensable to the welfare of the community, and provided also, I could see a pledge for the guarantee of the due operation of my principles, I was not deprived by any pledge of party, or engagement with others, from participating in their promotion. That was the general answer I gave to the general application I received."</quote>
<col>458</col>
Here again is another passage to the same effect&#x2014;
<quote>"I was under no feeling of obligation to consult others on such an occasion provided the stipulation for the principles which I advocated was complete, and my personal honour uncommitted."</quote>
And shortly after follows another passage, repeating the idea of guarantees&#x2014;
<quote>"Could I then, when my own great measures, or those of the men with whom I had acted, were conceded, refuse my concurrence, without a compromise, to the offer which had been made me? I did not look to the right or to the left, I prepared for the best I could accomplish, and think I acted judiciously."</quote>
Now, Sir, with respect to the contradiction given by the duke of Wellington, in another place, to this alleged statement of the right hon. gentleman, I will read only one extract from it to the House. The speech itself is short and distinct. I may here observe, that it is not necessary for me to inquire, how far it may be consistent with the character of public men to offer or to require guarantees. If individuals about to enter into the same cabinet are united by common principles, any guarantee from one to the other would be wholly out of the question. However, without inquiring how far any may have been deemed necessary in the present instance, I will read the words of the noble duke, and they are such as would, I fear, bar the most limited construction of any pledge or guarantee having been asked or given. The noble duke is represented to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"Is it to be supposed that the right hon. gentleman, to whom I understand the noble earl to allude, ever used such expressions as are ascribed to him at the Liverpool election. If I had entered into any such wholesale bargain, I should have tarnished the right hon. gentleman's fame as much as I should have disgraced my own. But if I gave a guarantee to my right hon. friend, what have I done for the other members of the government? Is there nobody else in the government but my right hon. friend? Every minister surely forms a part of it. Every one of them is equally at liberty to state his opinions upon every subject he may choose to propose for the consideration of government. I appeal to my noble friends, whether they ever belonged to a cabinet, in which questions were discussed more freely?"</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0237"/>
<col>459</col>
Now, the inference which I draw from this is, that the noble duke considers the right hon. gentleman correct in speaking of a guarantee, if he places reliance on the three or four members who with him belonged to the preceding cabinet; but against this that noble lord has a counter-guarantee, in the seven or eight other individuals who go to make up the new one. The noble duke himself seems to have interpreted the meaning of the right hon. gentleman somewhat in this way; for he says&#x2014;
<quote>"It is much more probable, though I have not thought it worth my while to ask for any explanation on the subject, that my right hon. friend stated, not that he had concluded any wholesale bargain with me, but that the men of whom the government is now composed are in themselves a guarantee to the public that their measures will be such as will be conducive to his majesty's honour and interests, and to the happiness of the people. That is what the right hon. gentleman said, if I am not mistaken; and not that I had given him any guarantee for the principles of the government."</quote>
Now, Sir, as I am quite sure that the right hon. gentleman could never have stated what the noble duke thus supposes he did state; as I am quite sure that the right hon. gentleman could never have stated, as the simple justification of his adherence to the government, his conviction that the members of that government would pursue such measures as would be conducive "to his majesty's honour and interests, and to the happiness of the people"&#x2014;the fact being, that a large majority of the members of the government had opposed the measures which the right hon. gentleman himself had declared were conducive to those ends; as I am quite sure that the right hon. gentleman could never have said any thing like this, I now ask him, in the perfect spirit of candour and fairness, to state to the House what it was that he really did say. Before I sit down, however, I feel that I should not completely fulfil the object which I have had in view in trespassing upon the patience of the House if I did not add a few words with respect to certain important, although comparatively minor points, on which I am desirous of obtaining some explanation from the right hon. gentleman. Those points are, the Catholic question, our domestic commercial policy,
<col>460</col>
and our foreign policy. With respect to the first of these points, we have been told that the cabinet is to be strictly neutral on the Catholic question. Sir, I am glad to hear that. But, at the same time, I cannot help agreeing with what was said last year by the right hon. gentleman, now the Secretary of State for the Home Department, that whatever might be the declared neutrality of the then cabinet on that subject, the opinion of the right hon. gentleman who at that period was at the head of the government had a natural tendency to the advancement of the question. The converse of that proposition must be equally true. The right hon. Secretary for the Colonies will no doubt contend, that he joined the government on the ground, that patronage was to be equally distributed, without reference to the Catholic question. I am far from saying that it is not intended to maintain such a neutrality. But, does not patronage naturally flow in the direction which corresponds with the opinions of the individual who is at the head of public affairs, and to whom, therefore, that patronage principally belongs? Indeed, that was last year assigned as a reason by the present Secretary of State for the Home Department, for not taking a part in the administration of which Mr. Canning was the head. The right hon. gentleman distinctly stated, that the influence of the situation of prime minister gave a bias to the subject, which was not consistent with his views of it, and therefore he declined to hold office under Mr. Canning. That reasoning was even admitted by Mr. Canning himself, who remarked that the situation he held was not sought for by him, and was accepted only in compliance with the commands he had received. I do not mean to deny, that the alleged arrangements respecting patronage are fairly meant, but I repeat, that patronage naturally flows according to the bias of those in whose custody it is held; and, where the possessor has an anti-catholic feeling, it must be expected that, in a majority of instances, that patronage will be directed according to that feeling. I have heard on this subject an opinion which to me seems quite a paradox. It is said, that the more the government is opposed to the question, the greater is its' chance of success. If this be true, the supporters of the measure have only t0 change their vote, and thus give the bene
<image src="S2V0018P0I0238"/>
<col>461</col>
fit of their opposition to the measure. But, Sir, this is a grave subject. Look at the comparative state of Ireland last year, and at the present moment. Is it possible that we can conceal from ourselves, that the tranquillity which pervaded Ireland last year was not apathy, but the confidence entertained by the Catholics of Ireland, in the sentiments of the then cabinet? Now, Sir, as this is not to be a question of to-day or to-morrow, is it nothing in what temper we leave seven millions of our fellow-subjects to wait the decision which they consider as of the utmost importance to them? Leaving that point, however, with a hope that in the course of two or three months something will be done respecting it, I proceed to the consideration of the other topics which I mentioned. On that of our commercial policy, a distinction must be drawn between our colonial and our general policy. With regard to our colonial policy, I am quite persuaded of the advantages which will result to the country, from the right hon. gentleman's remaining in office. But with reference to our general commercial policy, it should be recollected, that the right hon. gentleman was formerly assisted by the opposition side of the House, but was counteracted in his views by some of those who are now his colleagues. There was the amendment made in the Corn-bill last year by the noble duke and his friends. That amendment was either an important one, or it was not. If it was not important, how can the noble duke and his coadjutors exonerate themselves from the imputation of faction in pressing it? If it was important, how can the right hon. gentleman and his colleagues exonerate themselves from the imputation of captiousness in throwing up the bill? The right hon. gentleman is now the colleague of the men who, but last year, defeated his own measure.<lb/>
Sir, with respect to our foreign policy, I feel that it is a subject of great delicacy. Many things have occurred, since the formation of the present government, which, I own, I regard with alarm. First, there was the tone of the Speech from the Throne&#x2014;a tone, the more to be lamented, as it was so strikingly contrasted by the cordiality and graciousness of the French King's Speech. Nor, Sir, am I quite satisfied with the cold and constrained acquiescence in the Treaty of London; as if it is to be carried into effect, not because
<col>462</col>
it is a desirable measure, but merely because it is a treaty. If the argument, however, respecting that treaty be one of consistency, there is no man more committed to its execution than the noble duke at the head of the government, who signed the protocol; although, certainly, I am not prepared to say that the Protocol and the Treaty are exactly the same.<lb/>
Sir, my apprehensions have been increased by other occurrences. With the utmost astonishment I have heard itasked&#x2014; What is there new in the foreign policy of Mr. Canning? The inference being, that Mr. Canning's foreign policy was the same as that of his predecessor. Sir, if such a notion had been broached any where but where it was, either at home or abroad, in a cabinet or a caf&#x00E9;, it would have been received with undisguised amazement. I perfectly recollect what was said of a note found by Mr. Canning, in the portfolio of his predecessor; but of this I am sure, that but for Mr. Canning, there it would have remained to the present hour. The broad distinction between the policy of Mr. Canning and the policy of his predecessor, is recognised throughout the whole continent. I have never been in any foreign society in which it has not been unequivocally acknowledged. And here, Sir, I beg leave to say, that I feel most happy to bear my testimony to the universal and concurrent feeling, at home and abroad, with respect to the distinguished merits of that great statesman. With him I never had any personal connection. He is now no more; and his party are scattered to the winds. In the present cabinet his name must not be mentioned. It would be the signal for discord. Throughout the whole continent, however, I well know, from verbal and from written communications, that the death of Mr. Canning was considered, by almost every individual, as a personal calamity; and he was universally characterised as the constitutional minister of England. Sir, when I recollect by what means Mr. Canning obtained this unexampled popularity in foreign countries&#x2014;when I recollect that he obtained it by consulting, and not by sacrificing, the interests of his own country&#x2014; when I recollect that he obtained it by freeing England from the disgraceful shackles of her connexion with the Holy Alliance&#x2014;when I recollect that he obtained it by vindicating her high and independent station among the nations of Europe&#x2014;
<image src="S2V0018P0I0239"/>
<col>463</col>
when I recollect all these things, I cannot but consider the universal testimony which has been borne to his merits as reflecting more honour on his memory, than belongs to all the blood-bought trophies of the noble duke at the head of his majesty's government.<lb/>
Sir, I am aware of the delicacy of the task which I have now brought to a conclusion. I have anxiously endeavoured to avoid going beyond what the necessity of the case seemed to me to require. I have been induced by imperative, perhaps mistaken, but certainly sincere, feelings of public duty, to adopt the step which I have taken. Whatever my political conduct may have been, I have the satisfaction to know, that it has never lost me the good opinion of a single connexion, or, as far as I know, made me a single enemy. If, therefore, I have, in the course of my observations this evening, given offence to any one, it has been unintentional, and I shall sincerely regret it. But I will no longer detain the House from hearing that statement for which, on every account, they must be so anxious.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00329"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke to the following effect: &#x2014; Sir, whatever may be the motives which actuate the noble lord on any occasion, I am perfectly persuaded that they will be found to do him honour; and that, in the exercise of his public duty, he will be invariably guided by the purest and most laudable considerations. For myself, I feel deeply indebted to the noble lord for the step which he has this evening taken, and still more so for the manner in which he has taken it. Ever since my return from Liverpool, I have been, day after day, led to expect that an opportunity would be afforded me of submitting to the House an explanation of my conduct. What have been the circumstances which changed the intention of those who had expressed their determination to elicit that explanation, it is not for me to say. I am most grateful to the noble lord for giving me this occasion. The contrast exhibited between the manly and straight-forward course which the noble lord has pursued, and the proceedings in this House on Friday last&#x2014;followed up, as those proceedings were, by an attempt out of doors, to convert them into the means of injury to my character &#x2014;will not speedily be effaced from my recollection. At the same time, Sir, while I most sincerely rejoice at having
<col>464</col>
this opportunity given me of explaining the circumstances, as far as I am connected with them, which attended the breaking up of the late administration, and the formation of the present, I certainly must add, that I offer that explanation, under feelings of difficulty and anxiety, greater than any that I ever before experienced, when rising to address this House. If no other interest attaches to these transactions about which I am going to address the House, than the circumstance of their involving the personal character and honour of the individual, I know enough of this House, from long experience, to feel assured that they will extend to any hon. member&#x2014;not to myself in particular&#x2014; their best indulgence during his vindication. This they would, I am persuaded, readily do, if the matter were a mere private transaction; but when the object of the inquiry affects the honour of a public man&#x2014;and here I entirely agree with the noble lord, that the character of such a person becomes public property,&#x2014;and more especially if, at the time, the individual holds a high seat in the councils of his sovereign, and by the favour of that sovereign discharges the duties of one of the most important offices of the state &#x2014;when the object becomes so marked, from that moment it ceases to be of a personal nature, and assumes a public character of the greatest general importance. It is on the latter ground, and on the latter ground alone, that I now claim that attention and that indulgence, which, I am persuaded, in the situation in which I am placed, there is no hon. gentleman with right feelings will not be induced to grant me, whatever may be the political differences existing between us.<lb/>
Sir, before I proceed to answer any of the questions which have been put to me by the noble lord, or to advert to the subject at all, I trust I may be allowed to state, and that without the slightest reserve or qualification, that, since my return from Liverpool, I have not had, either directly or indirectly, any communication whatever with any of my noble and right hon. friends in the administration; either with reference to what I am reported to have said at Liverpool; or with reference to what some of them are reported to have said elsewhere; or with reference to what Lam now about to say to the House, I wish to state this most fully and explicitly; and I hope that every hon. gentleman who
<image src="S2V0018P0I0240"/>
<col>465</col>
hears me will bear it in mind during the whole course of the explanation into which I am about to enter. Whatever may be the impression, or whatever the consequences, of that explanation, I wish it to be distinctly understood by the House that I, and I alone, am responsible. At the same time I can assure my right hon. friends near me&#x2014;and I am persuaded that they will give me credit for the assurance&#x2014; that it has not been from the slightest want of confidence in them, that I have abstained from any such communication; but because I felt that, if I made it, both they and I should be exposed to the imputation of casting our parts, or comparing notes, together: an imputation from which we shall now, I trust, stand perfectly free. It is not my intention, Sir, to enter at all into any of the transactions which occurred between the period of my return to England, and the period at which the noble lord has taken up the inquiry; namely, the period at which the name of the noble member for Northamptonshire, lord Althorp, was first introduced, as connected with this subject. &#x2014;I believe, indeed I know &#x2014; that it was in the middle of November, my noble friend lord Goderich, while talking with with me one morning at his office, upon general business, casually stated in conversation, that my right hon. friend, the then master of the Mint (Mr. Tierney), had suggested to him, that it might be exceedingly desirable to ask lord Althorp whether he would be disposed to undertake the office of chairman of the intended Finance Committee. My noble friend further told me, that he had had a good deal of conversation with my right hon. friend, in the course of which my noble friend stated, that from long habits of personal esteem and friendship for the noble member for Northamptonshire, he should be very glad to make use of that noble lord's talents for business in any capacity; but that, as the subjects to which the attention of the committee were to be directed were so connected with this House, he wished rather to consult those members of the administration who had seats in it. My noble friend did not ask me my opinion upon the subject. He merely stated, what had passed between himself and my right hon. friend, the then master of the Mint; and added, that he considered that the talents, and the inclination for business of the noble member for Northamp
<col>466</col>
tonshire, must render him well qualified for the situation of chairman of the committee of finance. I expressed my doubts on that point; not as to the fitness of the noble member for Northamptonshire for being placed on the committee, for it was impossible that there could be any difference of opinion between my noble friend and myself on that point, but I expressed my doubts, how far the industry and talents of the noble member for Northamptonshire, great as every one acknowledged them to be, had been especially directed to such objects as would qualify him for presiding over a committee of that nature. To this observation my noble friend replied, "Turn the matter over in your mind;" and so the conversation between us ended. And here, I beg to observe, that my noble friend did not state to me whether or not he had made a similar communication to any other members of the administration; nor did he desire me, or authorise me, to make a similar communication to any one.<lb/>
A few days after this at the breaking up of a cabinet dinner, my right hon. friend, the then master of the Mint (Mr. Tierney), asked me, if I had turned over in my mind the conversation which I had had with my noble friend at the head of his majesty's government. I told him, that I had been considering the subject; and that upon the whole, whatever my first impressions might have been, I was then strongly inclined to believe, that it would be for the public interest to endeavour to secure the services of the noble member for Northamptonshire, as chairman of the intended committee of finance. I Sir, I considered that conversation, as well as my previous conversation with lord Goderich, merely as I would the conversation of any two gentlemen, desirous to come to a correct conclusion on a subject on which they had a common object in view. The conversation to which I last alluded, took place on the 19th of November. Some days after, my noble friend at the head of his majesty's government, told me that he had heard from my right hon. friend, the master of the Mint&#x2014;that my right hon. friend had been sounding the noble earl (Spencer) the father of the noble member for Northamptonshire, respecting the probability that the noble member would accept the situation of chairman of the committee of finance if it were offered to him. There again my
<image src="S2V0018P0I0241"/>
<col>467</col>
right hon. friend undoubtedly adopted a proper course in going to the head of the government, and telling him what he had been doing. When, however, my noble friend mentioned the circumstance to me, I told him what had passed between my right hon. friend, the master of the Mint, and myself on the 19th of November. My noble friend then said, "Is the chancellor of the Exchequer acquainted with this?" I immediately replied, that I did not know whether or not he was acquainted with it; and that I had not been desired, or authorised, to make any communication to him on the subject; but that I took it for granted he had been made acquainted with it. My noble friend said, that if he had not, it was an oversight. I remarked that it was not my oversight; and that I did not hold myself responsible for it. My noble friend then requested me to see my right hon. friend, the chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Herries) and state to him what had occurred. The next day my right hon. friend called on me at my office; and I stated to him all that had passed on the subject between me and my noble friend at the head of the government, as well as between me and my right hon. friend, the master of the Mint. And here I am bound to say, that when I made that communication to my right hon. friend, the chancellor of the Exchequer, he seemed to take the same view of the case that we had done. We then entered into a discussion on other matters in the course of which, my right hon. friend, the master of the Mint, quite unexpectedly, and by accident, called on me. I told him what had passed. He said, "I am going to Brighton to-morrow, and under those circumstances I called upon you to talk to you about this very affair of the Finance Committee." We then discussed the subject; compared lists of the members of the intended committee, and, as I supposed, advanced a good deal in the business.<lb/>
On the next day, however, the 29th of November, I received a communication from my right hon. friend, the chancellor of the Exchequer, expressing a wish to see me; and, when we met, he informed me that he had some reason to take a different view of the subject from that which occurred to him on the day before, with respect to the person to be appointed chairman of the Finance Committee. He expressed his regret, that the
<col>468</col>
intention of appointing lord Althorp chairman had become a subject of conversation about town, and he also mentioned, as a great inconvenience, that several other names of the intended members of the committee were publicly spoken of. This my right hon. friend expressed his regret at; and I shared it with him; for unquestionably it is exceedingly improper that matters should be divulged, and made the subject of discussion out of doors, which ought to be strictly confined within the walls of the council-room; more especially under a mixed administration like that which, at the time, existed.<lb/>
What did I do upon receiving this communication? I wrote off immediately, though it was late in the day when I saw the chancellor of the Exchequer, to my right hon. friend (Mr. Tierney) at Brighton, expressing my great regret at hearing that these matters had been divulged abroad, and adding my earnest and anxious request, that the best means would be taken to prevent in future the repetition of any such improper disclosures; and, that above all, no other application should be made for any member to be upon the committee, without further consideration; and a copy of this letter I sent, on the same evening to the chancellor of the Exchequer, to show the feeling which I entertained upon these informal statements, and in order, as far as the means were in my power, to allay any unpleasant sensation which might have been raised in my right honourable friend's mind, from what had passed upon this business.<lb/>
This occurred on the 29th of November; and, on the 2nd of December I received from my right hon. friend (Mr. Tierney), an answer, in which he distinctly stated, that he felt as strong an objection as any man could feel to these improper disclosures, and felt as anxious a wish, that our arrangements and discussions should be unknown, save to ourselves. He further assured me in this letter, that he had never mentioned the name of a single member of the committee; and that with respect to lord Althorp, we were at perfect liberty, either to put him into the chair of the Finance Committee, or not, as we pleased; and, as a proof of this being the case, he enclosed me an extract of a letter which he had received from lord Althorp, in reply to one transmitted by him to the noble lord, to know whether, in case he should be applied to to become
<image src="S2V0018P0I0242"/>
<col>469</col>
chairman of the committee, he would, or would not, consent to fulfil the duties of the office. The noble lord's reply was, that if my right hon. friend (Mr. Tierney) should, at the proper time, think it his duty to suggest his name for the situation, and the suggestion should meet with the concurrence of the other members of the government, and provided also, that certain arrangements were made respecting the committee, he (lord Althorp) should not feel himself indisposed to accept the chairmanship. So that, up to the time to which I am referring, the nomination of lord Althorp, so far from being a complete and determined act, was unsettled and conditional, and remained merely as a topic which had been handled in casual conversation. On the day of my receiving this answer from Brighton I transmitted it under cover to the chancellor of the Exchequer, who subsequently returned it to me unaccompanied by a single observation. This is the whole of the correspondence,&#x2014;this the whole of what passed concerning the nomination of lord Althorp &#x2014;as far as I am informed or concerned. I beg, Sir, to add fairly and honestly &#x2014;for I scorn disguise&#x2014;that the matter, as it has occurred, strikes me as being of the most trifling and unimportant nature; and, although the chancellor of the Exchequer might have felt that some slight was conveyed at the name not having been originally mentioned to him, I am persuaded that every one who impartially views the question at issue, will feel that it was only an apparent slight. It would certainly have been a slight had it been so intended; but I solemnly declare that, on my part, no slight whatever was intended. It is my duty to add, that between the 2nd and the 26th of December, I did not hear one word more about the matter. Whether any thing passed between others, I do not know, and cannot be answerable for; but I repeat, that from the 2nd to the 26th, of December, I am bound to declare the subject had never been revived either to or by me. Before the 26th, however, when it was again agitated, there had occurred many circumstances which tended materially to impair the strength and to shake the stability of the administration. Some of the principal of them are of a nature so notorious as to render it unnecessary for me to state them; while there are others which have Come to my knowledge in such a manner,
<col>470</col>
as to preclude me from stating them to the House; but the impression that struck my mind from them all was, that the administration, as constituted at that time, was exposed to the greatest difficulties. These were tome ominous signs, which I could not mistake; but nevertheless, I can take upon myself sincerely to state, that on the 23rd of December, when, not having been out of town during the preceding period of which I have been speaking, I went for four or five days, on a visit to my noble friend the Secretary of War, in the country, I had determined to use my best efforts to keep that government together, and had prepared myself, in the best manner I could, to arrange the business for the approaching meeting of parliament. On the day I left London, I did, by word of mouth to some, and by letters to others of my colleagues, state my distinct feeling to be this&#x2014;whatever might be the risk, I would rather bear the trial of meeting the business of the country in the House, than appear, under all the circumstances, to shrink from the struggle. On the 23rd of December, I went on a visit to my noble friend the Secretary at War. On the 26th, I received a communication from lord Goderich, enclosing one from the chancellor of the Exchequer, to the effect stated by my noble friend in the other House of parliament; namely, that my right hon. friend would resign if lord Althorp's appointment were persevered in. My right hon. friend had misconceived or misunderstood the noble lord touching the nomination, and thought that the government had pledged themselves to the intended chairman of the committee. When I received this communication from my noble friend I was left at liberty to mention it to the noble Secretary at War, at whose house I was; I did impart it to him accordingly, and, at the same time, after stating the pains which I had taken, up to that moment, to reconcile and arrange these differences, and the hopes I had of being able to accomplish it, I deliberately informed my noble friend that I could no longer, with any chance of being able usefully to conduct the affairs of the government, remain in office, and that I clearly saw the administration was at an end; I saw that the full and cordial co-operation on which I had depended was not likely to be continued,&#x2014;that the members of the government did not seem likely to pull together, in the degree of cordiality that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0243"/>
<col>471</col>
could assure their continuance; and feeling therefore convinced, that unless the most perfect co-operation and good understanding prevailed, any endeavours on my part to promote the public interests would be useless, I determined not to expose them to instability or jeopardy, or to risk my own character or injure my sphere of usefulness, such as it might be, by continuing any longer a member of a government so constituted. I then told my noble friend, the Secretary at War, that I despaired of being able to accomplish that which, up to the time I refer to, I had not given over the hope of effecting, and could no longer consent to remain in office.<lb/>
This, Sir, occurred on the 27th of December, and on the 28th I returned to town, and waited upon lord Goderich. To my noble friend I laid open my mind, as I do now to the House. He told me distinctly and explicitly, that the question of the chairmanship of the committee of finance was, in the abstract, of trifling importance; for there were a number of members of parliament quite as competent to perform the duties as lord Althorp was; without meaning, in any degree to disparage the noble lord's just pretensions. But I could not dissemble, that the manner in which this obstacle had unfortunately arisen, could not, in my judgment, be easily overcome; and that, from the moment it was indispensably required that this particular arrangement should be abandoned I could not recede, without admitting such a concession as I knew would be hailed by some as a subject of triumph&#x2014;would tend to lower me in the public mind&#x2014;would expose me even in this House to be taunted for my want of firmness&#x2014;and have consequently much diminished the measure of my usefulness in the official sphere which I then occupied. The abstract question was itself, I repeat, of no moment; but it became raised by accompanying circumstances, into vital importance, and assumed a pregnant and imposing form.<lb/>
On the 29th of December, a Cabinet council was summoned, to take into consideration a question of great public importance. I must now beg the House to pay attention to dates and circumstances; for they are, in this stage, of so much importance, that I must be particular with respect to them, at the risk of being tedious. On the morning of the 29th, before the
<col>472</col>
Cabinet council met, I waited on my noble friend, lord Goderich, whose mind must have been prepared for such communications, by what had passed the day before. I told him that the difficulty which had been raised out of the question was such, that I could no longer consider myself in his majesty's service&#x2014;that it was my intention humbly to tender my resignation to his majesty&#x2014;that I had written a letter to the king;, conveying that tender; and, under these circumstances, I told my noble friend, that in order to prevent any inconvenient inferences, I would attend the Cabinet that day, but that I certainly would not take any part in its deliberations. My noble friend immediately stated to me in reply, "Then if you have come to this determination, my Administration is altogether at an end; for if you retire, I will not remain an hour longer in office, and the inevitable consequence is that there is an end of the Administration." My noble friend then suggested to me, what it was very proper he should suggest, and what had occurred to myself&#x2014;that before meeting the Cabinet, as it was appointed upon a subject connected with the foreign policy of the country, it would be right to state what I had stated to him to the noble earl at the head of the Foreign Department, in order that he might judge how far, under such circumstances, he would proceed to bring forward the measures he had to suggest. I made to the noble earl the same communication I had made to lord Goderich, and received from him the same observation. On that day, the marquis of Lansdowne came from Bow-wood, to attend the council, and he was to return the next morning. It occurred to me, that from the situation of the noble marquis in the Cabinet, it was not desirable that he should so return without knowing the determination I had come to. I therefore made the communication to lord Lansdowne, and his lordship stated to me in reply, what had been stated by the two other noble peers; namely, that what I intended to do would be the dissolution of the Administration. The noble marquis returned next morning to Bow-wood. A circumstance just then occurred, which, though having no necessary connexion with what I am relating, must nevertheless be mentioned. I allude to the arrival of the Infant of Portugal in London; for his intended visit to Windsor the next day prevented my then sending in my letter of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0244"/>
<col>473</col>
resignation. I postponed sending it for two or three days for this reason&#x2014;it was suggested to me, and very strongly, by those to whom I had made my communications, that, necessarily and indispensably, the step I was about to take would break up the administration; and I was asked, whether it would not be better to request lord Goderich to consider of the resignation tendered by the chancellor of the Exchequer. I yielded to this suggestion; and, on the first of January, I wrote a letter to my noble friend, requesting that he would ascertain distinctly from the chancellor of the Exchequer, whether he persisted in his resignation; and I further told my noble friend, that I should suspend any step, until I knew the result, which I begged him to communicate to me as soon as he received it. My noble friend carried on the correspondence with the chancellor of the Exchequer. He urged him to recall his determination; but was not successful in persuading him to do so. On the 8th of January, lord Goderich went to Windsor, waited on his majesty, and telling the whole difficulties of the case, opened to his majesty the situation of the government.&#x2014;My noble friend did what he was bound in duty to do&#x2014;he laid before his majesty fully, fairly, and honestly, the real state of the difficulties and perplexities into which the government was thrown. This is my decided opinion, as to the conduct of my noble friend; and no man will doubt that he acted disinterestedly and impartially, and according to the honest dictates of his judgment. He acted wisely in not concealing any part of the truth from his Sovereign&#x2014;whether he intended, when he went, to suggest any thing, I do not know.<lb/>
This took place on the 8th of January. On the 10th, two days after this communication was made by lord Goderich to his Sovereign, and after the administration was thereby at an end, the marquis of Lansdowne returned to town. I am now obliged to advert to the noble marquis, not certainly from any thing which has been said by my noble friend, but in order to clear up an insinuation which has been most unwarrantably thrown out in another place, with reference to the sincerity of my communications in that quarter. My noble friend returned to town on the evening of the 10th. I had received no communications from the noble duke, or from any Other quarter, that his grace was charged
<col>474</col>
by his majesty with the duty of forming a new administration. The noble marquis on his arrival in town, wrote to me to ask if I had sent in my resignation. I replied, that I had not; and I added, that a noble and learned lord had a communication to make to the marquis. The next day I saw the noble marquis, and asked whether he had received from the noble and learned lord any communication such as I had alluded to? The noble marquis replied in the negative; but he added, that he had received a communication from earl Dudley, who apprised him of what was the intended communication to which I had alluded in my letter. I did not at that time know what were the intentions of those charged to form a new administration. I only said to the noble marquis, if you receive any thing of consequence, any thing growing out of this communication, acquaint me with it, and give it proper consideration. He then told me the grounds upon which he found it impossible to connect himself with the new administration. These were chiefly considerations involving the Catholic question, and other matters arising out of the state of affairs in Ireland; and I am free to say, that I declared, in reply to lord Lansdowne, that these were not reasons which had force enough to preclude me from exercising my judgment, provided a solicitation to remain in office were made to me.<lb/>
I am the more desirous of alluding to this interview with my noble friend, because it has been insinuated, that I have been guilty of the trick of sounding the sentiments of my noble friend upon the announced intention of the duke of Wellington's offer to him of a share in the government, and then basely interposing to prevent that application from being made [A. murmur of "No."]. I say, yes. That charge has been insinuated against me. I have seen it in print, and I will assert my right to answer that as well as every other imputation, which may have been levelled at me. The House must be aware, that there are other modes of influencing public opinion, than by statements made in this House; and, standing here as a public man, I feel bound to repel the charge which has been insinuated against me elsewhere. I solemnly declare, then, that from the moment I had the communication with my noble friend, the marquis of Lansdowne, I considered my lips as sealed. I considered, that I was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0245"/>
<col>475</col>
not at liberty to communicate on the subject, either With my right hon. friend, or the noble duke, or to mention the noble marquis's name in any way whatever, with reference to the formation of a new administration. Indeed, if I had mentioned the noble marquis's name to the noble duke, what would have been the inference drawn from it? That I was inviting the duke to make a sham proposal to the noble marquis, when I knew that it would not he accepted. I might, upon this point, appeal to my noble friend, the earl of Carlisle, and ask him whether I did not, when I saw him two days after the communication I had had with lord Lansdowne, state to him in confidence, that what lord Lansdowne had said, precluded me from saying one word about his lordship to any person connected with the formation of a new administration.<lb/>
I trust the House will excuse me for entering into these details, which I however feel it necessary to do, because honesty, plain-dealing, and straight forward conduct in public men, constitute their strongest claim on the good opinion of the country. In like manner, I have been charged with having made a communication to all my colleagues in the late administration, except the chancellor of the Exchequer, with respect to the appointment of the noble lord opposite, as chairman of the committee of finance. And I have also been charged with having canvassed my colleagues to support that appointment against the feelings of the chancellor of the Exchequer. I state distinctly now, what must have been known to many persons before, that I never communicated on that subject with any person except lord Goderich and my right hon. friend opposite (Mr. Tierney), before the transaction took a course which rendered further communication necessary. I think, Sir, I have shown, that as far as relates to the late administration, I did, up to the last moment of its existence&#x2014;up to the last moment when it could possibly administer the affairs of the country&#x2014;use every effort to keep the elements of which it was composed together. I appeal to my right hon. friend opposite, and to every member of the late government, whether there has been any want of zeal or industry on my part&#x2014;whether I did not sacrifice time, health, every thing that was dear to me, to the endeavour to prevent the breaking-up of the administration.
<col>476</col>
Having travelled over so much matter, I now come to that part of the subject which embraces the explanation which I really think was called for by the circumstances attending the declaration which I lately made to my constituents. I have now arrived at what the noble lord opposite has been pleased to call the more important part of the subject &#x2014; and in that I agree with him&#x2014;namely, the explanation of what I am reported to have said at Liverpool, respecting my communication with the duke of Wellington, on the subject of the formation of the present ministry. Upon this point, I really must say, that I was not prepared to expect that the noble lord opposite would chime in with the animadversion made, in another place, respecting my recent address to my constituents, by calling it a gratuitous explanation, as though I had done something quite unnecessary in offering any explanation to my constituents.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00330"><member>Lord Normanby</member><membercontribution> observed, that the right hon. gentleman had misunderstood him, if he supposed he meant to cast any blame upon him for his conduct in that particular.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00331"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> proceeded.&#x2014;The noble lord certainly said, that I made a gratuitous explanation to my constituents, and the same remark, I am sorry to say, has been made, with something of a sneer, in another place. Notwithstanding the unfeigned respect I entertain for the great constitutional learning of the distinguished individual to whom I now allude, I must confess that I retain upon this point much of what seems now-a-days to be considered absolute prejudice. It appears to me, however it may to others, that when a member of this House accepts office under the Crown, and consequently vacates his seat, and when, his seat being so vacated, he offers himself again to his constituents, and solicits their confidence, or rather a renewal of their confidence, and of the trust which they before reposed in him, it is very natural, and quite in accordance with the theory and practice of the British constitution, to make such a statement as his constituents not only have a right to demand, but as they are almost exercising a duty in demanding, when they entertain any feelings of suspicion or jealousy. The doctrines of the school which would oppose such explanations between a member and his constituents, are not yet popular in Liver
<image src="S2V0018P0I0246"/>
<col>477</col>
pool; and if the noble individual in question, placed in my situation, had attempted to convince the electors of Liverpool, that they had no right to expect a declaration from a candidate, or had told them that the king's writ said nothing about questions and explanations&#x2014;not all the noble lord's virtues, transcendent abilities, and high character, would have appeared to them such a guarantee, as to induce them to return him to parliament.<lb/>
Having, Sir, almost by accident, stumbled on that unfortunate word "guarantee," I must fairly own, that I did more than once, use the word in the course of my address to my constituents at Liverpool; and I will further say, that under the like circumstances, even after all that I have heard, I should probably use it again. I must freely state the great surprise I feel that this word&#x2014;this unfortunate word "guarantee," about which so much nonsense has been uttered, and so much malice has been at work, for the last ten days&#x2014;should have been the subject of so much misconception amongst the community of this metropolis. I am at a loss to conceive what sort of understandings that class of persons must possess, amongst whom the statements to which I have just alluded circulated. Suppose for a moment, that my right hon. friend near me, or the noble duke at the head of the government had communicated with me on the principles of a contract to be made &#x2014;a bargain to be entered into between parties, having between them opposite and conflicting interests&#x2014;if they had thus bartered their own honour and character, how could they expect to keep the matter a secret? Is it to be believed that the noble duke would have sent to five or six gentlemen of untarnished honour and reputation, for the purpose of offering them such an insult? Can it be imagined that the duke of Wellington, with his exalted notions and nice sense of honour, was such a driveller as not to see that the offensive proposition, even if accepted, would be useless; because it would destroy the value of the services of those who were base enough to lend themselves to so base a transaction? On the part of the noble duke, of my noble friend at the head of the Foreign Department, and of myself, I positively deny that any such proposition was originated, entertained, or ever in the contemplation of any one of them. Should I, I ask, have displayed
<col>478</col>
any prudence&#x2014;using that word in its meanest sense&#x2014;in going to Liverpool, and exposing myself to such an imputation, when it was positively certain, that, ill a few days after, my statement would be contradicted by those persons to whom it had' been applied. I say, therefore, that I do not retract one syllable of what I said at Liverpool respecting guarantees: I will not qualify it in the slightest degree; but I beg the House to allow me to inform them what it was I really did say. I will not be answerable for the precise words in which I addressed my constituents. I will not be answerable to the noble lord opposite for the accuracy of reports of what I said&#x2014;reports made amidst the din, and noise, and interruption of a hustings at a popular election&#x2014;made, too, by reporters, who, however able, skilful, and intelligent, attended probably for the first time at an election at Liverpool, and perhaps labouring under the further disadvantage&#x2014;but of this I know nothing&#x2014; of bad accommodation. I am ready to say, what it was I stated to my constituents. I stated that, before I consented to form part of the present administration, I sought for explanation, as well in respect, of principles, as of pending measures, of, the general policy of the administration&#x2014; that having received an understanding in respect of those measures, and in respect of those principles, which appeared to me satisfactory, I considered that the best guarantee which could be offered to me of the execution of those measures, and of the furtherance of those principles, and of the understanding that they would not be departed from, was that the individuals who were, in some respect, the framers of those measures, and whose duty it would be to carry them into execution, were to continue in the offices which they held. I stated to my constituents, that the guarantee which I received was of this nature &#x2014;that the explanation which I had sought and obtained had been satisfactory to me, and that the continuance of my friends in office was the best possible guarantee that the acts of the administration would accord with the explanation I had received. I stated my belief that our foreign policy would remain unchanged; and I asked my constituents, whether they thought the' noble earl at the head of the Foreign-Department was a person likely to remain in office for the purpose of frustrating the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0247"/>
<col>479</col>
treaty which he had framed&#x2014;thus destroying his character, in the face of the country and the world? I recollect perfectly well, that I illustrated my argument in this manner. I asked those who were captiously questioning me, and hinting their suspicions, whether it was likely that my noble and right hon. friends had entered into a conspiracy to destroy their honour and character, by a dereliction of the public principles, and by a sacrifice of the measures to which they stood pledged? That my meaning was such as I have now stated, must have been obvious to every person at Liverpool: and that it was obvious to them, I know to be the fact. At' Liverpool people are much in the habit of dealing in securities and legal instruments; and when I spoke of guarantee in the way I did, they were aware that I was not speaking of an instrument under hand and seal, covenanting the execution of some particular engagement&#x2014;that, in fact, I was alluding only to assurances and understandings, that my colleagues would not sacrifice any principle, or forego any measure, which they considered essential to the interests of the country. If I am really called upon to state what passed between the noble duke and myself, I will willingly do so. I appeal to my right hon. friend near me, whether, up to the very morning when a list of the new government, by some accident, appeared in a newspaper, the noble duke did not consider, that I was at liberty to wait (notwithstanding the explanations and understandings which had been given) until I saw the construction of the whole government, in order that I might judge whether that construction afforded the best security for the enforcement of the principles and measures to which I have alluded. I am unwilling to mix my right hon. friend up in the present discussion, or to induce him to say one word on the subject; but I state in his presence, and he will contradict me if I am wrong, that when the noble duke applied to me to form part of the administration I told his grace, that I expected that lord Dudley, Mr. Grant, and Mr. Lamb, should be members of it. I did not ask for any stipulation on this point; nor did I communicate with any one of those individuals. I left it to the duke to do that, if he thought proper. The noble duke made a separate communication to each. If the noble duke had omitted to do so, should have considered
<col>480</col>
myself at liberty to withdraw from any connexion with the administration. Each having received a separate proposal and a separate explanation from his grace, they communicated with each other, and we then jointly requested an interview with his grace, in order that we might understand the explanations which we had received separately, in the same sense, one with the other. I ask of the House, whether it is possible that persons having the feelings of gentlemen could have acted otherwise? I have before stated, that the reporters, to whose general skill, diligence, and impartiality, I am most ready to bear witness, misconceived what I stated; but my constituents at Liverpool did not, as I have reason to know, labour under any such misconception. I will state the grounds upon which I make this assertion, and I request the attention of the House, as my character is, in some degree, interested upon the point; and I would likewise take the liberty of requesting the particular attention of the learned gentleman opposite (Mr. Brougham). The letter which I hold in my hand, I received this morning by post. So far, I am glad that this explanation has been postponed from Friday until this evening; since it has enabled me to procure the evidence of a witness above all suspicion &#x2014;no friend of mine&#x2014;either personally or politically&#x2014;a witness, whom I never saw in my life until I met him on the hustings at the day of election;&#x2014;one who, above all persons was most interested carefully to watch what I did say; because he had undertaken to reply to what might fall from me. I shall ever feel grateful to the writer of this letter, inasmuch as from a real sense of fair dealing, which always forms part of the character of Englishmen, however opposed in politics&#x2014;from a mere sense of charity, if I may use the expression, befitting the character of a minister of religion, who saw a person suffering under unjust imputations&#x2014;he came forward to give testimony in my behalf. The gentleman to whom I allude is the rev. Mr. Shepherd. The learned gentleman opposite knows that he is incapable of stating any thing that is not correct [" hear&#x0021;" from Mr. Brougham]; and moreover, he has no motive for any thing which he states on this occasion, except to satisfy justice. If I had not received this letter, the House would have been in possession of nothing more than my own
<image src="S2V0018P0I0248"/>
<col>481</col>
assertion of what I intended to say at Liverpool, opposed to imperfect reports; but I trust the House will do me the justice to believe, that in such a case I should have confidently relied upon my character with them, and should not have deigned to call upon any witness to support my statement. Mr. Shepherd's testimony, however, is voluntary, and comes from a quarter whence of all others I least expected it, and therefore I do not scruple to make use of it. Mr. Shepherd, I should observe, stood close beside me on the hustings, and therefore could not fail to hear distinctly all that passed. The letter is in the following terms:&#x2014;
<quote>"Sir; on reading my Morning Chronicle this evening, it appears to me that the London reporters must have greatly misunderstood an important part of your last speech at the hustings, on the occasion of your re-election. As I stood close to you on that occasion, and attentively remarked what you said, as it was my duty to do, in the circumstances in which I was placed, I have a distinct recollection, that when you spoke of guarantees, you said you found them in the composition of the cabinet, and especially in the introduction of lord Dudley, Mr. Grant, and one more, whom I do not at this instant call to mind. Of personal guarantees, as demanded from, and given by, the duke of Wellington, you did not say one word. Accordingly, my reply to what you said was, that I doubted whether, in the composition of the cabinet, you would find sufficient support for your liberal views. Perhaps, before you receive this, you will have run the gauntlet in the House of Commons. Should it arrive in time, however, I think it but right to put it at your disposal. Ministers have sufficient to answer for, without being inconvenienced by the errors of the gentlemen of the press.</quote>
<quote>"Your's, &amp;c. W. SHEPHERD."</quote>
There is a postscript which I will read for the benefit of the learned gentleman.
<quote>"P.S. &#x2014; I take it for granted Mr. Brougham will have some comments to make on the transaction; but that, on this point, he may not proceed on wrong grounds, I wish you to communicate the contents of this letter to him."</quote>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00333"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson.</member><membercontribution> &#x2014;I trust, Sir, I shall hear no more after this evening of a subject in relation to which I have been clearly misrepresented. Having stated thus much on the subject of a mistaken word, and the uses that have been made of it, I am ready to own fairly, that with respect to political principles, and the measures growing out of them, from the very first, I have been under great apprehension that we (his majesty's existing government) are very likely to differ among ourselves. Gentlemen talk of the measures and principles connected with our foreign and domestic policy; but these matters are not urfrequently made the subjects of much loose and vague declamation. I acknowledge that there are certain measures and principles, in relation to which it is necessary&#x2014;absolutely necessary&#x2014;to have an understanding, or it is impossible for a cabinet to agree: but it appears to me, that if a fair and distinct understanding subsist between the members of a government, as to general principles, that is sufficient. Sir, I do not know what people mean by talking of the principles of our domestic and foreign policy, except in so far as the application of principles relates to measures to be adopted, in regard to foreign and domestic affairs. Of the principles we never lose sight; but their application must mainly, if it does not entirely, depend on the nature of particular circumstances and events. If I may be allowed to illustrate the point by a reference to subjects which I introduced in the course of my speech at Liverpool, I will say, that the expedition to Portugal in the last year, and our recent interference in the affairs of Greece, form parts of our foreign policy during the last eighteen months; and grow not so much out of any general system, as they proceed from the effect of necessity operating under particular circumstances. With respect to measures of domestic policy, I will take the question of the silk trade. In reference to that branch of our manufacture, I thought it desirable to assimilate its condition to the condition of the other great branches of our trade. That was the application of a general principle to a particular case; but the hon. gentlemen, late members for Lincoln and Coventry (Mr. Williams and Mr. Ellice) but not now in the House, opposed the application of a principle (from which, I believe, they were not averse in the main) in this particular
<image src="S2V0018P0I0249"/>
<col>483</col>
instance. The hon. members, as I have already said, did not oppose the general principle, but its peculiar application as it regarded the silk trade. They not only considered the principle sound, but the measure in question judicious, if applied at a proper time. However, they contended that that was not the precise time for its introduction and application. The application of general principles, then, can only mean their application at the proper time, in reference to the existing circumstances of the country. When I say, that the general principles of our policy are not now altered, I may be allowed to refer to what my noble friend, at the head of the cabinet, has said in another place. Other gentlemen have quoted documents. I trust that I also may be permitted to do so. The noble duke says&#x2014;
<quote>"It cannot, of course, be forgotten, that I was a member of lord Liverpoool's cabinet, and that, in being so, I was a party to the greater part of the measures upon which it proposed to conduct the business of the present administration; that I concurred in those measures, and that, equally with others I share their full responsibility. How, thon. could I, with the least show of consistency&#x2014; the slightest regard for character&#x2014;depart from the maintenance and prosecution of measures to which I already stand pledged."</quote>
Sir, in these words I find a guarantee&#x2014; if there were none elsewhere&#x2014;of the noble duke's intention to maintain the established principles of our domestic and foreign policy. The noble duke supported the expedition to Portugal, and his signature is attached to the Protocol drawn up at St. Petersburg, on the subject of Greece. That Protocol bears his name, and involves his assent to our policy, in relation to the matter referred to, independently of the noble duke's verbal declaration to the same effect. Attempts have been made to insinuate the connection of the noble duke with the narrow and bigotted policy of other courts than our own, and to identify him with all that is reprehensible in the bad faith and insincerity of foreign politicians. In answer to these imputations, I refer the noble duke's calumniators to his own declarations and acts. These afford the best tests of his real views and principles. Sir, it is impossible to attack the principles of the present administration, without at the same time aspersing the character and
<col>484</col>
measures of the late administrations. I again refer to the conduct of the noble duke now at the head of the cabinet, on the subject of Portugal. It should be recollected that when that undertaking was questioned in parliament, the noble duke had vindicated it in his place in the other House. The imputation, then, of illiberality in the duke of Wellington, and the charge of inconsistency brought against myself for taking office under him, are alike unfounded.<lb/>
Sir, I feel it to be really impossible, notwithstanding the call made upon me by the noble lord, to enter into a narrative of all the explanations and understandings that have taken place between me and the noble duke at the head of the cabinet, previous to my accepting the office which I have now the honour to hold. Observations, charging me with inconsistency in the discharge of my public duty, have been levelled against my character in various ways. To take one of many instances&#x2014; the appointment of the Finance Committee&#x2014;I have been accused of abandoning my principles on that question. But how does the case stand? In several interviews which I had with the noble duke and in the course of which we discussed together the various topics connected with the formation and operation of the existing government, it accidentally escaped my attention to ask a question relative to the Finance Committee. When the subject occurred to me, I was at the moment confined to my room by indisposition, and I wrote to the noble duke for the purpose of ascertaining his feelings and sentiments on the subject. I hold in my hand the noble duke's written answer to that communication&#x2014;it is perfectly and entirely satisfactory. Let persons say what they will of a pledge&#x2014;a stipulation&#x2014;or a guarantee, I call the communication in question by none of these names&#x2014;it is simply a question asked on my part and an answer given by the noble duke&#x2014;but no bond was required.<lb/>
I again say, Sir, call it what you will, pledge, stipulation, or guarantee&#x2014;I fearlessly ask whether, in this particular instance, the Finance Committee, nominated on Friday evening by my right hon. friend, the Home Secretary, has not in its construction&#x2014; in the principles of economy that may be expected to proceed from its members&#x2014;and in the investigation which it will, doubtless, be enabled to make into
<image src="S2V0018P0I0250"/>
<col>485</col>
the income and expenditure of the country &#x2014;I fearlessly ask whether, in all these particulars, it does not appear, that the present government have fully, honourably, and completely, redeemed its pledge? If you call this a pledge, it is a pledge that has been completely and entirely redeemed.<lb/>
Sir, I have exhausted myself and the House on the subject of explanations. I have given a statement with respect to what passed at Liverpool, and hon. members, I trust, are satisfied. Having made this statement, I now declare, that I will not be compelled ever again to reiterate it, or to return to the subject by any means which may be selected to force me to do so. There is one more point to which I am desirous of adverting before I sit down. A question has been put to me in another place, where it is impossible that I could answer it. The question to which I allude is this&#x2014;whether I had not declared, that I never would consent to form part of an administration, of which the duke of Wellington or my right hon. friend near me (Mr. Peel) were members? Sir, I most unequivocally, positively, and distinctly, deny, that I ever did make such a declaration. Looking to the quarter whence this question has been put&#x2014;respecting, as I do, the feelings of filial piety that dictated it&#x2014;and revering with an almost equal degree of piety, the memory of him whose fame the feeling that dictated that question was mistakenly intended to protect&#x2014; I say no more upon a subject like the present, than to express my opinion, that matters so entirely and purely of a private nature as this, are not fit to undergo a public discussion in parliament. This, which is my firm conviction, in addition to the place and manner in which the question was put, renders it unnecessary for me to add another word. Sir, I am well aware that the necessary consequence of the course of policy I have adopted, and the natural result of the principles I have long been in the habit of advocating, is to expose my character to obloquy, and my motives to misrepresentation, by two opposite classes of the community. That part of it which consider all improvement as dangerous innovation, are naturally opposed to me. That other portion of the public which, looking only at abstract principles, never allow for the existence and effect of artificial difficulties, and which always overlook the obstacles that stand in the way of the application of those prin
<col>486</col>
ciples&#x2014;whether those obstacles grow out of the existing state of society, its established feelings, or (if you will) its honest but unwise prejudices, this part also are hostile to a moderate and practical reformer. I have endeavoured to steer a middle course, and I know that I have been despised and censured by the zealots of both; but, as long as I shall have the honour to retain a seat in this House&#x2014;as long as I shall have a place in his majesty's councils&#x2014;so long shall I, through good report and evil report, pursue the course which I have hitherto pursued, and adhere to the principles which have hitherto formed my guide of action. As long as I act in this manner, and upon these principles, I shall expect to receive from the friends who surround me, and also from the House at large, that which I have hitherto received with satisfaction and gratitude, I mean their support and approbation to the measures which I have suggested; but if my friends should, unfortunately, take a different view of the public interests from that which my judgment and my information, such as they may be, suggest to my mind, my duty is clear, and I know what course I have to take. I have ever held, and I now hold, that a public man is not at liberty to reject the call of his sovereign for his services, so long as there is nothing in the mode and nature of that call, which is derogatory from his personal honour or inconsistent with his public principles. It was because I felt that sentiment in its fullest force, that I acceded to the call which his majesty did me the honour of making upon me. I feel honoured far beyond my deserts, by the confidence which my sovereign shows that he reposes in me, by calling me to the high situation which it is now my pride to fill. I feel honoured, too, by the support which I have received, on all occasions, from this House, and by the approbation which I have met with from a great part of this enlightened and opulent country. So honoured, I seek no other honour; I have no further personal ambition to gratify; I have no further honour to acquire; and I say, without the slightest disguise or reservation, that if, with increasing business and diminished health, and with the natural desire for tranquillity and repose which comes upon all of us at a certain period of life, I find that I cannot enjoy that confidence which is so necessary to the proper execution of the duties of my
<image src="S2V0018P0I0251"/>
<col>487</col>
office, I shall certainly act upon the admonition of my private feelings; I shall not be slow to seek retirement, but shall be most happy to let the noble duke now at the head of the government place the seals of my department in abler and more efficient hands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00334"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;I rise, Sir, with the most unfeigned embarrassment, and with the most unqualified sense of the difficulty of the task, to address the House. I have no intention of entering into so large an explanation as that into which my right hon. friend has entered, for circumstances do not call upon me to do so; but I feel myself bound to obey the call which the House has made upon me, and to offer an explanation on some part of my public conduct which appears to some individuals to be compromised in certain important transactions which have recently taken place. Under ordinary circumstances I should certainly feel inclined to except to such a call; but as it involves consequences most important to my character, both as a public man and a private individual, I am inclined to depart from the rule which I would lay down for the general guidance of public men, and to offer an explanation, which, after all, is an explanation which affects two private individuals rather than the public at large. I hold, that to make lightly such disclosures as I am now imperatively called upon to make, is a most pernicious practice to which public men ought not to submit; inasmuch as appeals to the public can never be made by public men, without their suffering a diminution of respect in the minds of the people of the country. I think it necessary to say thus much as a justification for myself in making a statement which bears a relation to certain recent transactions in the cabinet. Such statements, in addition to their tendency to lower, in the general estimation, those who make them, are productive of this further evil, that they have a tendency to sow among those between whom concord, harmony, and union should prevail, if the business of the public is to be faithfully and efficaciously discharged, sentiments of discord and disunion, and to perpetuate in their breasts feelings of mistrust and jealousy, which are as injurious to the public, as they are painful to the individuals who entertain them.<lb/>
Sir, there are two points on which I understand it is indispensably necessary for roe to offer an explanation. However,
<col>488</col>
before I proceed further, I must express my surprise at some circumstances which I have learned this night, for the first time, from the speech of my right hon. friend, who has just sat down. There are circumstances of great importance relating to the transactions which my right hon. friend has detailed to the House,&#x2014;circumstances, too, relating to my own conduct and that of my right hon. friend,&#x2014; which have been made known to me now for the first time this night. To those circumstances I shall come in the course of my speech, after I have detailed to the House the transactions to which I have referred, as they are known to myself and to several gentlemen whom I have now the honour of addressing. The accusation, if so I may call it, which is laid at my door with reference to these transactions and to the dissolution of the late cabinet, is in its nature two-fold. First of all it is stated, that owing to the difference of opinion which had sprung up between my right hon. friend and myself, I was the principal cause of the dissolution of the late cabinet. Now, that may not be a great imputation on any man; for individuals are sometimes compelled to take a part in circumstances over which they have no control, and are thus obliged to create divisions, which, of their own free will, they would have been the foremost to deprecate, and the most anxious to avoid. It does not therefore follow that&#x2014;supposing it to be true that I was the cause of the dissolution of the late cabinet, which I beg leave most positively to deny&#x2014;I am liable, to any blame upon that account. In passing, however, I will take the opportunity of saying, that I shall hereafter prove that I was not the cause of its dissolution. But, as it has been insinuated, that I so conducted my department of the government as to give impartial men reason to believe that there was a deliberate and premeditated desire on ray part to produce that effect, I will meet the insinuation with a direct and positive contradiction. I will not blink the charge which has been brought against me. I will state the insinuation to my discredit in its fullest and broadest extent; for, in all cases, where charges are made in the shape of insinuations, the fairest, the simplest, the most honourable, nay, the safest, way of dealing with them, is to state the insinuation in the utmost length to which it can, be carried in the shape of accusation
<image src="S2V0018P0I0252"/>
<col>489</col>
&#x2014;to grapple with it afterwards as a distinct accusation&#x2014;and then to give it as distinct and overwhelming a refutation. That is the proper way of dealing with blind hints and dark surmises. I therefore repeat once more, that there is no truth whatever in the allegation, that the difference which sprung up between my right hon. colleague and myself was the cause of the dissolution of the late cabinet. I say, that in all the rumours which have been propagated, about design, and artifice, and stratagem, &#x2014;a supposition, by-the-by, which involves the blackest charges against me; for it imputes to me a treacherous communication with some parties out of the cabinet of which I was a member,&#x2014;-there is not one word of truth. I deny them most unequivocally. They are false and unfounded in every particular, and have not even the slightest shadow of a foundation.<lb/>
I will first simply detail to the House my situation with respect to the Finance Committee, and will then call upon it to draw from my detail such inferences as they may suppose just and natural. I will confess, that I had certainly occupied myself very closely with that project, which I conceived to be one of paramount importance, in the present state of our financial concerns. I will now state that which, perhaps, is not known to every person who hears me&#x2014;that that same Finance Committee, from which we all expect so many useful and important results, was originally proposed by me to the right hon. gentleman, who, at the time of his death, filled the situation of first lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. It had been previously laid before the government which preceded that of Mr. Canning; but I believe that, even in that case, I have a right to say, that the proposition came from myself. I mention this circumstance merely to show, that I had a deep interest, and an anxious feeling, in the successful execution of that which I may be permitted to look upon as my own substantive proposition. It did not come to me as an indifferent proposition. I was anxious that it should be rendered in the highest degree productive of all the public benefits of which I was sure it might be made productive, if it were properly car-lied into execution.<lb/>
My right hon. friend has this night stated to the House, that for some time, about the middle of November last, he was in communication with two of my colleagues on
<col>490</col>
he subject of the appointment of chairman for the committee of finance; first, with the noble lord who was at the head of the government, and next with a right hon. gentleman whom I have in my eye, and who, at that time, held the office which I have now the honour to fill. My right hon. friend has stated his regret, that those communications were not forwarded to me, in whose department matters of that kind are generally settled, and he has likewise added, that the occasion on which those communications were first made known to me was an occasion specifically appointed by himself for that purpose. I am convinced that my right hon. friend has mentioned correctly that which was the impression on his own mind, but I feel bound to say, that the occasion on which I first heard of those communications was one on which a casual circumstance had taken me to the office of my right hon. friend. When I first called there my right hon. friend was not within. I therefore left word that I wished to see him on business, at the earliest opportunity. Shortly afterwards, my right hon. friend sent to me to say, that he should be happy to see me at his office. In consequence of that message, I went to my right hon. friend, but under the impression that I was to see him upon the business for which I originally sought him. In the course of that interview I was told, that it had been suggested, I do not know by whom, that lord Althorp should be appointed chairman of the proposed Finance Committee. That proposition was new to me, it was the first time I had ever deemed it necessary to think of a person for the chairman. I had not negociated on the subject. I had received numberless applications from different persons upon the subject; some of whom thought that I, from my official situation should be placed in the chair. To all such applications I had either refused to give an answer; or, if I did give an answer, I had replied, that I could not and would not give any information, as to who was, or who was not to be, the chairman of the committee. I now call upon my right hon. friend to do me the justice to state, that when mention was first made to me of the intention to place lord Althorp in the chair, I said, that with all the respect which I bore for the high private character of that noble lord, and with all the satisfaction which I should experience in acting with him on any committee, I must object
<image src="S2V0018P0I0253"/>
<col>491</col>
to his being appointed chairman of this committee. Such was the answer which I gave to a communication which I by no means considered at the time to be so distinct, as I afterwards discovered that it was intended to be. The right hon. gentleman who then filled the office of Master of the Mint, came into the room after the conversation began; and he, too, adverted to the subject of the Finance Committee, The conversation which then ensued upon it was not long; but it turned more on the I object to which the labours of the committee were to be directed, than to the names of the persons who were to be put upon it, or to the individual who was to act as its chairman. The interview was terminated by the intervention of another person, and, as I have before stated, did not continue any considerable time. On leaving the office of my right hon. friend, I went to my own house; and when I got there, I reflected on the communication which had just been made to me. Some doubts then suggested themselves to me as to the propriety of the course which was proposed to be pursued. I wrote in consequence to the noble lord who was then at the head of the government, requesting an immediate interview with him upon the subject of it. My noble friend could not grant me the interview which I requested, on that day; but appointed a meeting for the next morning at ten o'clock. At that hour I waited on my noble friend, and with a declaration of my regret&#x2014;first, that any step had been taken on a subject on which the step taken was not likely to lead to success; secondly, that the steps taken had not been better adapted to promote the benefits which ought to be derived from the appointment of the committee; and lastly, not confining myself to the objections which I had to the appointment upon principle, with a strong remonstrance upon the slighting manner in which I had been treated throughout the whole transaction. The House will see that it was quite impossible for me entirely to lose sight, in this explanation, of every thing which had taken place previously to that communication having been made to me. There is not a single individual whom I have the honour to address, in whose recollection the circumstances will not be fresh, which took place before my accession to the office of chancellor of the Exchequer; not one, in whose recollection they are
<col>492</col>
fresh, who will not perceive, that those very circumstances made it, and could not but make it, unavoidable that I should be peculiarly jealous to maintain the dignity and character attached to my situation. It cannot have escaped the memory of the House that there were individuals who had made themselves so conspicuous in opposing my appointment to office, as to render any interference on their part against me a thing which I could not, as a man of honour, submit to for a moment. It was, however, more from reflection than from the impulse of the moment&#x2014;for my feelings are not in general of an irritable nature&#x2014;that I was induced to think seriously of the objection which I had started to the appointment of the noble lord; and after reflection, without consulting with any person&#x2014;a point which, in this instance, is most essentially material&#x2014;I repaired to the noble lord at the head of the government, and represented to him all the objections, public as well as personal (and the public objections were extremely strong), which had occurred to me with regard to the proposition which had been made to me on the previous day. I am bound in candour to state, that my noble friend expressed to me his sincere regret at what had taken place; that he received the communication I then made to him with considerable agitation;&#x2014;that he admitted that a wrong had been done me which ought to be repaired; and that no time ought to be lost in obviating the objections which I had so frankly and so fairly stated. There were witnesses present&#x2014;one of them I see at this moment in the House&#x2014;who can state distinctly in what manner my objections were urged upon lord Goderich, and in what manner they were received by him.<lb/>
After my interview with lord Goderich, I lost no time in again seeing my right hon. friend, in order that I might communicate to him, in the strongest terms possible, the powerful objections which I felt to the appointment of lord Althorp as chairman of the committee. That interview, though I sought it at an early hour, did not take place till late in the day. In consequence of that circumstance, I drew up a letter to my right hon. friend before I went to him. Whilst I was finishing it, I received information from my right hon. friend, that he had returned to his office and was anxious to see me. I went to the right hon. gentleman, and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0254"/>
<col>493</col>
whilst I was with him, stated some of the public and general, as well as some of the private and personal, objections to which the choice of lord Althorp, as chairman of the committee, was inevitably exposed. On my return from that interview, feeling that it was necessary for me to do something more than merely lodge a protest against that choice, I concluded the letter which I had previously drawn up, and enclosed it in another to my right hon. friend, stating that I had sent to him the letter which I had told him at the last interview that I had composed, as my written protest against conferring the powers of chairman of the Finance Committee upon lord Althorp. Sir, I received from my right hon. friend, not on that day but on the next, an answer, which I considered perfectly satisfactory. It was such an answer as I should have expected to receive from my right hon. friend. It contained an expression of his regret, that he and my noble friend should have unintentionally done any thing of which I thought I had a right to complain. My right hon. friend likewise stated his reasons for acting as he had done, and sent me a letter, which he said he had written to my right hon. colleague, the Master of the Mint, in the nature of a request or injunction, that no further proceedings should be taken for the present as to the Finance Committee, and that great caution should be used in making any communication as to the names of its members or its intended chairman.<lb/>
Sir, in this situation the matter rested for some time, when my right hon. friend showed me a letter which he said that he had received from the right hon. the Master of the Mint, disclaiming having gone so far as my right hon. friend appeared to suppose, and explaining, without any equivocation or draw-back, how far he had really gone. I am sure the House will agree with me in thinking, that at this period of the transaction, I had a right to conclude that nothing further would be done in it, without some communication with me. I had explained&#x2014;I had protested&#x2014;I had objected&#x2014; nay, I had done more&#x2014;I had explained the grounds of my objection in writing. I had not said "I dislike this or that man for such and such private reasons;" I had not alleged any personal or peculiar pique against the noble chairman; I had adopted nothing but public grounds as the grounds
<col>494</col>
of my opposition. Having made my objection openly and fairly, having lodged my protest, both verbally and in writing, having received an assurance, that there was no intention on the part of either my noble or my right hon. friend, to offer an affront to me, or to interfere unduly with my office, and having received assurances from both my friends that the proceedings in the transaction were, if I may use such an expression, stayed, I was justified in suffering the matter to rest, without entering into any further communications. After the various assurances I had received on the subject, I was of opinion that I might wait until some further communication was made to me on the subject; and I likewise thought, that it was more fitting that a communication on such a subject should be made to me than that it should come from me. I must now, however, inform the House, that within three or four days after I had received the assurances to which I have just alluded, there commenced a series of proceedings, which led to the abdication&#x2014; should I call it? or the disappearance of the head of the government&#x2014;nay, to the very abeyance of the government itself,&#x2014; and then to the subsequent mysterious restoration of it to its previous head, on the 19th of December. On the 20th, the government was again perfected: and now I will ask, whether my noble friend would have thought it either just, or fair, or prudent, or decorous, in me, whilst the government was in its agony, or I may rather say in its dissolution&#x2014;would not my noble friend have thought it most unkind and unfeeling, and I will even add absurd, for me to have mooted, at such a time, such a question as who was to be chairman of the Finance Committee? Can any blame attach to me for having suspended my proceedings on such a question, from the 2nd of December to the 22nd, and not, as my right hon. friends had stated, the 26th, considering all that had passed in the interval? Have I not accounted for any apparent delay on my part, in what I have stated; namely, that there was not in that interval any day, except the 3rd, or the 4th, or the 5th, in which it was possible for me, without being guilty of an ill-timed obtrusion, to have renewed my communication respecting the Finance Committee? To whom, in that interval, could I have addressed any communication? How could I have worded
<image src="S2V0018P0I0255"/>
<col>495</col>
it? How could I have begun it? No government was in existence; but as soon as there was, and as the day was drawing near when it would become necessary to bring the subject of the Finance Committee before parliament, I took the first opportunity that presented itself; and, the very day after the restoration of the government, I addressed a letter to the noble lord at its head, and that letter I will now read to the House. The House will observe, that this was done to guard myself from all misunderstanding, being sensible, from all that had passed, that there was an intention, which I will not refer to more particularly, because it does not belong to my justification, but which proved to my conviction, that the nomination already made was to be supported. There may be some present who know more about the transaction than I do. I had no official communication on the subject; and I therefore speak as a person perfectly uninformed. Under these circumstances, I thought it right that my communication with the head of the government should state precisely how I stood with respect to the Finance Committee. The letter is in these terms:&#x2014;
<quote>"21st Dec, 1827.</quote>
<quote>"My dear Goderich;&#x2014;It is now full time that some further steps should be taken with respect to the committee of finance.</quote>
<quote>"It would, I believe, naturally be my duty to bring that subject under the consideration of the Cabinet; but after what has passed (and I advert to it with much pain), I feel that it is not at present in my hands. I must, therefore, learn from you, as head of the government, what is the course intended to be pursued for the formation of this committee, and the regulation of its proceedings.</quote>
<quote>"What has hitherto been done in this matter has taken place without consultation or communication with me, although it would seem to belong principally to my department of the public business. A negotiation has been carried on, and completed by Mr. Tierney, with your sanction and that of Mr. Huskisson, for the nomination of the chairman of the committee. The government is, I presume, fully committed to the individual fixed upon for the purpose, and to the noble House, of which he is a member; and this proceeding, as I am given to understand, has been adopted with a view, in a great measure,
<col>496</col>
to a political object, and as being calculated to strengthen the hands of the administration. I doubt much whether that view be correct, and whether the calculation be a just one. But I have an objection to the arrangement upon a much higher ground. I conceive, that in order to derive in the utmost possible degree from this important measure all the public benefit which it is capable of affording, and at the same time to avoid the inconveniences to which it is liable, all political views&#x2014;views of the narrower kind&#x2014;all those which are connected with particular parties and influences only, should be utterly discarded in the formation of the committee. It appears to me, that these objects would be best secured if the committee were composed of the most eminent individuals of the several parties in the House of Commons, and the chair filled by some person of high character and respectability, either entirely unconnected, or connected as little as possible, with any of the political parties into which the House is divided.</quote>
<quote>"Whether this be a proper view of the subject, and whether, if it be so, you could yet proceed upon such a principle, you are best able to judge. I do not feel that I could act in it upon any other. In order, therefore, to relieve you from any difficulty, as connected with my situation, respecting the course which you may deem it expedient to pursue, I beg to assure you, that if by putting my office into other hands you can more satisfactorily execute this difficult measure, you may command my most ready and cheerful resignation of it. I place it (and I beg it to be understood as being done in the most friendly manner) entirely at your disposal."</quote>
<quote>Now, I ask, was there any thing in this letter calculated to defeat the object of the committee&#x2014;to embarrass the proceedings of the government&#x2014;or to push matters to that extreme which defied all possibility of arrangement? It was competent to the noble lord to deny any thing which I had assumed as fact, if the noble lord had reason to believe that I was mistaken. It was competent to the noble lord to object to any principle which I had laid down, if the noble lord was prepared to contend that such principle was erroneous. Nothing can be more obvious than this&#x2014;if the principle was not sound, I might, I ought, to have been told so; and the other principle, whatever it might be, to which a preference was given in the cabinet, dis-

<col>497</col>
tinctly asserted. But no such denial was given, no such assertion was made; but, on the contrary, a declaration on the part of the noble lord, that I was mistaken, in (a great degree, as to the part which I supposed the noble lord to have taken in the transaction. The answer of my noble friend was as follows:&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>"My dear Herries;&#x2014;I received your letter of the 21st, and I agree with you, that the time is at hand when it will become necessary to consider the direction of the Finance Committee in all its bearings, with a view to the public good, and the satisfaction of all parties. When Mr. Huskisson returns to town, this matter must be brought to a final issue. I owe it, however, to myself to say, that you have greatly misconceived the degree in which I was a party to the nomination of lord Althorp to fill the chair of that committee. I thought I had sufficiently explained to you verbally, that I conceived the communication to be nothing more than casual, and I regret that it was made. When Mr. Tierney suggested to me the appointment of lord Althorp, I said it was a proposition that ought to be well considered; but, from my regard for the individual, and my old friendship towards him, I was disposed towards it. The matter ended here. When Mr. Tierney afterwards mentioned the circumstance again, I said, that if the members of the House of Commons inclined to his nomination, I should not object; but that it could not be acted on without a consultation with the government. When I subsequently understood from Mr. Huskisson, that a sort of communication had been made to lord Althorp on the subject, my first inquiry was, as to whether you had been spoken to on the subject, and to my great surprise, I was given to understand you never had. I then thought it right to state, that you were a party to whom direct reference should be made. With respect to the latter part of your letter, in which you place your office in my hands, I cannot conceive that you have made out a case to justify you in so proceeding; but I hope that you will take no steps until an opportunity has been given for bringing the whole matter under full consideration."</quote>
Sir, I read this letter to show that, in fact, no answer was given to the objections made in my communication to the noble lord. On the terms I had there stated, I was ready to continue to hold office; and
<col>498</col>
the only step I had then taken had been that of putting my resignation conditionally into the hands of lord Goderich, if he thought that, by means of that resignation, he could better carry on the business of his government. I come now to a circumstance of greater importance. The next communication was of a personal nature between the noble lord and myself. This took place on the 29th of December; and on that day he mentioned my communication to him, and requested to know from me distinctly, whether I had made up my mind to resign my situation if lord Althorp was appointed chairman of the committee? I answered that my resignation was not fairly required of me&#x2014;that I had not offered to resign&#x2014;but that the grounds on which I proposed to conduct the business of my office had been fully stated in my letter to him, and that it was for him to determine whether he would make use of the offer I had there made, in the event of his wishing to arrange the proceedings of the government in a different manner. My communication, however, never received the slightest attention: there was not even an approach to an adjustment, by a discussion of the merits of the subject, and I was not informed whether the further arrangement was to be left to the opening of parliament, or any other period. I was only asked, whether I intended to resign? My answer to that question was, "look to my letter, and you will there see the grounds on which you must determine whether I do resign or not." But, if I had been informed at that time, that my right hon. friend, at the same time and on the same ground as that of the appointment of the chairman of the Finance Committee, had tendered his resignation, the case might have been very-different. I was left in utter ignorance of that circumstance. It was not until I saw the letter of the 5th of January, that I learned, for the first time, he had made a point of that kind, and had spoken of his resignation in consequence of the difference upon the subject. I positively declare, that up to that moment I knew nothing of the tender of his resignation. In the course of the communication between me and the noble lord, it was never once mentioned that the matter was not, as I supposed it to be, quite concluded; it was never intimated, that no engagement had been entered into, which was not considered as absolutely binding upon the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0257"/>
<col>499</col>
parties. My answer to the noble lord's letter was to this effect: "If the matter be as you represent it&#x2014;if it be still open to discussion, let us consider it." But I was told in reply, that though the question was not closed by any positive pledge, yet that there was an understanding that it must be so considered, and that it was, therefore, no longer open to discussion. I would put it, then, to any man of honour and feeling, if he had been placed in my situation, what else could he have done but what I did? I was told, on the one hand, that as nothing was formally concluded, I had no just ground for resigning; and, on the other hand, while I was thus told that nothing was formally concluded, I was also told, that the matter was not open to discussion. I could not consent to hold office upon such conditions. I again referred to my former letter, and in order to illustrate what I felt on the subject, to shew likewise the absence of every thing like paltry and ungentleman-like feeling on my part towards my right hon. friend; and to convince the House that I acted, in this instance, on the same principle on which I have always proceeded, both as concerns my own feelings and the public service, I will read the last letter which passed between myself and the noble lord. I had seen him shortly before, and a conversation had taken place nearly to the same effect as our letters. In answer to some questions of the same kind as those he had written to me, such as, Do you persist in resigning, if this appointment be made? I did undoubtedly say, "Look at my letter." I added, "if any thing now be proposed, I am ready to consider it; I will hear what you have to bring forward, but if you merely ask me, whether I adhere to my resolution, I certainly answer I do." Notwithstanding these reiterated declarations verbally, of my determination to adhere to the resolution I had on mature deliberation adopted, my noble friend still pressed me to depart from it. He sent me another letter, to which, within half an hour, I returned this answer:&#x2014;
<quote>"Jan. 7, 1828.</quote>
<quote>"My Dear Goderich:&#x2014; I have as you requested in your last letter (and as I promised in my answer that I would), carefully reconsidered the subject of my letter of the 21st of December. I regret to be compelled to state, that the reconsideration. so bestowed upon it has not con
<col>500</col>
duced to any alteration of the judgment which I had previously formed and communicated to you. The question at issue, and upon which your judgment, not mine, is to be formed, is obviously not the mere nomination of lord Althorp. That nomination cannot be treated as an insulated point, disconnected from the circumstances under which it was determined upon, and the manner in which it was settled; nor (which is of much more importance) can it be fairly considered without reference to the principles by which I have stated that I think every step in the formation of the committee of finance ought to be guided. In your last communication to me, you gave me to understand that I had been mistaken in supposing that a conclusive engagement with lord Althorp had been made. It appears from your view of the matter, that little more had been done than to ascertain that lord Althorp would undertake the office. If such be the case, I cannot but observe that it renders the positive determination to adhere peremptorily to that choice, and even to refuse all discussion of the reasons upon which I think a different course ought to be pursued, not only more unintelligible to me, but more difficult for me to acquiesce in. I should have thought that it might, upon such grounds, have still been an open question. Let me take this opportunity of renewing the assurance which I have already given you, that your determination, as the result of your judgment in this matter, to advise the king to confide to other hands the seals which I now hold, will not have the slightest tendency to diminish the friendship which I feel both for you and for Huskisson; nor to abate the sincere wishes which I entertain for the future success of your administration. I feel that where parties of such unequal weights are placed, by an unfortunate concurrence of circumstances, in two opposite scales, there ought not to be a moment's hesitation (with reference to the interests of the government) in so diposing of me as to retain the invaluable services of our common friend."</quote>
Surely, Sir, the House will agree with me, that this was not a letter written in the spirit of a man who wished to injure, much less to overturn the government to which he belonged. But it was my clear conviction, that I could not abandon this part of the duty of my department, under these circumstances, without making a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0258"/>
<col>501</col>
sacrifice, not only of public principle&#x2014;but of the respect due to personal character, which nothing on earth should induce me to do. And here I feel myself called upon most; distinctly to disclaim having ever entertained any personal objection to the appointment of the noble lord opposite, whose high and estimable qualities I admire as much as any of his friends. My right hon. friend, I perceive, bears testimony to what I say regarding my respect for the noble lord's talents and accomplishments. There is no point on which I am more anxious to set myself right than this. I repeat, that so far from standing on any personal objection to the noble lord, I should have had much satisfaction in transacting business with him as chairman of the committee, from the esteem in which I held his character, if I had considered his appointment to that situation consistent with that principle, the soundness of which I have never heard disputed in this House. To the letter I have just read, I received no answer. The principle on which I objected to the noble lord's appointment, and I admit I objected to it strongly, was one, I repeat, which I have never heard disputed. It was wholly independent of any thing of a personal nature. I had stated my opinion, that to render the committee as important and useful as possible, it should be composed of persons in the least degree connected with party. This rule seemed to me to apply, in a particular manner, to the chairman of the committee, who will have to hold the balance impartially on a subject, as to which the House is divided into so many, and such various opinions. It appeared to me infinitely better to choose any other person than one who, if not the leader, was at least prominent among the leaders of a party; and I think this objection must, on reflection, be readily admitted. On some of the points likely to come under the consideration of the committee, the noble lord would probably have found himself pledged by his previous and repeated declarations in the strongest manner. Would not that circumstance alone render the noble lord, however estimable his talents and character, less eligible than one not so pledged and not so predetermined? There is one point as to which the public will look with much anxiety, indeed I may say with intense anxiety, to the proceedings of this committee. Many members of this House attach the
<col>502</col>
highest importance to the maintenance of a sinking fund, and there are many, I know, who treat it as an idle and useless incumbrance. I will not on this occasion enter into that question; but I may say, in passing, that the sinking fund has, I believe, no enemy more hostile, than the noble lord. For my own part, I feel deeply the importance of having a real surplus of revenue applicable to the reduction of the debt. It can hardly fail to happen, that, among the subjects that will come across that committee, this should not be one; and I do think it is one on which the noble lord is rather disqualified from sitting as the chairman. He is irrevocably pledged upon it. I recollect some of his speeches, to which I listened at the time with the greatest attention; and I am sure that any hon. gentleman who has attended to the noble lord's conduct for some years past, cannot have failed to perceive that he is decidedly hostile to the principle of a sinking fund. I considered that this sort of positive declaration, on points of deep importance, rendered the noble lord less eligible, however able in other respects, for that particular situation, than if he had not been so pledged. This was one of the reasons why I felt myself justified in opposing the appointment of the noble lord; and there were others which, though of some importance, I will not advert to at present. Generally, however, I will say, that the noble lord was too prominent a member of one of the extreme parties of the state, if I may use the expression, to become the most eligible chairman under all the circumstances.<lb/>
Sir, I have, I hope, satisfactorily explained to the House the course which I felt it my duty to pursue on the occasion so often alluded to. I have, I hope, satisfied their minds so as to remove every doubt they may have harboured, that no unnecessary delay has taken place upon my part, in making the communication between the two periods, and that all the unworthy suspicions whispered abroad as to motives will no longer be found to exist. I hope that no idea will be any longer entertained of attributing to me any thing like a design to embarrass the government at a particular crisis. I have accounted for the delay. I have stated how my application was received, and how willing I was to discuss the subject. I have stated what was also most material, my ignorance of the intended resignation of my right hon.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0259"/>
<col>503</col>
friend. From these facts, I am obliged to draw this conclusion; namely, that certain circumstances had shaken the government to its foundation before the 21st, when I wrote the letter I have read to the House, nay, had led to its dissolution before that time; but of which, to my extreme surprise and very deep regret, my noble friend in another place, in giving his account of the causes of that dissolution, omitted to make any mention. I say that circumstances were known before the 21st, to those connected with the government, which made them foresee the dissolution that was about to take place. I further say, that this letter and proceeding of mine was taken advantage of, as a convenient opportunity for doing that which sooner or later must have happened [hear, hear]. I say that I know it was so taken advantage of. I say that I know it was discussed, whether my letter should not be made use of in the manner it has been, [hear, hear], I will speak out plainly in my own defence. Sink or swim, I will defend my honour. With all the respect I entertain for lord Goderich&#x2014;with all my friendship for him&#x2014;I must, when his conduct, by an unfortunate concurrence of circumstances, calls my character and honour in question, defend myself in the best manner my situation will allow me. I say then that no minister could take such a trifling fact as this&#x2014;such a paltry subject of difficulty as this&#x2014;to the foot of the throne, and leave it there as a difficulty and embarrassment, unaccompanied by any advice as to the removal of it, without virtually giving in his own resignation of office at the same time [cheering]. I hope I have not, in the warmth of debate, infringed upon the rule I laid down for myself at starting; for I think that a man connected with government ought to be cautious that he does not, in making his defence, declare more than is strictly and absolutely necessary for that purpose. I hope the House will think that I have not said more than is necessary for that purpose. But I feel that if I were to pursue this subject further, I should transgress the limits I have imposed on myself, and which I hold it a sacred obligation not to pass.<lb/>
My vindication, then, I will confine to two points. First, that my conduct was not the cause of the dissolution of the ministry; and secondly, that throughout the whole transaction there was not a part of it which
<col>504</col>
evinced a design to effect that object. It will require very little evidence to prove the impossibility of such having been my design; indeed, in my opinion, it wants no evidence that any man's common sense will not furnish him with. It is from the exercise of that common sense that the whole country has come to the conclusion of the impossibility of my having effected what has been attributed to me. An individual is recently introduced into the government, under circumstances to which I will not advert further, than by saying, that great objections were raised to his introduction, and three months after, on his offering his resignation, that mere circumstance is alleged to have dissolved the cabinet. Is it possible that any man can believe such a thing? It is absurd upon the very face of it: and yet this is the very case that is now imagined.<lb/>
There is one other subject to which I wish to call the attention of the House before I close, what I conceive to be a complete vindication of my conduct and character on this occasion. It has been pretended, in some unworthy insinuations thrown out against me, not only that I designedly managed my resignation, so as to produce the effect it is asserted to have produced, but that I did it in consequence of some communications between myself and other parties. It has been stated, in some of the public papers, that I have had communication with parties out of the government on this question&#x2014;that is, with reference to persons who were in office I before the late dissolution. It has even been hinted that I have held communication on the subject with the very highest personage in the state. Now, I declare, upon my word of honour as a gentleman, and as I hope to be saved, that I have never had any communication with any individual on this question, out of the circle of my own colleagues. I declare that I have received no advice from any man, nor did I, on my word of honour&#x2014;my right hon. friend near me advises me not to speak on the subject, but I think it right and fit I should speak&#x2014; nor did I, on my word of honour, make the least communication in the high quarter alluded to; nor do I believe that any of the passing circumstances were known there until they were made known by my noble friend. That I believe; but with respect to myself, I can solemnly affirm, that there exists not the shadow of a reason for the insinuation, that has been
<image src="S2V0018P0I0260"/>
<col>505</col>
thrown out against me on that point. I have now nothing more to trouble the House with&#x2014;nothing but to thank it for the patience and kindness with which they have listened to me [loud cheers].</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00335"><member>Mr. Tierney</member><membercontribution> said, he felt it necessary to observe in answer to what had fallen from his right hon. friend, who had alluded to him as wishing formally to originate a debate of this kind, that he had harboured no such intention, that he had felt no desire to bring a charge against any one. But, knowing that explanations would be called for, and feeling anxious to be present when the subject was brought forward, he merely asked his right hon. friend on what day he would take his seat, as it would be inconvenient for him to attend on the Friday, as he was about to go to Brighton. This he told his right hon. friend; but as to originating any debate, he had not the least idea of doing so.&#x2014;He should now state a very few facts to the House, facts with which he was intimately connected. The matter had been brought to such a pitch by the two right hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House, I that it might appear malicious in him if he did not come forward. Part of what they had advanced was accurately stated; but their statement was not altogether accurate. It was perfectly true that, early in the month of November, he did suggest to his noble friend, lord Goderich, the propriety of nominating another noble friend, lord Althorp, to the situation of chairman in the Finance Committee. He had taken this step solely for the purpose of strengthening the government; for he thought it a matter of great importance that, in an inquiry of so extensive a nature, they should avail themselves of the assistance of one of the most respectable and intelligent noblemen in the kingdom. Now, when the right hon. gentleman, who spoke last, said, that he should have selected for that situation a person who was not of any party, he begged leave to observe, that he had done so; for the noble lord had never given in his adhesion to the late government; he had never declared that he would support it; all he had said was, that, if the measures proposed by that government met his views, then he would afford it his assistance. The answer of lord Goderich to this suggestion was, that he thought most highly of lord Althorp; that in the early part of his life, he was in habits of intimacy with that nobleman, and that nothing would
<col>506</col>
give him greater pleasure than to see lord Althorp appointed chairman of the committee; but he added, "This is a matter that more concerns you of the House of Commons; consult with the leader in that House, the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies, and what he decides on, I will agree to." He did, in consequence, consult his right hon. friend, and he intimated his approbation of the suggestion&#x2014;a fact which no one had attempted to deny.&#x2014;He here had the consent of the prime minister, and of the Colonial Secretary to the nomination; but further than this he did not take any step on the occasion. He would here say to the right hon. gentleman who spoke last, that if what he was doing, with respect to the appointment of lord Althorp as chairman of the Finance Committee, had, in his mind, even the appearance of giving offence, he would not have touched the matter. He declared, upon his honour, that it was an unintentional slip&#x2014;a proceeding which he did not think would lead to any discord whatever, but that it would, on the contrary, tend to strengthen the government. He had felt it necessary to consult his noble friend, earl Spencer, on the subject, and he had asked him to obtain from his noble friend below him, lord Althorp, an answer to this question; namely, whether if an application were made to him to fill the situation of chairman to the committee, he would accept of the appointment? He had done this because he felt that he should have cut a very foolish figure if, after the nomination was agreed to on the part of the government, the noble lord should have thought proper not to act. Having made this communication to earl Spencer, he received, in answer to it, a letter from lord Althorp, couched in such terms as must prove to the right hon. gentleman opposite, that it was impossible for any man to conceive or to suppose that any conclusive step had been taken. That letter ran thus:&#x2014;"I write to you in consequence of a message which you desired my father to give me. I understand your message was, that you had thoughts of proposing that I should take the chair of the Finance Committee; but before I give a definite answer, I wish to know whether certain arrangements will be agreed to by his majesty's government." This was the answer; and it showed that he had not bargained with, or attempted, in any way, to influence lord
<image src="S2V0018P0I0261"/>
<col>507</col>
Althorp. On the 28th of December, when he made a call, he found the two right hon. gentlemen opposite sitting together. To the best of his recollection the words made use of to him were, "I am glad you are come, for we have been talking over the committee." He was not very accurate in the recollection of words, but he believed his right hon. friend would bear him out in the statement, that it was then said, that the course which had been taken was cordially concurred in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00336"><member>Mr. Huskisson.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I cordially concurred in it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00337"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> denied that he had used the word cordially.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00338"><member>Mr. Tierney</member><membercontribution> said he would leave out the cordiality. He then produced a list of members of that House taken from all sides, and including seventy-five or seventy-six names, from which he told his right hon. friend, he might, if convenient, form the select committee of finance. To show that his feeling with respect to the appointment of the committee was not narrow or contracted, he begged to observe, that there was not the name of a single member of the committee which had been formed, that was not to be found in his list. That conversation occupied but a short time; perhaps half an hour. He then left town for Brighton; and, such was the conviction on his mind that no difference of opinion existed, that if, on the road, he had been questioned by any political friend, he would have said, "Every thing is settled; for I have with me the premier and the chancellor of the Exchequer." It was not till the 1st of December that he received the letter which had been alluded to by his right hon. friend; but that letter did not even mention the name of the chancellor of the Exchequer, much less did it advert to his views or feelings. It came entirely from his right hon. friend, as a suggestion of his own. He there stated, that it would prove inconvenient, if lists of those who were intended to be placed on the committee were shown about; and he expressed a wish that no notice of the list should be taken to lord Althorp himself. He was desirous that the matter should not be noticed until they were nearer the meeting of parliament. That letter gave him no information whatever, as to the sentiments entertained by the right hon. gentleman who spoke last. Although it subsequently appeared to have been written in consequence of information
<col>508</col>
derived from that right hon. gentleman, yet it contained not a syllable with respect to his feelings on this subject. He wrote a letter, in consequence of that to which he had just referred, in which he stated, that he had not shewn the list&#x2014;that he would not show it&#x2014;and that no application for that purpose had been made to him. He further declared, that so far as lord Althorp was concerned, he meant not to say a word; and he sent to his right hon. friend the communication which lord Althorp had previously made to him. That letter was shown to the right hon. gentleman on the 3rd or 4th of January; and how, after receiving that letter, he could imagine that any definite arrangement had been come to, was to him inconceivable. But the right hon. gentleman had spoken out fairly; and, from what he had said, it appeared, that he had, for some time, been acting under a feeling or soreness, in consequence of some differences that had taken place. He, perhaps, was one of those who differed from the right hon. gentleman; but, while in the cabinet, as one of the colleagues of the right hon. gentleman, he never showed any thing but the most cordial and candid feeling towards him. Therefore, in whatever he had done, he could not be supposed to have been actuated by any sinister or personal motives. There appeared to be a good deal of misunderstanding as to the conduct which he (Mr. Tierney) had pursued; but he was ready to meet every thing that could be advanced against him, with reference to any part of his conduct in this business; and he begged leave to assure the right hon. gentleman, on his word of honour, that the only communications which he had had on the subject of the committee were three&#x2014;one on the 19th of November, the meeting which he had with the right hon. gentleman on the 28th of November at his office, and the letter which he had written to his right hon. friend. These were the only three communications he had had on the subject; and they contained nothing which could lead him to believe, that any change was contemplated. It was not until the 9th of January, in the morning, after the government had been dead for four and twenty hours, that he knew any thing of the course which had been adopted. Gentlemen might be surprised, but the fact was, that he never heard one syllable on the subject till the 9th of January; until that time he never knew
<image src="S2V0018P0I0262"/>
<col>509</col>
that any resignation had been sent in; until that time he was wholly ignorant of the matter. He knew not that any intrigue was going on; he knew not that any dissatisfaction existed; he never heard one single word on the subject until the 9th of January. The right hon. gentleman might ask very reasonably, as he (Mr. Tierney), by proposing lord Althorp, was said to have been the means of dissolving the government, why he had taken such a step? He had done so, because he was convinced of his efficiency; and he would tell the right hon. gentleman, that he had to encounter more difficulty in persuading the noble lord to take the office, than the right hon. gentleman could meet with in getting him to resign it. He accepted the office against the grain, not wishing to have such a situation thrust upon him. In justice to all parties, he should like to know how it happened, if there were an objection to the noble lord, that no person ever mentioned it to him? How did it happen that the right hon. gentleman sitting in the cabinet, said nothing about the objection? He never insinuated that he was adverse to their going on with the committee of finance, if the noble lord were at the head of it. On the 29th of December, when coming out of the cabinet room, he asked the right hon. gentleman, "Pray, Mr. Henries, what do you mean to do about the committee of finance?" This was at the last council which he attended while he was in office; another met after the government was dead, on the 9th of January. But what was the answer to his interrogation? "Oh," said the right hon. gentleman, "we must talk about the matter." He (Mr. Tierney) then said, "I have looked into the reports, and I find that the former committee was appointed by ballot." On which the right hon. gentleman observed, "Yes, after a debate." So far from his having any idea at the time, that things had come to such a pass, that gentlemen were about to resign in consequence of his proposition, that he, in pure sincerity of heart, spoke to the right hon. gentleman on the subject of the Finance Committee. The hon. gentleman said, that his whole wish was to make up the difference that existed. If that were so, why did not the right hon. gentleman speak to him on the subject? On other points, he (Mr. Tierney) might be beaten; but on that particular point, the point of reconciliation, he was sure to have been successful. With respect
<col>510</col>
to his opinions, he would refer to his letter of the 21st of December. The right hon. gentleman thought it very hard that he should be considered as entertaining a wish that the government should blow up; yet, from the 21st to the 27th of December, he had not given any notice of his private objection. And then, on the 3rd or 4th of January, there occurred such&#x2014; he knew not what to call it&#x2014;such an earthquake in the government, that, it appeared, he felt it improper to interfere. Now he did not mean to bring a charge against the right hon. gentleman for his conduct in this matter: all he desired was to justify himself. The right hon. gentleman had, on the26th December, mentioned his objection to the colonial secretary; on the 29th he stated to lord Goderich his intention to resign; and, during the whole time, from the 21st to the 30th of December, a correspondence was going on between two members of the government, each threatening to resign, of which he (Mr. Tierney) was entirely ignorant. The right hon. gentleman, if he understood him rightly. said, "Don't believe that I had any hand in overturning the government. The plan for overturning the government was laid before." If this were so, it ought to be made the ground of impeachment against some one; for if he knew that such a plan had existed, and did not disclose its authors, he would be guilty of a dereliction of duty. He was bound, on the part of his majesty's government, to state it. If such a system were tolerated, there was no safety for public men: no man could serve the king under such circumstances; it was impossible.&#x2014;He had seen the speech in the newspapers, which his right hon. friend had delivered elsewhere. In that speech his noble friend lord Goderich and himself were described as most amiable persons; but, in some way or other, it appeared, a cabal, a party, had been formed for blowing up that amiable government. If the speech of his right hon. friend were to be credited, he had come off with flying colours; and yet he (Mr. Tierney) must observe, that appearances were against him to this extent,&#x2014;that his explanation was not sufficiently full. A plain man in the country asked "Why was the government of lord Goderich overturned?" And the answer was, because the chancellor of the Exchequer would not have lord Althorp as chairman of the committee. This was the whole of the answer. Now, he did not
<image src="S2V0018P0I0263"/>
<col>511</col>
mean to Say, that the right hon. gentleman who spoke last cherished any wish to overturn the government; but that right hon. gentleman, he believed, felt some degree of hostility to it on certain matters&#x2014;matters which were wormwood to him. He did not censure the right hon. gentleman's opinions; but it did appear that, for some reason or other, he was out of humour with the government; and indeed he had said, that no man could be in a good humour with a government carried on as that had been. He (Mr. Tierney), viewing what had taken place, would say, that the individual who was at the head of the late government was a very good man, but he thought he was not sufficiently energetic to meet the times, and control the circumstances in which he was placed. On the 19th or 20th of December, a cabinet council was held, at which the restoration of lord Goderich (as it had been called by the right hon. gentleman&#x2014;for gentlemen were always very pleasant when the House was blown up, and they found themselves on their legs) took place. That restoration occurred on the 19th of December, and he certainly understood it was at that council fully canvassed and settled, how far lord Goderich could be re-adopted as minister. He would ask, was the right hon. gentleman there? If so, did he make any objection? Did he make any observation to lord Goderich as to what his own sentiments were? And lastly, was not that the time to have advanced any objection, or to have put forward any observation which his mind might have suggested relative to the ministry? Unquestionably it was; but the right hon. gentleman remained silent; he said not one word on the subject. It looked just as if he had agreed to bolster up the government at night, that he might blow it up the next morning. On the 19th of January he adhered to the government, and on the following day he sent in his resignation. Could that, he demanded, be called fair play?&#x2014;He thought the right hon. gentleman was bound to bring his opinions before the government, in order that he might ascertain what the sentiments of the government were. The right hon. gentleman had said, that he was anxious, at the time, for discussion. Why, then, did he not introduce the subject. The cabinet was the place for discussion. There he might have had discussion to his heart's content: there he might have had information of every description. He
<col>512</col>
believed, that had the right hon. gentleman taken this straightforward course, he would have been in a minority of two; and then he might, without inconsistency, have given up his situation. His right hon. friend, it appeared, had come to the cabinet, on the 19th of December, determined to take no part in the proceedings, and the right hon. gentleman had also come with his resignation in his pocket. Both these gentlemen had kept their pistols half cocked, in order that they might the more readily make use of them. All the circumstances to which he had referred were carefully bottled up; and suddenly the right hon. gentleman, who had previously expressed no dissent to what was going on, declared his determination to resign. He had not the slightest reason to believe that the government was at an end. Indeed, the last determination of his right hon. friend which he had heard of was, that though apprehensive that the government could not go on, he would rather die on the field than abandon the service of his king. Now this was exactly his (Mr. Tierney's) opinion. He thought so too. And, by-the-by, he did not abandon the service, but was killed the other day in "a chance-medley" [A laugh]. Could any body believe that lord Goderich, without any communication with any body, and simply of his own idea,&#x2014;lord Lansdowne, too, being at that very time a member of the cabinet,&#x2014;could any body, he would ask, believe that lord Goderich, without conferring with any of his colleagues, went to the king, and said, that, for such and such reasons, he found it necessary to lay down the government? For his own part, he could not believe it. In charity he could not believe it. The right hon. gentleman who spoke last, had said, that he knew what the reason of this proceeding was. He did not know any thing about it. But he could not believe that lord Goderich could have acted thus without a motive. Who could wonder that upon this the ministry was put an end to? There were the ministers pull-hauling one another about, and the king of course said, as he ought to have said, "Send me some man of talent or influence enough to control these disputants." Such being the state of things, he had fallen back into the ranks in which he had been used to march; and, he must say, with the most implicit obedience to the will of his majesty.&#x2014;He did not know that there were any other mate
<image src="S2V0018P0I0264"/>
<col>513</col>
rial facts upon which he ought to touch. There were several parts of the right hon. gentleman's speech to which he might reply, but with which he would not meddle; though certainly he had never, in the whole course of his life, heard a more inviting speech. But, at the same time, he knew, that if there was the slightest ground for it, any thing that he said might be attributed to soreness at being turned out of office; and he had seen so much of men taking up a violent and intemperate line, on being turned out, that he would give no one an opportunity of fixing this imputation on him. He begged leave to say, that, leaving office without any soreness, he should discharge his duty without any reference to what had passed. He knew that a great many gentlemen had refused to repose confidence in the present government. Now, to the noble duke at the bead of the administration, and to the right hon. gentlemen opposite, he did give his confidence, because it must be given somewhere; and he heartily wished that the noble duke might be enabled to control the jarring and discordant elements, over which he had been called upon to preside. But, let him not hear any thing about Mr. Canning's friends. As to Mr. Canning's friends, he troubled himself no more about them than he did about the passengers in the street. They ought not to care any thing about them; they had not behaved well to them. What could the good people of Liverpool have to do with the reasons why they joined Mr. Canning? What occasion could there be for any man to entertain his constituents with any thing of the kind? The right hon. gentleman who had trumped up several awkward words, had talked about the government being in abeyance. There was no such thing when he joined Mr. Canning. He did not join Mr. Canning during a state of alarm. No; and more than that&#x2014;for a year and a half before he joined Mr. Canning, he had supported that gentleman's measures. Nearly all the support which that gentleman had received, came from the opposition side of the House, when others would have cut the throats of Mr. Canning and his friends at every step they took, if it had not been for the support of that side of the House. He had supported Mr. Canning long before he joined him. He had joined Mr. Canning because he thought that the country had a strong wish to see those two parties.
<col>514</col>
who had for some time been approximating in measures and opinions, join together and form a mixed government. He thought that the same wish still prevailed throughout the country. It was for this reason, then, that he had joined with Mr. Canning; but he had never joined with lord Liverpool. He had never given his support to lord Liverpool's policy. Indeed, he had never been able to find out what the policy of that noble lord was. He knew very well what lord Liverpool's policy was with respect to the Catholic question. It was this:&#x2014;Any man might entertain his own opinion of that measure; any man might support that question in the House; but then he was told he must distinctly state that this was merely his own opinion, and not that of the cabinet; or he might propose it in the cabinet if he chose to take the trouble, knowing, as he must know, what the fate of it would be. This was lord Liverpool's policy with respect to the Catholic question. What his other policy was, however, he did not know, and therefore he did not know what the policy of the present government would be in other affairs. How was it to be with respect to free and liberal opinions? When he heard, as he had heard, that the policy of the Greek treaty was to be persevered in, what did it mean?, Every body knew that the secret article of that treaty authorized the representatives of the contracting powers to meet together, and take into consideration the resorting to ulterior measures, in the event of the Turk refusing to accede to the proposed mediation. Why, then, the door was open, and the way was plain to my lord Dudley.&#x2014;He again said, that he joined Mr. Canning on account of what he believed to be the wishes of the country, and because he could do so without sacrificing any one principle of his own. He had sacrificed no principle: though he certainly exacted nothing of Mr. Canning, yet he told the right hon. gentleman what he thought about a great many things, and what he meant to do on a great many occasions. As to parliamentary reform, for instance, he told Mr. Canning that, though he was too old and too experienced a man to hope to see it carried, yet he desired the right hon. gentleman would distinctly understand, that in taking him in, he took in a man who would always vote for a parliamentary reform. Mr. Canning readily agreed with him that he should do
<image src="S2V0018P0I0265"/>
<col>515</col>
so, and, knowing probably, as well as he did, how little chance the question had of being carried, merely added, with a smile, that he hoped he would not fight for parliamentary reform, on the Treasury bench, and he (Mr. T.) promised that he would not; but that he would go up a bench or two higher whenever he had occasion to speak upon it [a laugh.] The repeal of the Test and Corporation acts he told Mr. Canning he was pledged to support, and that he should support it at all times. This was all he had said to Mr. Canning. &#x2014;Now as to the policy of Mr. Canning with regard to Ireland. What had been the policy of the late government, and of that which had preceded it? It had been the policy of both the cabinets antecedent to Mr. Canning's to prevent the Catholic Question by all fair means from being carried. He did not mention it as casting any fault upon the right hon. gentlemen who had belonged to those cabinets; he merely meant to state the fact, that the policy of those cabinets was to watch that question narrowly, and if possible to keep it down. Now, Mr. Canning's policy was directly opposite. It was his policy to watch for, and to seize, the first opportunity of passing it. And yet he was to be told that the policy of Mr. Canning and of the other two cabinets, were the same. Had not Mr. Canning also introduced a measure for the purpose of enabling Catholic peers to vote in the House of Lords? And yet Mr. Canning's policy was the same with that of the cabinets that had preceded his. Now he would say that Mr. Canning's policy was one thing, and the policy of the other cabinets another and a different thing. He was quite sure that he entertained every respect for the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Peel) opposite, but then to say that the Catholics were to have the same confidence in him, their open and avowed opponent, as they were to have in lord Lansdowne, their open and avowed friend, was absurd. He did rejoice at another right hon. friend of his (Mr. Lamb) going back to Ireland; and the right hon. gentleman, he believed, would do all the good to that country he could. He was glad to hear that the noble marquis (Anglesea) had gone to that country, and he rejoiced to see the Irish with a chancellor who was one of the best and soundest of lawyers, and who was not addicted to meddle with politics. What, however, was to happen
<col>516</col>
now, he did not know. What change was; to take place he did not know. But this was his point;&#x2014;namely, that the policy of lord Liverpool was one in which the friends of Mr. Canning ought not to agree. That policy was to get rid of Mr. Canning when they were strong, and to take him in when they were weak. There had, too, been a policy to sully the fame of that statesman by every expression of vituperation that imagination could suggest; and now his friends, not relinquishing that policy, came forward and said "this is the way in which we sanctify his memory." Having said thus much upon dates and facts, so far as they had come to his knowledge, he should now sit down with repeating, that, for his part, he had never taken part in any proceeding which was intended as a slight upon the right hon. gentleman who spoke last.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00339"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution>, in explanation, said, he thought it right in reply to that part of the right hon. gentleman's observation, which related to a conversation on the 29th of December, in the cabinet room, to state, that he then supposed the right hon. gentleman to be acquainted with what had passed; and that his address to him had appeared as extraordinary to him, as his had to the right hon. gentleman. He added, that in using the words "I know," with reference to the intention of making the difference between him and the right hon. Secretary for the colonies the means of dissolving the government, he meant to say, that he drew the positive conclusion from the circumstance that it must be so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00340"><member>Colonel Wood</member><membercontribution> said, that, with all the reluctance which he felt at intruding himself upon the notice of the House, he felt it his duty to say one word upon this question. The noble lord in the course of his opening speech that night, having unnecessarily and invidiously contrasted the foreign policy of Mr. Canning with that of his noble predecessor, he hoped the House would excuse him if he set him right upon that subject. It did not seem to him to be necessary to Mr. Canning's reputation to contrast his policy with that of his predecessor, and in the way in which the subject had been introduced, injustice was done to both. The noble lord had said, that he had heard with surprise that Mr. Canning found the line of foreign' policy already marked out, in a note accidentally discovered in some portfolio, and which never would have come to light;
<image src="S2V0018P0I0266"/>
<col>517</col>
had it not been for Mr. Canning's appointment to the foreign office. Now, he had heard Mr. Canning declare, that the foreign policy, especially with respect to the new States of South America was founded oil a note, found in the portfolio in the foreign office, as it had been decided upon by his predecessor. He was sure that if Mr. Pitt and Mr. Canning were to revisit the earth, they would approve of the government of the duke of Wellington, knowing as they must, that that government would promote, in the highest degree, the happiness and prosperity of the country. He himself had the most entire confidence in the duke of Wellington's administration; as he felt that no man had a greater interest in preserving the peace, and watching over the welfare, of the country, than the man who, by his prowess, had so greatly contributed to establish both. The House, he thought, would be more usefully employed in contemplating the future, than in raking up discussions upon the past.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00341"><member>Mr. Stanley</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;After the explanations already given by the three right hon. gentlemen who have addressed the House &#x2014;competent as they, from their immediate connection with the events to which these explanations referred, were &#x2014; the House would doubtless regard it as unseasonable, if not impertinent, if I were to make any comments upon the dissolution of the late cabinet. If, on the breaking up of that government, there were any plots, intrigues, machinations, or counter-machinations&#x2014; if by any combination of circumstances results were developed unexpected and inconsecutive&#x2014;if, upon any occasion, dissensions of two right hon. gentlemen who now sit together in the same cabinet were or were not made a means of excluding certain right hon. and noble friends of mine from office&#x2014;if, in fine, any thing had happened in these transactions beyond the plain and straight-forward course which is already known to the public, and the world at large, my subordinate situation in the government exempts me from any knowledge or responsibility for them. My duty, therefore, upon this occasion, lies within a small compass, and I think I shall have complied with all that the House can expect of me when I state&#x2014;and that I shall do as concisely as I possibly can&#x2014;the reasons why, with reference to the change of principles of the government, I have been compelled&#x2014;reluctantly I acknowledge&#x2014;
<col>518</col>
to decline acting further under the directions of the right hon. gentleman who fills the situation of Colonial Secretary for this country. Before, however, I proceed to that, there is one circumstance, of a personal nature, to which I wish to advert, and that because the circumstance does not relate to myself. I could have wished that, during what I am going to say, the right hon. Secretary to the Colonies had been present; but in his absence I shall communicate to the House what I have been requested to state respecting him. The noble marquis, whom I am proud to call my friend, the late Secretary for the Home Department, understanding that some notice had been taken of a speech of his the other night in the House of Lords, and a construction put upon that speech, as if it raised an implication that, in the communication which he had with the right hon. gentleman on the 11th, he had not met with that entire confidence which he expected&#x2014;that noble marquis has authorised me to state openly, and once for all, that what he meant to say was this, that when he met the right hon. Secretary upon the 11th, it was under feelings of the most entire confidence&#x2014;that he had no reason to doubt but that the confidence was mutual&#x2014;and that as the conversation in question had been alluded to out of doors as if it was unsanctioned, and that Mr. Huskisson had made an improper use of a confidential conversation, the noble marquis has desired me to say, that there was not the least colour for such a charge; that he disclaimed it altogether; and that, with respect to what passed between him and Mr. Huskisson, the noble marquis had no charge whatever to make against the right hon. Secretary.&#x2014;Having said thus much upon the subject, I now proceed to say a few words upon the motive why I did not continue in the situation which I had the honour to hold, and why I cannot give the I present government that steady and pledged support, which all governments have a right to expect from their subordinate members. I know it is the creed of many men who fill public employments, that I they ought to regulate their conduct by that of some other individual, whose acceptance of place under a government is with them a sufficient warrant, for their support, and whose exclusion would justify their dissent from, and opposition to, its' measures. I envy those gentlemen the simplicity and accommodating nature of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0267"/>
<col>519</col>
their reasoning, by which they contrive to divest themselves of all trouble of thinking for themselves, but I cannot say that I have the boldness to imitate their example. God forbid that I should be wanting in deference and respect for the opinions of those who are my superiors in age, ability, and political experience. There are men, for whose principles I have an unfeigned admiration, whose conduct I should be proud to imitate; and whose manly, straight-forward, honourable, and consistent course, upon the present occasion, must command my respect and praise. But, that species of political slavery which acknowledges the influence, not of conviction, but of example&#x2014;which requires a blind acquiescence, and exacts an unqualified adherence and submission&#x2014;I cannot promise to any one. My decision, as to the course which I ought to pursue with respect to the present cabinet, has been founded upon a deliberate and cool calculation of its members, and of the measures which are likely to emanate from them. I have come to that decision with the greatest reluctance; for I fairly own, that I anticipated much satisfaction and advantage from the situation in which I was placed&#x2014;satisfaction and advantage, because I should find myself placed in immediate connection with the great and statesmanlike views of the right hon. gentleman who is Colonial Secretary, and whom I shall still call my friend, although we no longer co-operate together in office. I say that, in the colonial department, I could feel no greater pleasure than in executing his orders; because I firmly believe that he acted honestly, and in accordance with excellent principles; to no one of which, as far as I was capable of understanding them, I did not give my cordial and unqualified consent. But, whilst I thus pay this homage to the talents of that right hon. gentleman, it is but justice to myself to say, that it is with surprise and regret that I look at the choice of associates which he has made, to act with, or rather under, at this moment. I cannot but consider, that whatever may be said of the want of union in the late administration&#x2014;and circumstances have been stated to show that there was a want of union&#x2014; no man living who looks at the present cabinet can say, that they are a united or consistent government. Every one must see the strange medley of men and principles of which it is composed&#x2014;such, in
<col>520</col>
deed, as has seldom been seen under any government. I know it will be told, and it is easy to say, that "we have voted together, acted together, and given votes on the same question&#x2014;we are all harmony and peace, and nothing can be better united or more consistent than we are." All this is easy to say, but I want this test before I am satisfied,&#x2014;experience to prove it. I want some understanding, that the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies will be able to carry into effect all those principles to which he is fairly and honestly attached. But what security do the present ministry hold out for the probable accomplishment of such an object? As to the harmony of the present government, &#x2014;as to its union,&#x2014;as to the community of principles among its members,&#x2014;I must see evidence of the whole before I can believe. For my part, it appears to me to be just the reverse in its constitution. It seems to me to be one of those heterogeneous junctions which Horace so well describes the capricious goddess as taking pleasure in&#x2014;
<quote>&#x2014;"Cut placet impares
Formas atque animos sub juga ahenea
S&#x00E6;vo mittere cum joco."</quote>
So ludicrously painful is the contrast of these gentlemen, that they make a joke of each other's principles. Having this opinion of the members of the government, I felt that I could not give them that pledged support, which, under other circumstances, I would willingly do; and it only remains for me to say what impression the undertaking which was said to be given, as to their conduct upon particular points, has made on my mind. If I could understand the exact terms which had been used;&#x2014; if any ever had been used&#x2014;in which that undertaking was given, I would give an opinion upon the question. But until I do understand those terms, I must suspend my judgment. There has been so much special pleading about the actual receiving or giving of the words, that it is difficult to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion. The words "guarantee," "agreement," "understanding," "stipulation," and "pledge," have been used, and have been all disclaimed. The right hon. gentleman is angry at having it said, that he made any stipulation whatever, and yet, in the next breath, he tells us that he told the duke of Wellington it was a necessary condition of his accepting office, that his three friends should come
<image src="S2V0018P0I0268"/>
<col>521</col>
in with him. And this we are told is not a stipulation. I agree with the right hon. gentleman, that it is not a satisfactory stipulation; because we have no security for the extent to which he means to execute it. But, are we to be told that, having had one concession made to him by the admission of a new party to the cabinet, it was out of his power to obtain terms upon other points of great public importance? Much has been said, but I have yet to hear the answer to the question, "Whether or not will the policy of Mr. Canning be acted upon; or is the right hon. gentleman determined to adhere to that only, with or without a guarantee?" If the answer is in the affirmative, all I can say is, that the government shall have my support. I wish they would give me the opportunity of bringing to their side my humbled; but, to say the truth, I Bee no great reason to hope that they mean to do any thing to deserve it. I could have gladly supported the right hon. Secretary in his well-meant reforms, and useful measures, for the colonial department. But, can I forget that the very nobleman whose system it is intended to reform, is himself in the cabinet? I could support the right hon. gentleman's views of a free trade, but I know those views have their opponents in the cabinet &#x2014;his foreign Corn-bill; but that the very duke of Wellington, who marred the measure last year, is now at the head of the government. And, seeing the cabinet thus arranged, is my <i>&#x00E0;, priori</i> impression weakened by what I have lately heard from one of the right hon. gentleman's colleagues in the cabinet (lord Ellenborough), who recently denounced Mr. Canning as a dangerous innovator? The present cabinet differs from the policy of Mr. Canning, or it does not. Is it forgotten, that the leading members of lord Liverpool's government all went out of office to a man, rather than serve under that right hon. gentleman as premier? Did this proceed from principle, or from the ebullition of personal pique? That I shall leave to others to determine. One thing was certain, that there was a discordance in their policy, wide enough to warrant the separation. The seceders knew that Mr. Canning was inclined and committed to a certain line of liberal policy&#x2014;they withdrew from him at a time when he was about to carry those principles into operation. That very circumstance, and that
<col>522</col>
alone, was enough to justify me and my friends in giving all support to Mr. Canning's principles, which, forsooth, we are gravely assured, are the principles of the men now in office, who were the men who did their utmost to resist and defeat him. There is one question on which it is impossible not to see that a signal alteration has been made by the constitution of the present government; I need not say that I allude to that momentous subject of Ireland and the Catholic claims. The people of that unhappy country looked to the late administration, if not with confidence, at least with good will; but, by the present cabinet, their hopes of success must be thrown back for a considerable period, although they never can be utterly extinguished. We are told&#x2014;but it really is too flimsy for an argument&#x2014;that it was impossible for the late ministry to have carried the Catholic question; but the people of Ireland well knew that, among the members of the late government, they had a strong body of friends, ready to take every favourable opportunity of promoting their cause; that they were determined to push it forward, whoever might be its friends or foes&#x2014;not injudiciously or mischievously: but to make it their first and leading object, for the attainment of which they were ready to sacrifice themselves, if necessary. It is now asserted, that there is a majority in the cabinet in favour of concession. Such a statement is absurd. Do we not know perfectly well, that on the one side there is coolness, lukewarmness, and indifference, not to say insincerity&#x2014;while, on the other side, there is zeal, sincerity, and honest determination, not to say bigotry? I except, of course, my right hon. friend (Mr. Huskisson). I am not throwing out any imputation of indifference or lukewarmness against him. Against the Catholics, I see ranged all the leading members of the cabinet&#x2014;the prime minister and the leader of the House of Commons&#x2014;one of those who abandoned his office because, when Mr. Canning came into power, too much influence would attach to the appointment of first lord of the Treasury in favour of the Catholic question. This was the ground assigned by the present Home Secretary, for refusing to join Mr. Canning; and he cannot now mean to contend that the Catholic question, under the change, remains unchanged. I, therefore, look to the present administration without confidence, but not
<image src="S2V0018P0I0269"/>
<col>523</col>
without hope; for I have hope, in the first place, in the memory of that great statesman, whose eloquence, only eight months ago, resounded within these walls, and re-echoed to the remotest corner of the empire. That eloquence is now mute; and I cannot recall the past without the most painful recollections of all his powers and excellencies. But, although he is lost to the country, I cannot believe, in spite of what I now witness, that his principles have not survived. I cannot but believe that he occasioned such a change in the feelings and opinions of the country, that it never can return to the state from which he raised it. I am convinced that the old and stubborn spirit of Toryism is at last yielding to the increased liberality of the age&#x2014;that Tories of the old school&#x2014;the Sticklers for inveterate abuses under the name of the wisdom of our ancestors, the <i>"laudatores temporis acti,"</i> are giving way on all sides&#x2014;that the spirit which supported the Holy Alliance, the friend of despotism rather than the advocate of Struggling freedom, is hastening to the fate it merits, and that all its attendant evils are daily becoming matters which belong to history alone. I have hopes that the gentlemen who, no more than a year ago, displayed so much ancient and exploded Toryism on their temporary exclusion with the recovery of their offices have recovered their good humour&#x2014;that calm retirement and a summer's sojourn in the country have brought them to their senses, and have shewn them how blind they were to the real interests of the country. If they have arrived at this conviction, I hope to see them second the liberal spirit of the age, and, by supporting the policy of Mr. Canning, deserve the Confidence of parliament and the country. If this be the happy result, at least we may say that the late administration has not lived in vain; and proud would be the honourable and noble persons who have just relinquished place to have bartered the possession of it for the maintenance and enforcement of those principles, and that system of policy, which they are satisfied will promote the best interests of the empire. I ought to apologise for troubling the House so long, and, perhaps, for attaching to myself an undue importance; but I thought it right to state frankly my feelings upon the present occasion. I shall be happy at all times to support the measures of government, if I
<col>524</col>
can do so consistently; and it will give me much greater pleasure to give them my honest and conscientious assistance, than to find myself compelled to give their measures a reluctant but determined opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00342"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, he did not rise to obtrude his opinions, but he had been accidentally placed in a situation of responsibility, from which he would not shrink. The noble lord at the head of the late administration had sent for him that morning, requesting some conversation on the subject about to be discussed in the House of Commons this evening. Lord Goderich had subsequently written a letter to him, which, for his own justification, he would take the liberty of reading:&#x2014;
<quote>"February 18,1828.</quote>
<quote>"In reference to the conversation I had with you this morning, on the subject of what may pass in the House of Commons to-night, I venture to rely on your kind and friendly feelings towards me, in case any thing should be said which may seem to require explanation on my part, and which, in consequence of my communication with you, you may have it in your power to explain. I certainly have no desire that any unnecessary explanation should be given, and should be particularly sorry to impose such a task upon you, or in any degree to fetter your opinion on the general question; but you may be enabled to render me an essential service, and I trust you may do it, if necessary, without compromising yourself or any one else."</quote>
He had understood the present master of the Mint to state, that, in his opinion, the noble lord lately at the head of the government had availed himself of the circumstances of his resignation, for the purpose of putting an end to a cabinet which, for other reasons, it was desirous to terminate. If he were mistaken, he hoped the right hon. gentleman would correct him before he proceeded further. That right hon. gentleman had read a letter of his own, dated the 7th of January (in answer to a communication from the noble lord), explaining the principles on which he tendered his resignation, being desirous not to prejudice the government beyond what, under the circumstances, could not be avoided. When a letter was read, it was absolutely necessary, for the due understanding of it, that that to which it was a reply should also be read. He (Mr. W.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0270"/>
<col>525</col>
Horton) had understood lord Goderich to state, that, from the period of the explanation being given by the Secretary for the Colonies (Mr. Huskisson) to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Herries), namely, between the 9th and the 21st of December, he had no reason to suppose that any dissatisfaction remained in the mind of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Berries). The House would distinctly recollect, that Mr. Herries said, in allusion to that fact, that he had not pressed his objections until a subsequent period, as he did not think it a matter of sufficient importance at that period. The noble lord distinctly stated to him (Mr. W. Horton), that he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that the right hon. gentleman entertained any permanent dissatisfaction, until he received on the 21st of December, the letter of the right hon. gentleman, in which he detailed the reasons which induced him to give in his resignation, on the ground of the appointment of the chairman of the Committee of Supply. With this introduction, he would proceed to read the letter of the noble lord:&#x2014;
<quote>"January 4, 1828.</quote>
<quote>"My dear Herries&#x2014;The more I reflect upon this unfortunate question respecting the finance committee, the more I am convinced that the view which you have taken up is founded on a misconception, both of the circumstances which took place at the end of November, and of the consequences that would result from placing lord Althorp in the chair of that committee. I am quite convinced that there was no intention whatever of treating you with disrespect, or of exposing you to the embarrassment of not being in your proper place, in all that relates to a matter so closely connected with your department. It is certainly unfortunate, then, that any thing whatever was said to lord Althorp, before it was settled that something should be said; but it by no means follows from that circumstance, that the government ought to be placed in jeopardy, if it can be avoided, especially at a moment so peculiarly inconvenient to the king's service, and to the public interest, as the present must necessarily be. Now, as to the appointment itself, I must say, that it appears to me that you greatly over-rate the objections and difficulties." [He would not read the noble lord's argument, as he did not think it necessary to the purpose for which he produced this letter]&#x2014;" I
<col>526</col>
wish very much you would well consider the matter before you decide to withdraw from the government, under circumstances which would cause so much embarrassment." [The embarrassment to which the noble lord here alluded was the probable resignation of other members of the government in consequnce of that of Mr. Herries]&#x2014;" If I thought I was counselling anything discreditable to you personally, nothing would induce me to lay this view of the case before you; but we all owe much to the king and to the public good; and, although I feel every day more and more the extent of the sacrifice which office requires, and the pressure, bodily and mental, which it imposes, I feel that we ought, if possible, to meet parliament, to justify our measures, and then leave it to parliament to take what course they may choose in deciding upon our fate."</quote>
Having discharged this duty to his noble friend, he now wished to say a few words as to the situation in which the government found itself. The hon. gentleman who spoke last had stated his reasons for doubting whether certain pledges would be redeemed, and whether the principles of policy in the colonial department would not be changed. On this point he would only say, in justification of himself, and of the noble lord formerly at the head of that department, that no such change of policy would be found to take place. He was prepared to assert, before the finance committee should prove the fact, that all the elements of improvement in the colonial system were in progress. That progress was necessarily slow, but the foundation had been laid, and little more remained but to complete the work, by carrying the plans into execution. This was the deliberate conviction of his mind, and not a mere matter of assertion. The great change was in a course of being accomplished; contrasting the policy which is to be with the policy which was. The hon. gentleman had also stated his reasons, why he withdrew, not his confidence so much as his support from the present ministry. He also might be allowed to explain shortly on what grounds, as at present advised, he should give his determined support to the existing cabinet. He must say for his own part&#x2014;he did not know whether the majority of the House would concur with him;&#x2014;but it was his decided opinion, that if his right hon. friend the Secretary for the Colonies, be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0271"/>
<col>527</col>
lieved, and had reason to believe, that the course-of policy to be pursued by the government was fairly, openly, and honourably, to act on the principles of Mr. Canning; if he thought that those principles would be carried into effect by the present government; if he hoped that those measures of improvement would be followed up&#x2014;for when he spoke of Mr. Canning's principles, he would say, that his system was a combination of improvements, which might have been prosecuted by other statesmen, but which by him, and by him alone, were concentrated into one focus&#x2014; and it was not to be apprehended, that any material retrogradation would arise when those principles were firmly fixed&#x2014;if his right hon. friend had felt the conviction, that he could assist in carrying those principles into execution, and if he had shrunk through cowardice from joining those with whom he had formerly acted, he would have stood immeasurably lower in the estimation of the country than he now did [a laugh]. These were his honest and candid opinions. It might be well for gentlemen to treat them with mirth, but he avowed them as his sincere sentiments. The House and the country had been sufciently drugged with personalities. It was high time to look to measures, and not to engage in discussions of personal disputes. They should wait to see whether the principles which were professed would be carried into execution. That would be an object more worthy the attention of the House than any individual dissentions. He earnestly trusted that that night was the last on which the attention of the House would be bestowed to the gratification of mere curiosity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00343"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> said, that as his name had been so repeatedly brought forward in the present discussion, he should feel himself guilty of disrespect to the House, if he did not state shortly the very little part which he had personally had in the transaction principally in question. But before he entered into that explanation he begged to assure the right hon. the master of the Mint, that he had never, for one moment, conceived that that right hon. gentleman was influenced by any personal grounds in objecting to his nomination as chairman of the finance committee. He was quite satisfied that the right hon. gentleman had not acted from any impulse of which he had a right to complain. The right hon. gentleman and his right hon. friend had stated
<col>528</col>
fully and correctly, what had passed on the subject of the proposed arrangement. His right hon. friend, as had been stated, had sent a message to him, through lord Spencer, the purport of which, as he understood, was to ascertain whether if he were proposed as chairman of the finance committee, he would accept of the office. His answer was, that he wished first to have some time to consider of the proposition; and he did afterwards write to his right hon. friend in the words which had been stated. He told his right hon. friend, that he was willing to accept the appointment; but, on the clear understanding, that in doing so he should be at liberty in the committee either to oppose or to support the measures of government as his judgment should direct. He felt the laborious nature of the duty which he was about to undertake, and the great responsibility which its functions involved, and accepted it much against his will; but he thought, at the same time, that as a member of that House, he could not justifiably refuse the office. His right hon. friend had stated, and stated most truly, that if any subsequent difficulty should arise on the point&#x2014;if the slightest objection to his appointment should be felt in any quarter &#x2014;if either his right hon. friend, or any of those with whom he acted, should change their opinions, and conceive it more expedient to appoint any other person, he, so far from taking offence, would, as he stated in his letter to his right hon. friend, feel himself relieved from a laborious duty, and one which he was not about to undertake with any feeling of eagerness or satisfaction. After this communication of his, nothing passed on the subject until about the middle of December, when he felt a curiosity to know how the business was going on, and he called on his right hon. friend to ask him the question, on the 14th of December. His right hon. friend informed him that the matter was still quite open, that nothing further had passed, but that he meant to propose his appointment in the cabinet. And this was all that he knew upon the subject. The objections to his appointment had been alluded to by the master of the Mint. It seemed there were two objections. The right hon. gentleman objected to him as being closely connected with party. He was perfectly ready to admit that, for the greater portion of his life, he had been a decided party man: he avowed it: he was not
<image src="S2V0018P0I0272"/>
<col>529</col>
ashamed of it; because acting with a party-was generally the best method of attaining any public benefit: but, what had occurred last spring had entirely separated him from party: he now knew of no party to which he belonged; and it was surely an unfortunate time for the right hon. gentleman to object to him as a party man, at the very moment when he had ceased to be so. He repeated, that he was not now a party man, and he had no immediate prospect of being so again. Another objection of the right hon. gentleman to him was, that he had preconceived opinions on the subject of finance. He acknowledged that he had such opinions; but he believed that his hon. friend, just placed in the chair of that committee (sir H. Parnell) had even more strongly preconceived opinions than himself. At the same time he was well aware that that hon. friend had attended to the subject, and understood it a great deal better than he could pretend to do. The right hon. the master of the Mint, however, wished to have a man at the head of the finance committee, who had, what he called no fixed opinions: and if that was the only thing which could satisfy him, the best course, in his opinion, would have been, to select a chairman from among those who had never thought at all upon the subject. It was rather unfortunate, however, for the right hon. gentleman's ground of objection, that the secretary for the colonies had that night stated, that he had told lord Goderich, when the matter was discussed, that his principal objection was not, that lord Althorp had fixed opinions, but that he did not think he had attended sufficiently to those questions which must be agitated in a finance committee. The master of the Mint had, on the contrary, maintained, that his opinions were much too firmly fixed, on every thing connected with these subjects. Certainly, he had fixed opinions; he was willing to admit that he had them, and to declare them. He had a decided opinion, that the keeping up a sinking fund, for the mere sake of saying that they had a sinking fund, was a highly disadvantageous mode of disposing of the resources of the country. He did not say, however, that he was not open to conviction upon that subject. All he wished to be understood to say, was, that he should hold that opinion, until he found such good reasons offered in the committee, or any where else, as might induce him to change it He
<col>530</col>
had thought it necessary to trouble the House with this explanation, and he would not now trespass further on their attention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00344"><member>Sir G. Warrender</member><membercontribution> said, he could not feel himself at liberty to place any confidence in a government, which contained among its leading members, men so strongly pledged to oppose Catholic emancipation, as his right hon. friend the Secretary for the Home Department. He recollected very well that the right hon. gentleman stated, that his principal ground for refusing to remain in office under the late Mr. Canning, was his advocacy of that question, as the head of the government; and he recollected equally well, that the right hon. gentleman declared, that if that question was acceded to by any government of which he was a member, he should feel bound to retire instantly from office. If, then, the right hon. gentleman held those opinions, must it not be supposed that they were, in some measure, the tenure of office, and that the opinions of the head of the government would influence all the members of that government? He had held office for sixteen years under lord Liverpool, and yet there was no opinion entertained of the Catholic question, by the members of that cabinet, which could lead to such an effect upon those connected with the government. Was it not plain, however, that the declared opinions of the head of a government, that he held his office by-hostility to the Catholic claims, must affect the subordinate members of that government; and that all its supporters would either have the zeal of their opposition strengthened, or their warmth in the cause of emancipation weakened, by the declaration that resistance to the claims of the Catholics was one of the principles of the government? Upon these grounds, and from no disrespect to his right hon. friend, whose talents and abilities he knew and appreciated, he could not support the government, and must look at all its movements with a distrustful eye. With regard to the question which had been agitated that night, he certainly must say, that, admiring as he did the genius and talent, and cherishing the memory, of Mr. Canning, he did look upon the construction of the new government with very mixed feelings. Some of those feelings arose from the opposition&#x2014; the personal opposition&#x2014;which had been offered to that great man's government last year; and the others originated in the suspicion, that there might have been some of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0273"/>
<col>531</col>
his principles sacrificed in the junction which had taken place. He, however, found that there was a guarantee for the support of the principles of Mr. Canning; and he found that guarantee&#x2014;mot as the right hon. Secretary had stated, from the persons who remained in the government, but from those he found to be left out. If he recollected right, there was one learned lord (Eldon), than whom no member of the cabinet was at all times so constantly opposed to every part of the policy, both foreign and domestic, of the late Mr. Canning; and when he found that learned lord had neither been consulted nor thought of, in the late arrangements, he thought he saw a plain proof above all others, that the policy of Mr. Canning was to be persevered in. When the right hon. Secretary had no longer an adversary so powerful as that learned lord to contend against, there was reason to hope, that he would be allowed to persevere in that system of policy, in which he had taken such an active part, and of which he might be considered as the distinguished supporter. Upon these grounds, he saw reason to think that the policy of the last government would be maintained; but he, at the same time, felt bound to say, with pain, that the declarations of the right hon. Secretary for the Home Department, with respect to the Catholic question&#x2014;a question he had supported, to his utmost power, during his life&#x2014;prevented him from reposing that confidence in its professions, which he might otherwise have entertained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00345"><member>Lord Milton</member><membercontribution> said, that if he could agree with the hon. member opposite, respecting the conversation which had taken place that night&#x2014;if he could see nothing in the present debate but the gratification of an idle curiosity, he would admit that the House had spent a great many hours to very little purpose. But, when he considered the disclosures which had been made; and when he reflected that it was of the last importance, that the characters of men employed in high official situations should be rightly and thoroughly understood, he could not regret the time that had been bestowed on the inquiry. With respect to what had been stated by the right hon. the master of the Mint, he was free to confess, that that right hon. gentleman, in many parts of his speech, had made out a good case for himself. But, at the same time, the right hon. gentleman must give him leave to express his fears,
<col>532</col>
lest there might be some persons in the country who, from some parts of his statement, might suspect that more of private than of public feeling formed the groundwork of his actions, on the occasion in question; because he had, more than once, in the course of his speech, referred to certain objections to his entrance into the cabinet; and those objections might be construed into a ground of jealousy on the subject of the nomination of his noble friend as chairman of the committee of finance. He lamented that the statement of the right hon. gentleman should have furnished any handle for such a supposition as this; because it was most unfortunate when the people had any reason to believe, that the conduct of men acting in a public capacity was influenced by feelings of a private nature. With respect to the right hon. the Secretary for the Colonies, he must confess that his forming part of the present administration was the only ground upon which he built a hope of a good administration of the public affairs. He confessed, however, at the same time, that he should have been much better pleased, if he could have understood that the right hon. gentleman had obtained some more substantial guarantees, for the carrying into effect the measures to which he was pledged, than those to which he had alluded. The question was, how that right hon. gentleman happened to be in office? and the answer which he gave, and always repeated, to that question was, "I and certain others are in office; and that circumstance is a sufficient guarantee that our measures will be carried into execution." That, indeed, would be perfectly well, if the government of this country were divided into separate departments&#x2014;if there were one government for the colonies, another for the financial department, a third for the army, and others for the various other great branches of the public service. But this was not the case. There was but one government; and if men wished to understand its principles, they must look to the individual who was placed at its head. If he wanted an authority on this point, he could appeal to the language of the right hon. the Home Secretary in the last session, who distinctly, and he thought triumphantly, stated, that he could no longer continue a member of the government, because the individual at its head was pledged to measures, or at least had avowed opinions, utterly dissonant
<image src="S2V0018P0I0274"/>
<col>533</col>
from his own. It appeared from this, that he (lard Milton) could have no stronger argument for withdrawing the little share of support which he had felt it his duty last session to furnish to the government, than the conduct of that right hon. gentleman himself. It was somewhat extraordinary that the right hon. the Secretary for the Colonies seemed to take credit to himself for not having entered into any stipulations. Now, he hoped he was mistaken in his notions on this head. He hoped it would turn out, that the right hon. gentleman had sufficient influence in the cabinet to procure his measures to be carried into effect; but when he recollected what had occurred last session, and considered to whom was attributable the defeat of that great measure, for the accomplishment of which the country looked to the right hon. gentleman, and when he saw the very individual who was the author of that defeat at the head of the government, he confessed he could not look forward with any sanguine expectations to the completion of that most important measure &#x2014; a measure, the discussion of which it would be impossible for the right hon. gentleman to elude. He knew, indeed, that it was intended to bring the question forward, and, as was said, on the same principles as before; and he trusted he was too fearful in his anticipations. But if the measure should be carried through that House, and he defeated in the House of Lords, what would the country think? Would it not be thought that the right hon. gentleman had obtained but a poor guarantee for the accomplishment of his measures? He did not mean to say that the right hon. gentleman could have obtained sufficient guarantees. He did not know that the noble duke at the head of the administration was capable of giving them. He could not, of course, be answerable for the conduct of the House of Lords, but he could be answerable for his own conduct in the House of Lords, and for the influence of the government not being Unduly exercised. He was apprehensive the country would think that the right hon. gentleman had obtained but a slight guarantee, if he had only procured seats in the cabinet for himself and two or three others. It would be thought to be rather a barter for seats, than a means of carrying into effect the principles which were professed and proclaimed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00346"><member>Lord Morpeth</member><membercontribution> said, he had no wish to
<col>534</col>
enter upon the discussion of the subjects which had been opened by the right hon. the Secretary for the Colonies, and the right hon. the Master of the Mint. The merits of their case were now before this House and the country; and it would be for the House and the country to form their deliberate judgment on the respective value of the statements severally made by the two right hon. gentlemen, the "Arcades" of the present cabinet. But there was one part of the speech of the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies, upon which he could not help offering a few words. More he was sensible it would be superfluous to urge, but less it would be a dereliction of duty to utter. Having long looked to that right hon. gentleman as the representative of Mr. Canning's policy, and believing that policy to be intimately connected with the best interests of the country, he had seen the right hon. Secretary rise that evening with anxious hope; he had listened to his statements with deep attention; and, he was sorry to add, that he had heard him conclude with profound disappointment. It was, however, but justice to premise that, in respect of the statements lately made by him at Liverpool, that right hon. gentleman had made out his case most satisfactorily. What he complained of was this&#x2014;when the right hon. gentleman, in common with those of his colleagues, who were supposed to participate in his views, separated himself from those members of the late government who had joined his departed friend in his hour of utmost need&#x2014;acting, it must be believed, from the sincere conviction they entertained of the value of those principles which he advocated&#x2014; when the right hon. gentleman allied himself to those who, it was now matter of notoriety (unless indeed the country had been most grossly deceived), had long differed from Mr. Canning on subjects of the most vital concernment&#x2014;to those who, but in the preceding year, had manifested the strongest disposition to thwart the measures, and embitter the repose of the deceased minister&#x2014;when the right hon. gentleman united himself with men who declined to follow his remains to the grave, he thought, and doubtless so did a majority of the country, that the right hon. gentleman would rest his justification upon demonstrating, that he had still maintained his principles, and that his sense of what was due to the public service had led him
<image src="S2V0018P0I0275"/>
<col>535</col>
to sacrifice the natural feelings of a man, or rather of a friend, to the sterner duties of a patriot. With no small degree of surprise, therefore, and with yet greater pain, had he collected from the right hon. gentleman's speech of that evening, that the only security or guarantee for the perseverance of the present government in that policy, and those measures, was an impression, which the right hon. gentleman had been pleased to adopt in his own mind, that there was really so perfect a concurrence of opinion between him and his new colleagues in office, as would have made any more actual or matter-of-fact bargain or understanding between them, not only unnecessary, but degrading. Leaving the utter insufficiency of this statement to the remarks which had already been made upon it by his hon. friend (Mr. Stanley), in respect to the Catholic question, he would only observe, that he could make no secret of his own opinion, that it was of the last importance to the repose of the world at large, that Mr. Canning's system should be persevered in. The foreign relations of this country ever since they had passed under the control of that lamented statesman, had been governed by a policy, of which, consummate as he believed its wisdom to have been, and admirable as he considered its effects, he knew nothing more wise, more excellent, or more honourable&#x2014;no, not even the well-timed recognition of the South American republics, not even the well-planned expedition to Portugal, than the sagacity displayed in the treaty of the 6th of July of last year, and the whole course of policy by which it had been succeeded. However that policy might be decried by some as dangerous, or sneered at by others as impracticable, he felt that it was inseparably connected with the glory of England and the happiness of the world. These measures, although no longer directed in the cabinet by the intelligent mind of the illustrious statesman with whom they had originated &#x2014;although no longer enforced in this House by his powerful eloquence, his irresistible persuasion, and his unrivalled felicity of diction&#x2014;although the voice was now mute which had once given that enunciation an energy not to be disputed, and the last consolation, which, in the absence of all this living persuasion, the House could have received, had that evening been swept away by the statement of the right hon. gentleman opposite&#x2014;his
<col>536</col>
sentiments with regard to the policy of Mr. Canning remained unchanged, and his opinion of its bearing on the public welfare unaltered; nor could he refrain from looking upon the right hon. gentleman as one who had abandoned those who were most willing to promote his own enlarged and intelligent views, and as having gone over to a body, which was inclined to thwart and to discourage them; and as having, above all, left the party of his late illustrious friend, without a leader, an existence, or a name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00347"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, that his right hon. friend, the Secretary for the Colonies, having appealed to him to confirm the correctness of some parts of the statement which he had made, he had great pleasure in doing so. Of some of the facts he was, as his right hon. friend had truly said, cognizant; and, in respect of these, he was able to bear his most willing testimony. Much discussion had arisen in respect of the principles upon which his noble friend in another House, his right hon. friend near him, and himself, had consented to join the present administration. It had been attempted to be shewn, that they could not have been justified in so joining the new government, unless they had previously obtained sufficient assurance and guarantee, as to the nature of the measures in which they might be called on to concur; and his right hon. friend, in particular, had been accused of abandoning one party in order to join another hostile to his own views of foreign and commercial policy. Now, looking either to their own situation, or to the character of those members of the government with whom they had to deal, it must surely be manifest to the House, that no such stipulations as those suggested that evening, could have been, for one moment, proposed or entertained. But, as had been already observed by his right hon. friend, he and his noble and right hon. friend felt it to be their duty to the public, to parliament, and to themselves, to ascertain, by the most direct and explicit means, what were the opinions and views of the individuals whom they were so invited to join, before they agreed to become constituent members of the government about to be formed. When application, for example, was first made to him, the only answer he could give to a proposal, general in its nature, was, that he should wish, in the first instance, to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0276"/>
<col>537</col>
know of what individuals it was purposed to constitute the government, of which he was so invited to be a member. But, when he found that it was wished that his right hon. friend, the Secretary for the Colonies, should retain his office&#x2014;that his noble friend at the head of the foreign department, should continue in that post, to direct our foreign relations&#x2014;and his right hon. friend, the President of the Board of Trade, to direct the management of our commercial interests, he felt it to be quite unnecessary to seek further as to either the persons or the principles of the new administration. At the same time, he could need no better evidence of the sincerity with which the duke of Wellington must be disposed to carry on the measures to which they were pledged, than the simple fact of their continuance in their former offices. In respect, then, of our foreign relations, our commercial relations, and our general foreign policy, he had found that there existed no obstacles, either on the ground of principle, or of policy, which should oppose his acceding to the proposal to enter into the new government.&#x2014;There was, indeed, a third question, of the greatest importance to the House and the country, to which he wished to allude: he meant the Catholic question, and he would ask, if a line of demarcation ought to be drawn in the choice of ministers merely on that account? There were, unfortunately, two parties, one for, and the other against, that measure; but surely no man could conscientiously say, that this ought to be a barrier against their acting together&#x2014; that this great question should be carried by the simple decision of ministers, or even of the House, without trusting to the opinion of the public. It was by public opinion alone, excited and encouraged by the discussions in parliament, that this measure could ever be fully carried into effect: for, unless the public mind was prepared for the change, it would be worse than useless to adopt it. But even considering, in that point of view, the conduct of those members of the cabinet who had acted with the last ministry, and who had joined the present, they were fully justified in the part which they had taken. In the present cabinet there was a greater number of members who had voted for Catholic emancipation, than there was in that of lord Liverpool: they could have no interest in swaying the public opinion; they had only to look to their own conduct, and

he felt perfectly convinced that on this question, and indeed on every other, whether connected with our policy, foreign or domestic, they had pursued a course which was strictly honourable, and which would bear the strictest investigation. On the Catholic question in particular, they had had the most satisfactory explanation with the noble duke at the head of the government. His grace had stated, that it was his intention to observe the strictest neutrality on that point&#x2014;neither to use his influence in opposing or in forwarding the measure. On that subject, and on every other which had been mentioned to the noble duke, he and his friends had received every explanation and satisfaction, short of such stipulations as men of honour could not grant, nor any man of honour require. After alluding to the fact, that the government of Ireland was intrusted by the present government to the same lord lieutenant and chief secretary which had been designed and appointed by the last, and declaring that the whole of the practice of the government was in exact accordance with the principles of those who preceded them, the noble lord concluded by declaring, that whenever those principles were abandoned, those who joined the present government could still find a security for the maintenance of their own views by retiring from office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00348"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> rose to exculpate his right hon. friend, the Secretary for the Colonies, from the blame of not having before given an explanation, and professed himself ready, to take that blame on himself&#x2014;if blame attached to any person. On the return of his right hon. friend to town, he conveyed to him his belief, that it was the intention' of the gentlemen opposite, to put some questions to him on the Monday following. On Monday his right hon. friend attended in his place, when it was understood that those gentlemen meant to postpone putting their questions till the motion for a Committee of Supply on Wednesday. It was notorious, not only that his right hon. friend did attend in his place that evening, but that he was ready to give every information, and was anxious he should be called on to give it; but when the time came for appointing the Committee of Supply, the intention of questioning his right hon. friend was postponed till the appointment of the Committee of Finance on Friday. His right hon. friend came down to the House that night with the intention of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0277"/>
<col>539</col>
making the explanation, but no opportunity was afforded him. For his part, he would express his satisfaction that the discussion had been delayed until this night; for it had given his right hon. friend an opportunity of reading a letter from Mr. Sheppard, by which he was completely borne out in his own statements, that there was at Liverpool no question of any guarantee, in the sense in which that word had been understood. He had felt at this complete explanation no ordinary satisfaction; for he had sat sixteen years in that House, and had supported the principles, and the line of conduct, followed by his right hon. friend. He had heard with satisfaction, the assurance that the noble duke had given, that this policy was not to be changed; and he was more satisfied on this head, as that assurance did not test on verbal pledges. Not that he was not as much disposed as any man to place his confidence on what that noble person asserted; but circumstances might arise which might make him adopt a new line of policy. But he now saw, by the continuance of three ministers in office, the government pledged in three departments &#x2014;the department of the colonies, the department of commerce and trade, and the foreign department&#x2014;to a continuation of the policy of the late administration. With regard to the Catholic question, he felt not uneasy; as he saw that the noble Secretary at War, who had been introduced into the cabinet on account of that question, had not been removed. His right hon. friend had satisfied him, that that question was still placed on the same basis as it was placed by Mr. Canning. The guarantees received were such, he thought, as were safe and consistent with honour. He could not say that that question was precisely in the same situation when he saw the right hon. member for Oxford who had objected to Mr. Canning's administration, on account of its favouring the Catholics, again in office; but it was his settled conviction, that there was no member of the administration more liberal or more candid, than that right hon. gentleman: and he considered his return to office as a guarantee of the continuance of the liberal policy of the government in our domestic concerns. But, though the government should be disposed to change, it could not be denied that it had been partly impelled into its liberal policy by the House of Commons; and the spirit of that House
<col>540</col>
would still remain to keep the policy of the country consistent with the same principles. It was not possible at present to govern this country by any other than liberal measures. A country like this, wealthy and intelligent, and blessed with free institutions could not be governed in total disregard of the opinions of the people. He was satisfied that the government, as it was now constituted, would pursue a liberal policy; and, as long as it did, it should have his support, and no longer. He felt satisfied, that the noble duke would observe a strict neutrality as to the Catholic question; and, he hoped a more perfect neutrality than was observed by lord Liverpool. He should not be satisfied, however, if the patronage of the Crown was all employed to support the views of those who opposed the Catholic question. That patronage had been employed, not to support the Catholics, but to bribe the most distinguished members of two professions, that they might oppose the Catholics; and thus, not only were the Catholics excluded from power, but the best and most able Protestants were bribed to oppose them. The hon. gentleman concluded by saying, that he should support the government, because he believed that it would have an honest regard to the pledges it had given.</membercontribution></p>

Secretary for the Colonies, although allusion was manifestly made to the circumstance in several places in those letters? The noble lord, lately at the head of the administration, had, in another place, given what was called a very fair account of the early stage of the disorder which had proved fatal to the cabinet; but he should have explained why the head
<image src="S2V0018P0I0278"/>
<col>541</col>
fell nerveless and paralysed to the ground without any notice whatever to the other members. The right hon. gentleman ought to have explained the cause of the dissolution. It was stated by the noble lord, that a dispute arose about the appointment of lord Althorp as chairman of the Finance Committee, which had. produced an irreconcilable breach between two members of the cabinet; but how that breach had been made up, and how the two members continued to sit in the same cabinet, the House had yet to learn. The House and the country, however, must learn from them how they could now sit side by side; how their pulses, which formerly were so irregular, could beat so soon in unison. The House must learn by what means the quietus had been produced, and how the direful wrath had been appeased. These and other circumstances still more complicated the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies had still to explain. There were one or two points, however, to which, without entering at large on the subject, he wished to call the attention of the right hon. gentleman. It had been stated, and never satisfactorily contradicted, that he Had said, that nothing should ever induce him to unite in office with the duke of Wellington and Mr. Peel. He would not, however, ask for so much as this, and would be contented with the belief, that the words used were&#x2014;that "he never would join the destroyers of his lamented friend." This, he believed, was the fact. Now, few virtues were so good and Christian-like as that of forgiveness; but the doctrine varied considerably when it applied to oneself, and when it applied to a friend, and a distinction ought to have been made. He was willing even to believe, that the statement was not correct; but still it had been currently reported, and no attempt had been made to disprove it, or to soften it down, as a noble lord had done in another place, by representing it as a political occurrence which his friends wished to forget. He would only say, however, that if such an assertion had been made, the right hon. gentleman ought to say so, and admit that he ought not to have delivered it. He did not stand up as the champion of Mr. Canning; but he might say, even with the little experience he had, that the House never would be satisfied, unless a more full and satisfactory explanation was given. Several statements had been made and con
<col>542</col>
tradicted: more would follow, and would probably be contradicted also, not only here but elsewhere; and therefore a few more explanations must take place before the question could be set at rest. They must, in fact, be brought to the bar of public opinion; and if their deeds were bad, they should not be allowed to pass unnoticed and uncensured. There was a mystery altogether about the late change, which, he hoped yet to see cleared up, by the rising of the curtain which concealed persons of great consequence, incorporeal as well as corporeal. It had been credibly affirmed, that there was a mysterious personage behind the scene, who concerted, regulated, and influenced, every arrangement. "There is," said the hon. gentleman, "deny it who can, a secret influence behind the throne, whose form is never seen, whose name is never breathed, who has access to all the secrets of the State, and who manages all the sudden springs of ministerial arrangement,&#x2014;
<quote>"At whose soft nod the streams of honour flow, Whose smiles all place and patronage bestow."</quote>
Closely connected with this invisible, this incorporeal person, stands a more solid and substantial form, a new, and formidable power, till these days unknown in Europe; master of unbounded wealth, he boasts that he is the arbiter of peace and war, and that the credit of nations depends upon his nod; his correspondents are innumerable; his couriers outrun those of sovereign princes, and absolute sovereigns; ministers of state are in his pay. Paramount in the cabinets of continental Europe, he aspires to the domination of our own; even the great Don Miguel himself, of whom we have lately heard and seen so much, was obliged to have recourse to the purse of this individual, before he could take possession of his throne. Sir, that such secret influences do exist is a matter of notoriety; they are known to have been but too busy in the underplot of the recent revolution. I believe their object to be as impure as the means by which their power has been acquired, and denounce them and their agents as unknown to the British constitution, and derogatory to the honour of the Crown. He trusted that the duke of Wellington, and the right hon. Secretary for the Home Department, would not allow the finances of this great country to be controlled any longer by a Jew, or the distribution of the patronage

<p id="S2V0018P0-00352"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he did not rise to offer any thing in explanation of the causes of the dissolution of the late administration. Of those causes he knew absolutely nothing; and he was never aware of the existence of the correspondence which had been laid before them that night until he had heard it read. Knowing nothing, then, of those causes beyond what every gentleman knew who read the public papers, no consideration on earth should induce him to enter upon a discussion of them, or to pronounce any opinion. upon them. He could not proceed further without noticing one or two expressions in the speech of the hon. gentleman who had just sat down, as to the mysterious, incorporeal, and incomprehensible, being of which he had spoken. He did not know where it existed. He had, for some years, been in the service of his majesty, and he never was aware that any of the measures of the government had been thwarted by this incomprehensible being, nor had he ever found that the other more substantial personage had interfered, in the way stated by the hon. gentleman, with the financial affairs of the country. As he was perfectly ignorant of the existence of any species of influence like that alluded to by the hon. member, he could not afford him any information upon that point.&#x2014;He was not aware that there was any explanation required by that House from him, regarding the circumstances attendant upon his return to the office which he had the honour to fill. He was ready to answer any question which might be put to him respecting the circumstances and reasons which had induced him to join the present administration. He was willing to state every thing that was material, and should any omission be pointed out to him, he would gladly supply it. Upon the night of the 9th of January, while then residing in Sussex, he received at midnight a letter from his grace the duke of Wellington, stating, that he had been commissioned by his majesty to form a new ministry, and requesting that he would, without delay, return to London, as his grace was anxious to confer with him in the first instance, upon the subject. He left the place where he was residing that night, and arrived in London early on the following morning. He waited
<col>544</col>
immediately upon the duke of Wellington. His grace repeated to him the substance of what he had written; namely, that his majesty had applied to him for the purpose of consulting him respecting the formation of a new administration: he said that he was the first person to whom he had applied, and asked if he was willing to form a part of it. He then asked his grace who was to occupy the situation of prime minister? To which the duke replied, that he believed his majesty intended that he should fill that situation, but that he had requested his majesty, if such were his intention, to postpone his determination a little, in order that he might have an opportunity of making up his mind upon the subject. He then stated to the duke of Wellington, that if he were to stand in the capacity of, prime minister he, (Mr. Peel) for one, was perfectly willing to serve under him in any capacity, and he took that opportunity of stating to the duke his opinion, that, the men most fit for the reconstruction of the cabinet, men whose principles were the most acceptable to himself and to the country, were to be found among those who had formed part of lord Liverpool's administration. He stated to his grace, that, under existing circumstances, he saw-no course so likely to soften down the prejudices of parties as that to which he had alluded. He added, that if he could be satisfied of the duke's becoming prime minister, if his grace also contemplated the resignation of the office of commander-in-chief, he should not hesitate to take a part in his administration. He then said, that if he were at liberty to express his opinion respecting the manner in which the government should be reconstructed, he would then do so, which would also give the noble duke an opportunity of learning how far his opinions were in accordance with his own. He then stated to the noble duke, that, taking into consideration the state of the country, the state of the House of Commons as to the talents of public men there, and the general condition of our foreign and commercial relations, he did not think it consistent with his duty to withhold his opinion, that the country could not be governed upon any exclusive principles. He had stated, that it was impossible to narrow their views to the mere personal opinions which might be entertained by particular men, but that they must carry them much
<image src="S2V0018P0I0280"/>
<col>545</col>
further; and looking, as he had said, to the state of the country generally, and to the state of that House also&#x2014;divided as it was in opinion almost equally upon the Catholic question, the numbers being 276 to 272&#x2014;he believed it to be impossible, with satisfaction to the country, to form a government founded either on the principle of excluding the Catholic question altogether, or of making the carrying of that question a sine qua non. Looking to the agitated state of the commercial and agricultural interests, it did appear to him, that the government should be formed upon such grounds as were not likely to promote one of those interests to the injury of the other, but that it should be so composed as to promote the interests of all. Looking also to the state of Europe, and to that part of it more especially which might be said to be remaining in a state of conflict, he thought that the course which the government should pursue was, a course of moderation, and that it should act as mediator between the contending parties. The duke of Wellington then said, that his own opinions on these subjects were in precise concurrence with his; and that he was happy to find that their views coincided so entirely. &#x2014;Some right hon. gentlemen had thought fit to impute to him, and to some noble and right hon. friends near him, a sacrifice of the opinions which they formerly professed to entertain, by their joining the present government. He should say, in answer to such imputation, that if he had taken any other course than that which he had, he should have been justly chargeable with inconsistency. He had stated in that House, on a former occasion, that the ground on which he had refused to act in the administration of Mr. Canning was the Catholic question, and that alone; and if that could have been put aside, there was no public ground on which he would have refused to act with him as prime minister. He had made that declaration at the time verbally, and he had afterwards put it upon record; namely, about two days before he relinquished the office of Secretary of State for the Home Department. On the 9th of April last&#x2014; and there could be no public inconvenience in referring to the circumstance now&#x2014;the then chancellor, lord Eldon, waited upon him at the command of his majesty, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any change had taken place in
<col>546</col>
the sentiments he had avowed respecting the appointment of Mr. Canning. He had a conversation with lord Eldon on the subject, and said he wished to have an opportunity of explaining himself personally, both to his majesty and to Mr. Canning; but that as he deemed it a matter of some importance, he would also express his opinion on the subject to him. (lord Eldon) in writing. He accordingly did write a letter to the lord Chancellor, of which he would now read a part. This letter was dated April 9:&#x2014;
<quote>"My dear Lord Chancellor,&#x2014;To prevent any misconception, allow me to commit to writing the substance of what I stated to you this morning. I must candidly say, that I wish to see the present government resting on the same footing as it did before lord Liverpool's misfortune. As regards myself, I am content with my situation, and wish for no change; and, with the single exception of the difference of opinion respecting the Catholic question, I am ready to act with them in every other matter. I can assure you, that I esteem and respect them, and should consider it a great misfortune for his majesty to be deprived of the services of any of them, particularly of the services of Mr. Canning. I can say with the greatest truth, that with the single exception of the Catholic question, my opinions are in accordance with theirs."</quote>
This extract would show what his opinions then were, and such they remained. The government which was then formed having been dissolved, how could he refuse to enter again into the king's service? And if he did re-enter it, was he not right in advising the ministry to be reconstructed from those with whom he agreed? There was nothing inconsistent in any thing he had done in this respect; and as to the jealousies and personal animosities towards Mr. Canning, which were so much talked about, he had indulged in. no such feelings. On the day of the date of the above letter, he said, in that House, that the transfer of the office of prime minister from lord Liverpool to Mr. Canning, differing as he did in opinion with that right hon. gentleman on the Catholic question, constituted a great difficulty in, the way of his entering that administration. He felt, upon such an important domestic question, that if he took office, he should, from his situation in the Home Department, necessarily have to come in frequent
<image src="S2V0018P0I0281"/>
<col>547</col>
collision with the head of the government, who differed from him respecting it: and, as he could never, under such circumstances, continue to act with satisfaction to himself, he decided that he could not take part in that administration. But, when the duke of Wellington took the office of prime minister, no such ground of objection existed, and he felt himself at liberty to join his government. His recollection of what passed on the formation of that government was very much in accordance with what had been stated by his noble friend, the Secretary at War, for, from the moment that the duke of Wellington determined that an offer should be made to the members of lord Liverpool's government, the duke said, "let us put the matter to them fairly and freely upon public grounds." No stipulations were offered or required, but there was a spontaneous desire on the duke's part, to make such propositions to those individuals as must prove acceptable to all. The duke felt the importance of preserving unchanged the existing policy respecting the general affairs of Europe, especially as concerned the affairs in the East; and he felt also, that it would be a great public advantage to secure the valuable assistance of earl Dudley in the Foreign-office. On the 10th of January the noble duke had assured him, that no change should take place in the government of Ireland; and although some dissatisfaction had been expressed, in some quarters, respecting the appointment of the right hon. gentleman who was secretary for that country, he could only say, that if it were left to name any person to that office, he could not select an individual better qualified than that right hon. gentleman.&#x2014; Respecting the Catholic question, every member of the present administration was at liberty to take what line of conduct he might choose: it was deemed to be an open question; and the patronage of Ireland was to remain neutral, as it was pledged to be in Mr. Canning's government. The noble duke had agreed in opinion with him on these points; and he believed that it was his intention to act steadily and honestly up to the declarations which he had made upon this subject.&#x2014;With respect to the corn question, that had been referred to as a reason why a union never could take place between the remnant of two former administrations. Now, what-fever was the value of the objection, it did
<col>548</col>
not apply to him. He had expressed no dissent from the principles of the corn bill brought in by Mr. Canning: and, in fact, at the time when Mr. Canning's state of health rendered it doubtful whether he could bring it forward, it had been agreed that, in the right hon. gentleman's absence, he should introduce it to the House. A noble lord opposite (Milton) had spoken of the amendment moved by the duke of Wellington upon that bill, which ended in its rejection; and had inferred that, from that event, there could be no junction in a government between the noble duke and the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies. Now, he denied that there was any evidence that the duke of Wellington was hostile to the principle of that bill. He had sat in the cabinet when it was introduced; he had voted for the second reading of it; and there was nothing, as regarded principle, which could be objected to him for having altered the details. The amendment which the noble duke had moved to the bill which had been lost, formed no bar to his supporting another bill brought in upon similar principles. But the fact was, that a consistency and a unanimity of opinion was called for, or affected to be called for, in the members of the government, which it was folly to suppose ever could exist. In consenting to become a member of an administration, he did not surrender, or believe that he was bound to surrender, his opinions to any man. He protested that he never would enter the service of the Crown, or of the country, if the terms were, that he was implicitly to adopt the views of any minister&#x2014;of lord Liverpool, of the duke of Wellington, or of Mr. Canning. With respect to the last-mentioned right hon. gentleman, if the Catholic question could have been put out of sight, and if Mr. Canning had asked him to become a member of his administration, he should have answered&#x2014;" There are matters on which we do not think alike; but we have sat in the same cabinet for five years, and I know of no cause which should preclude me from serving with you, or under you." For, could it be supposed that any head of an administration ought to expect&#x2014;or would any one who acted with him consent that he should be permitted&#x2014;to lay down his personal opinions like a formula, to which every one about him was bound, without objection or qualification, to subscribe? He repeated, that he would have
<image src="S2V0018P0I0282"/>
<col>549</col>
served with the late Mr. Canning, or under him. He saw no point on which he ought to have declined to do so, except the single point of the Catholic question. A noble lord had spoken of the policy of the South American question, and of the expedition to Portugal. He had concurred in the South American policy. He believed that many of the South American colonies had, at the time in question, established a <i>de facto</i> independence of the mother country, and that it was time that that independence should be formally acknowledged. As for the expedition of Portugal&#x2014;he found Portugal in a state of danger which gave him every disposition to act, and as the question stood, he was not bound to call principle to his aid upon the subject, for we found the country bound by treaties, from which it was impossible, in honour or in justice, for her to depart. He did not stand there as the <i>" laudator temporis acti," </i>but he repeated&#x2014;that perfect agreement in any administration could not, and ought not, to be looked for. It could not fairly exist. He was ready to serve in the government, if he could; but never unless he were allowed to retain his own views and feelings upon ten thousand possible questions, which, in the complicated state of society, would arise, and to provide for which, by any arrangement or settlement of principle, was impossible. He thought that the proposal which the noble duke at the head of affairs had made to the members of the present administration was one which it was impossible for any of them to reject; unless those who meant to say, that the fact of their once having been in office under Mr. Canning precluded them from taking office under anybody else. The explanations given upon this point seemed to him fully satisfactory. The hon. member who spoke last gave little encouragement to explanation, when he declared, that he would not be satisfied although parties should go on explaining to eternity; but he believed that every circumstance which required notice had been accounted for. The same hon. member charged his right hon. friend, the Secretary for the Colonies, with having given a pledge to his friends and to the country, that he never would take office under the duke of Wellington, or&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00353"><member>Mr. T. Duncombe</member><membercontribution> said, "No." He had merely said that which was the fact; namely, that the right hon. gentleman had declared he never would act with those
<col>550</col>
who caused the destruction of Mr. Canning.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00354"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> continued. He would not moot the point with the hon. gentleman; for the principle was that which he desired to go upon. Was there never to be an end of the desire to make every transient hostility interminable? The noble lord at the head of the Foreign Affairs had treated this dangerous and unreasonable desire as it deserved, when he had spoken of the praise which was due to Mr. Canning, for having forgotten his personal difference with the late marquis of Londonderry, the instant that the country seemed likely to be assisted by their union. For himself, he could only say, that if it was a point of honour to recollect one's own quarrels, or the quarrels of one's friends, he thought it an act incomparably more noble, to forget those animosities when the public interest would be served by burying them in oblivion. He hoped, therefore, most sincerely, that there would be an end of these demands for explanation, and of explanation itself, as of every other circumstance which could tend to impede that cordial union for the promotion of the public welfare, which he was sure, if it was permitted to do so, would distinguish the conduct of the present ministry. If government was allowed to take its course, as much unanimity and as much exertion would mark the administration of the duke of Wellington, as had distinguished any ministry that had ever existed in the country; certainly as much as could belong to any ministry capable of being formed in the existing state of parties. He trusted that what had been done already, since the business of the session had commenced, had evinced at least a disposition, from which no evil to the country would be expected. As far as he was concerned, his object should be to do that which he had recommended; namely, to forget all differences which had existed, and to ask only, how far the expectations of the public from the government as it stood was likely to be realized. He had never sought to be recalled to office. His being replaced in it was neither of his asking nor of his particular desire: but, since he was in office, he would steadily perform that which he believed to be his duty: he would execute the trust which, in taking place, he had contracted with the Crown and with the nation; especially aiming to promote the union of the minis-

<col>551</col>
try with which he was connected, and to avoid exciting any differences by which its stability could be endangered.&#x2014;One word more was all with which he would detain the House. It referred to a subject which it was right should be fully understood, as connected with the dissolution of the late ministry and the formation of the present. On the 8th of January, when his majesty had commissioned the noble duke at the head of affairs to form a new government, his majesty had accompanied his commands for that purpose with the following declaration:&#x2014;"I commit to you the formation of a new ministry: the last administration has been dissolved. But it is my duty to inform you, that, if that administration had not been dissolved by acts of its own, I would have remained faithful to it to the last." There were circumstances which made it expedient that this fact should be known. For himself, he believed it was impossible to attribute the dissolution of the late government, to any other than the causes which had been brought before the House in the course of the explanations of the evening. He repeated, that he thought there had been discussion enough. If there was any point connected with his personal acceptance of office that wanted explanation, he was ready to give it to any member who might call upon him. But he thought his right hon. colleagues had gone as far as it was necessary, or possible, for them to go.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00355"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> rose to explain. He said, he trusted that his peculiar situation would excuse his intrusion upon the House for a few moments. The declaration of the hon. member opposite, as to what he had heard of his pledge not to join the opponents of Mr. Canning&#x2014;those words of his which the hon. member had converted into a pledge, and which he could only have heard by some scandalous violation of private confidence&#x2014;had been so much talked of and so grossly misrepresented, that he would state what they really were. He had never uttered any thing like the words that were imputed to him; namely, "that he would never again take office with those who had persecuted Mr. Canning to the death"&#x2014;to the death, or to destruction; for it mattered little what the precise expression was which was thus sought to be put into his mouth. What he had said was this&#x2014;when he returned to England in August, he had used the expression, that "his wounds were too
<col>552</col>
green, and too fresh, to admit of his serving in the same ministry with those who had deserted the service of their country when the ministry of his friend, Mr. Canning, had been formed." He complained scarcely less of the violation, of private confidence which would have betrayed his real words, than of their conversion into the monstrous calumny which he had now refuted; but there was a difference, and a wide one, between his speaking of his feelings while his wounds were green and fresh, and a declaration of hostility, which was to bind his conduct to eternity. The right hon. gentleman went on to justify himself against the want of confidence imputed to him by the right hon. member for Knaresborough. If there had been any design or any cabal, to him it was entirely unknown. So late as the 26th of December, he had the firmest intention of remaining in the councils of the country. Of this he could not give a stronger proof than by stating, that after that time two persons of great eminence, politically opposed to him, had intimated plainly, that the embarrassments of the government were so evident, that some measures ought to be taken, and that they were disposed to address the king upon the subject. To this communication he had answered, that the point was one upon which he could give no opinion; but that, whatever resolution they might take, he thought they ought decidedly to state it first to lord Goderich. It was in consequence of this occurrence, that lord Goderich had waited on his majesty on the 8th of January; and at that time he had absolutely not been aware whether the noble lord went to submit his grievances to the king, or to propose some plan by which those grievances might be remedied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00356"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, that at so late an hour he should not be suspected of intending to trespass long upon the patience of the House. Indeed, the subject in debate was one upon which an immense deal of what was needless had already been said, and upon which it might have been sufficient, by taking up the question at the right point, to have said very little. The right hon. gentleman, the late chancellor of the Exchequer, had explained to the House every thing but the short facts which it was desirous to have explained. As to the few material points which had, been suggested by the noble opener of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0284"/>
<col>553</col>
debate, there had been a very abundant discussion upon all the other topics, but upon those the country was nearly as much in the dark as ever. As the story stood, it illustrated the well-known saying of chancellor Oxtenstern to his son.&#x2014;" You see with how little wisdom the world can be governed." The whole of the late ministry appeared to have been in a doubt for some time, whether it was the ministry at all, or whether office belonged to some other party, and was vested in some other place. Two members of the cabinet were walking about in considerable uncertainty whether they belonged to the cabinet or not. The head of the government was chiefly distinguished for always moving about with the resignations of two of his chief officers in his pockets; and for an apparent alarm, when they left him, as to what he should do to provide himself with new ones. Then the letter of the right hon. the present master of the Mint made a considerable figure in the scene: it answered all questions, and was referred to in all emergencies. The noble lord at the head of Administration was terrified lest he should lose his chancellor of the Exchequer. But the right hon. gentleman was inexorable, and constantly referred to his letter of the 22d of December. "But pray do not resign," said the noble lord at the head of affairs. "My letter of the 22d of December," said the chancellor of the Exchequer. "But I am agitated beyond measure," said the noble lord. "My letter of the 22d of December," continued the chancellor of the Exchequer. The noble lord pleaded almost in tears; but still the stony-hearted chancellor of the Exchequer pointed to his letter of the 22d of December. In short, not a word could be got out of the right hon. gentleman, but a stern reference to his letter of the 22d of December&#x0021; Then the quarrel between the two right hon. gentlemen opposite was of the most extraordinary description. It was endless, hopeless, walls of brass were raised to divide the contending parties for ever. To communicate with each other was impossible. Then both parties communicated to a third person; but still, each with a caution, that what he said was, on no account, to be repeated to the other. Every possible course resorted to, to avoid the possibility of a reasonable explanation, which would have put an end to the difficulty altogether. This was the state of
<col>554</col>
things in the cabinet: in the House of Commons it was scarcely more intelligible. The right hon. the master of the Mint spoke of his anxiety to make up the government: but the proceedings taken to that end were the most extraordinary it was possible to conceive. For lord Goderich, he could bear witness to the conduct of that noble lord while a member of the House of Commons; and he had no hesitation in declaring, that the country was indebted to him for his services there. The honourable feeling and amiable disposition of the noble lord were the theme of commendation by all who knew him: and he must say, that he felt a good deal surprised at the tone of sarcasm in which the late chancellor of the Exchequer had spoken of the noble lord. For himself, he was not surprised that the noble lord had been distracted, surrounded as he was with such elements of discord as the House had seen that night. If any one wanted the history of his distress, the two right hon. gentlemen on the other side had given a very good account of it. For how could any man alive, unless he was a military man as well as a politician, have controlled and quelled the tumults of the right hon. gentleman. Unless he was a soldier with a provost-martial at his back, how could he reduce them to any show of order? The only chance for a civilian would have been to have carried them both to Bow-street, and have had them sworn to keep the peace, before he swore them in members of the cabinet. All which were measures of discipline too strict for the mild and amiable character of lord Goderich to resort to. The facts, however, of the right hon. the late chancellor of the Exchequer, in his address to the House, were peculiarly worthy of attention. The right hon. gentleman scoffed at the thought of his having broken up the late ministry. He said that it was a joke, a farce, a hollow pretext, and twenty other things beside, to accuse him of having broken up the government. The dissolution was brought on by some other cause&#x2014;by a design, an intrigue, a cabal, to dissolve the administration.</membercontribution></p>

<col>555</col>
friend on his right hand. But it was a matter of no consequence. It should not be called a cabal, but a simple design, a plan, any thing the right hon. gentleman thought fit. That such a plan, or design, however, did form part of the right hon. gentleman's argument was beyond denial; and the right hon. gentleman had put the fact in the strongest way. He said, "I know it." The House would not forget those words, from the loud cheers by which they had been followed. The high Tory party&#x2014;who supported the right hon. gentleman because they knew that he would go any lengths to serve them, consistently with his duty&#x2014;as soon as they heard the words, "I know it," uttered a cheer which rent the House; upon which the right hon. gentleman had repeated the words, 'with an appeal to the table, as could be testified by the hon. members near him. Now, as a constitutional lawyer, he would offer an opinion to the House. He entirely agreed with his right hon. friend, the member for Knaresborough, that if any person, being of the privy council, conceived a design to put an end to the king's government&#x2014;if any party (also of the privy council) knew of that design, not being himself a sharer in it, and did not disclose it to the king, that person's secrecy was an impeachable offence. Now, let the House mark&#x2014;no sooner did the right hon. the late chancellor of the Exchequer hear this opinion of the right hon. member for Knaresborough, than he straightway began to explain, that he had not meant to say that he knew the thing, but only that he must have known it. Presently it came to this that he had reason to conclude, to infer, to think, and so forth. The right hon. gentleman also, in his extreme modesty, found a cause why he could not have dissolved the government. It was impossible that so insignificant a person as he was in the cabinet could have accomplished such an act. Now the right hon. gentleman in this point, certainly did himself injustice: it was impossible that a gentleman, who had been near breaking up a government in August, and absolutely did break up one in January, could be properly called insignificant.&#x2014;The hon. and learned gentleman then proceeded to examine the letters of lord Goderich and Mr. Herries, and contended that, from those letters, it appeared that, at the time when that right hon. gentleman complained of having
<col>556</col>
been overlooked and neglected in the appointment of lord Althorp, he must have known that that appointment was not finally decided upon. It had been talked of, and with the approbation of lord Goderich. The letter of lord Goderich distinctly stated, not that he was not a party to the mention of the appointment, but that it was not final. Early in December, the right hon. gentleman was acquainted with the fact, that nothing finally was concluded upon. He was informed of what was done, and made no objection; and yet, three weeks afterwards, he talked of having arrangements made behind his back, and of the caballing, planning, appointing, determining, and finally arranging, a matter in which he ought to have been, but was not, officially consulted. But another ray of light broke in upon them in this matter. That was the letter of lord Goderich in January. That letter, which went into a detail so long, that it might be called prolix, clearly showed, that the right hon. gentleman was mistaken. It admonished him on the subject of his mistake, and advised him to reconsider his offer of resignation. After all these repeated communications, the right hon. gentleman complained that it was intended to thwart him in his office. What object could the right hon. the member for Liverpool, or the right hon. the member for Knaresborough, have in thwarting him? They both denied it, and declared, that, from the time of his appointment, they had uniformly behaved towards him with the greatest kindness. What, then, could be meant by the complaint of being thwarted? The House had, upon this occasion, been let a little into the secret of the manner in which part of the business in that House was arranged. It appeared that one member of the cabinet pulled out from his pocket a list of some seventy names, from which the committee was to be selected. Many hon. members imagined, in their simplicity, that, the House elected committees of this kind, but no such thing. From the secrets which had slipped out, it seemed that though they were permitted to go through the form, they were spared the trouble of the selection. One member, pulling out his list, said, "have you any objection to this or that man?" and the other replied, by asking whether there was any objection to another. And they not only saved the House the trouble of electing the committee, but even the committee
<image src="S2V0018P0I0286"/>
<col>557</col>
was not allowed to elect its chairman. Some intelligent member of the cabinet not only anticipated the names of the men whom the House were to choose as the committee, but also the name of the individual whom that committee were to select as their chairman; and he had never found that those anticipations were not accurate.&#x2014;But to return. The right hon. gentleman had stated, that he was too insignificant to blow up the government, and the inference he would have the House to draw was, that the destruction of that ministry was preconcerted. Now, let the House consider what were the objections of the right hon. gentleman to lord Althorp &#x2014;that he was a party man. Why, the reverse of that was the cause why he had been named, in the first instance. He had never been recognized as a party man. He was at the head of a set of gentlemen who acted independently, without reference to the views of any party. But, it appeared that lord Althorp stood committed on the bullion question, and had given a strong opinion respecting the sinking-fund. Were the committee, he begged to ask, to be precluded from making any inquiries respecting the bullion question? Were they not to inquire into the expenditure, into the rise of salaries, in consequence of the depreciation of the currency, into the increase of taxes, as the result of the same cause 1 If they were not, they need not send to Downing-street for the appointment of a committee; they could appoint one themselves, and it would not be difficult to get those who would move and second a motion for such a committee. When he said this, he begged to be understood as not meaning to quarrel with the committee. It was as fair a committee as he could desire; by one third fairer than any Finance Committee he had before seen. He augured well from its formation; and he had no doubt that it would inquire into the rise of salaries, into the increase of taxes, and into the bullion question. That question was at the root of all these&#x2014;the sinking-fund was only part and parcel. Yet the late chancellor of the Exchequer, because he considered lord Althorp as committed on the bullion question, was prepared rather to resign On the 21st of December, than consent to that appointment; although the right hon. gentleman had not objected to the appointment of sir H. Par-nail, a gentleman who was not only commit
<col>558</col>
ted on the bullion question, but had written a book upon it. He had spoken on the subject a hundred times, and always with effect. He had moved finance resolutions over and over again, in which the sinking-fund was mentioned; he was a political economist, at the head of a set of political economists, and was even a member of the political economists' club; and yet, with all these qualities, so objectionable in the eyes of the late chancellor of the Exchequer, he had made no sort of objection whatever to his appointment; though, rather than consent to the nomination of lord Althorp with only one of those objectionable qualities, he was prepared on the 21st of December to resign his situation. The right hon. gentleman could not consent to this appointment, as it derogated from his dignity: about that dignity he was quite solicitous, so as to be angry with lord Goderich's administration, and yet at a nod or a beck from the duke of Wellington he became mild as a lamb. The moment the field marshal gave the word of command, he was all obedience, and gave up, without a murmur, his office of chancellor of the Exchequer, resigned the golden gown, in which he (Mr. B.) had seen him sworn into office in the court of Exchequer, and retired to the less dignified, the less responsible, and certainly the less lucrative, office of Master of his majesty's Mint.&#x2014;The hon. and learned gentleman went on to say, that they had now sat till two o'clock in the morning, and he who began the discussion was not better informed on the subject than at the outset. He had heard many statements, and much anecdote, some of a gay and some of a more serious character; but something untold still remained behind, which would have explained the matter at once. Would it not have been better to say at once," you wish for information as to the cause of the late break up, but I will not tell you? "For his own part, however well others had acquitted themselves in this explanation, he must confess that the statement of the right hon. gentleman had given him no satisfaction; it still left some doubts on his mind; the shifting of his ground, first assenting, or at least not objecting, to the appointment of lord Althorp, afterwards protesting against it, and then attributing the dissolution of the ministry to a preconcerted plan on the part of others.&#x2014;As to the statement of the right hon. gentle
<image src="S2V0018P0I0287"/>
<col>559</col>
man who spoke last, he was surprised he should have found it necessary to occupy the time of the House in making a defence, where there was no charge. It was true he had obtained a triumph, if that could be called a triumph, where there was no antagonist. It reminded him of a person who had gone into a court of justice, and having got himself into the dock, and seeing' a jury in the box, demanded to be put upon his trial; but on being informed that he could not be tried, as there was no charge against him, left the dock, boasting of his triumphant acquittal. The right hon. gentleman boasted of the consistency of his conduct, in resigning office in April last, and re-entering it at present. That, however, was not the question. Why had not some of his right hon. friends near him imitated that conduct, and declined office for a similar reason; namely, that the person at the head of the government possessed too much influence upon a question which they held to be so important to the country? &#x2014;As to the lengthened statement of the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies, to prove that he had not got a guarantee, it was wholly unnecessary. Did any man believe that it could have been meant that he had got a guarantee in the legal sense of the word? A guarantee should be written, and on a stamp. By the statute of frauds, for preventing corrupt practices, no guarantee could be legal unless it was in writing, and on a proper stamp. Now, he would ask, was it necessary for the right hon. gentleman to show that he had not a guarantee of that description? Beyond that, then, the statement of the right hon. gentleman did not go, on the subject of pledges or guarantees. Still, however that statement was the most important they had heard that night. If a man spoke to an audience of having had conversations, explanations, and understandings, with another on a particular subject would they not apply those conversations explanations, and understandings, to that subject, just as much as if it were written would the million in Ireland understand these conversations, &amp;c, to apply to the policy of the measures of one or other on the parties with whom they were had would it not be said, that explanation was the result of conversation, and that the result of that explanation, in the case before the House, was the acceptance of office by the right hon. gentleman?, But it
<col>560</col>
was said, that the guarantees were understood to be implied by the presence, in the same cabinet, of the Secretary for Ireland, the President of the Board of Trade, and the noble Secretary at War. Were these the guarantees? He was afraid the public would not so consider them. Let the House look to the situation of Ireland, and ask, whether a change for the better had taken place.&#x2014;The learned gentleman here alluded to the late sentence of eighteen months' imprisonment against Mr. Eneas Macdonnell, in Dublin, for a libel on archdeacon French; and after remarking that it was much more severe than the punishment of many atrocious libels against some of the highest personages in this country, asked, could any man doubt that the judges who sentenced Mr. Macdonnell considered, not that they had the author of a libel on Mr. French before them, but the active, and zealous, and persevering, agent of that hated body, the Catholic Association. Then it was said, that the right hon. gentleman had a guarantee for the foreign policy of the country in the person of lord Dudley. But who sat on the same bench with him, as member of the same cabinet? A young nobleman, who certainly possessed hereditary claims to great sagacity, and yet, somehow or other, had not yet succeeded in establishing himself in the possession. That young nobleman had stated, that he had never been opposed to the foreign policy of Mr. Canning, yet he could not disguise the fact, that he had always been of opinion, and in that his opinion remained unchanged, that Mr. Canning was a dangerous man. Yet these were the discordant materials, of which the guarantees for the policy of Mr. Canning were made up &#x0021; As to the guarantee for free trade in the person of a right hon. gentleman (Mr. C. Grant), the House, without in any way detracting from that gentleman's merit, would know what value to set upon it when they recollected the events of last summer, and saw in them an efficient counter-guarantee in the policy of the duke of Wellington. One point more he would advert to. He meant the dilemma between which the late under Secretary for the Colonies (Mr. Stanley), whose talents all admired, had placed some members of the present, who had belonged to the late ministry. Either the members who resigned when Mr. Canning became prime minister did so from personal hatred to him, or from opposition to his
<image src="S2V0018P0I0288"/>
<col>561</col>
principles. If they went out from the former feeling, it snowed a disposition at once weak and contemptible, and such as should ever prevent any friend of Mr. Canning's from joining with them; if from hostility to Mr. Canning's principles, how could those who affected to be guided by those principles, take office under men who had thus publicly opposed them? This was an argument to which he had heard no answer; and he believed it would be very difficult to give a good one. &#x2014;Upon the subject of the construction of this new administration there would still be much to say, as well as with reference to the treatment experienced by that lamented person, to whom allusion had so frequently been made. He wished to abstain from touching further upon this topic. He was not about to bring a charge against any man, nor indeed to find fault with any person's conduct. Those to whom he referred must have feelings by I which they were swayed; and to the operation of those feelings, of which they ought to be the best judges, he left them, But, while he made this allusion to one class of the members of the late government, there was another, from which he could not withhold his highest admiration, for the display of generous and dignified feeling which had characterized their uniform conduct&#x2014;unawed by power, or deterred by the weak and childish effeminacy of abstaining from the manifestation of feelings which, when true, always did honour to human nature&#x2014;in coining forward feelingly and gallantly to rescue the memory of their departed friend, from the unsafe keeping of some of his surviving colleagues.&#x2014;For his own part, seeing the manner in which this government had been abolished, and afterwards so re-constructed, to the exclusion of some men with whom the parties had professed to act while in office, and the admission of others with whom they had not had the same degree of cordiality, the excluded being those in whom the public were, he believed, disposed to place implicit confidence&#x2014;he confessed he could not anticipate much from the change which had recently taken place. With respect to those who no longer formed a part of the administration, he might now and then have thought of some of them, that they had failed a little in the exhibition of that promptitude and firmness, which ought to; belong to persons of their reputation and
<col>562</col>
character. As this had, he knew, been more especially said of lord Lansdowne, of whom it had been insinuated, that he had not put himself sufficiently forward, so as to have prevented all this mischief, by acting in resistance to these machinations, with the vigour and firmness which became him, he wished to say, that the vindication of lord Lansdowne's conduct did not belong to him, while that noble lord himself was so much better capable of sustaining it; but he would nevertheless take leave to say, that no charge was more unfair than that which would attach this degree of responsibility to one who was placed in so delicate and perplexing a situation; that such a man, possessing boundless fortune, great and commanding talents, equanimity and magnanimity of temper, the highest virtue, the most extensive popularity, should be placed in the: altered government&#x2014;not first, but something like second, and at times, hardly that&#x2014;was, indeed, a perplexing and harassing position: it was one of too equivocal, too uncertain, a character, to enable him to put forward&#x2014;indeed, it rendered impossible that he should put forward&#x2014;that manly vigour of character which he knew that noble lord eminently to possess, from a more than thirty years' intimate acquaintance, qualities which he knew naturally and habitually to belong to him. For his noble friend to be charged by his worst enemies, at this, which he might call advanced, period of his public life, with only wanting the forwardness of pert intermeddling and interference, was a high gratification to his friends. It was to say of him this, and it was no small praise, that, as in his early years his character had been tempered with the discretion and foresight which other men could only attain at riper years, so in his maturer age, he united the experience of his more confirmed character, with the modesty of youth.</membercontribution></p>

<col>563</col>
with extreme surprise, a question put a few nights ago, to the noble duke at the head of the government, as to whether or not he intended to bring forward any measure for the relief of the Catholics. This surprised him very much, when he recollected that the noble lords opposite had been nine months at the head of the government, and had never ventured to propose any measure of this nature to parliament. They had then found out, that it was not the season for promoting the cause of the Catholics; and though they had been so long clothed with the outward and visible signs of authority, they had not taken one step, in favour of the Catholics. But, hardly ten days after his noble friend had taken office, he was asked, whether he had any measure to bring forward? In his opinion this was only done to excite the intemperance of the Catholics. He lamented the conduct of the Catholics, and he hoped some legislative measures would be adopted to prevent the continuance of the acts of the Catholic Association. They collected the Catholic rent, which amounted to five or six hundred pounds a week. Such sums were not collected for any good purpose, and could not serve the cause of the Catholics. They could only hope for success by the progress of opinion in this country: and to promote that, they must act with patience, resignation, and obedience, to the laws. By this alone could their object be ultimately obtained, and not by violence and disorder.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00361">On the motion of adjournment,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00362"><member>Lord Goderich</member><membercontribution> rose, and said:&#x2014;It is with great pain, I can assure your lordships, I feel myself under the necessity of again calling your lordships' attention to a personal subject, with reference to the topic on which I addressed your lordships in the course of last week. In what I then threw out, I was anxious not to say any thing that might offend the feelings, or affect the character, of any individual. My object was to justify my own conduct and not to complain of, or to make out a case against, others. I had no wish to reflect on any individuals, or say any thing but to state the whole truth, the plain truth, and nothing but the truth. How, my lords, could I state, for I had no motives to state, what was not absolutely necessary to make your lordships acquainted with the truth? If the observations to which I allude had only re-
<col>564</col>
flected on my fitness to fill the office which I lately held, I should have passed them by in silence; but I cannot forbear to say something, because, if the imputations cast upon me be true, they would make me ashamed to show my face before your lordships. It is now imputed to me, that what I stated to his majesty was a false pretence; that I had a covert design to dissolve the government, and that I acted from some profound calculation. I should have thought, my lords, that what the world knew of me would have been sufficient to save me from any imputation of this kind; and I can hardly believe that such imputation has been made; but if it has, there can be no justification for such conduct. My lords, it is imputed to me, that I went down to his majesty with a statement that was not correct; and that the immediate cause which led to the precarious situation of the government was not that which I stated it to be. If the immediate cause was not the resignation of the chancellor of the Exchequer as I stated it to be, then am I the basest of mankind. But it is impossible I could be guilty of such baseness. When I wrote to the chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject of the committee, I told him in the plainest terms what was the opinion of my right hon. friend. I stated that he considered it impossible for him not to acquiesce in the nomination of the chairman of the Finance Committee, which had been the subject of discussion. My right hon. friend stated, that if the decision should be against that nomination, he would resign; and I stated also that the resignation of the Secretary of State would dissolve the government. I added to this, that his own resignation would, in all probability, be attended with the same consequences. How, then, could the right hon. gentleman state&#x2014;how could any man state&#x2014;that I went down to his majesty with a false pretence, to procure the dissolution of the government? Whether my proceeding was right or wrong is, perhaps, of little consequence, but the statement which I made was the sole ground of my actions; and I defy any man to say that I acted from any other. I went on the following day; I have letters here, my lords, which will prove this to your lordships, and they are at your service. On the next day I stated my opinion to the right hon. gentleman. I recommended him to reconsider his decision
<image src="S2V0018P0I0290"/>
<col>565</col>
I told him I could not accede to his opinion. I urged him not to take the step he contemplated. He said he would take it; and I foresaw the consequences. I added, that we owed it to ourselves, to our king, and the country, not to break up the government, unless it was absolutely necessary. It was our duty, I said, to meet parliament and wait its decision. All this proved ineffectual. The right hon. gentleman referred to his original letter, in which he said he would resign, unless the nomination was changed. What ground, then, was there for the declaration, that I went to his majesty with a false pretence? I say that the conduct of the right hon. gentleman was the immediate cause of the dissolution of the government. These were the motives for my conduct; and it is not possible for any person justly to impute to me any other. It was with me a conclusive reason that there was a tender of a resignation, and it is an imputation made against me that this did not take place. Your lordships will also have seen it represented&#x2014;though I cannot say whether correctly or not&#x2014;but that there existed a design, a plot, to break up the government. My lords, who entertained it? When was it concocted? I positively deny that I knew any thing of it; and I deny that any person, as far as I know, had any such design. I will not say that circumstances had not occurred which might make the government not receive the countenance and support of parliament; but that there was a design to alter or change the government, or to break it up, is a most gratuitous assumption. It is not necessary for me, however, to trouble your lordships with a repetition of all the topics I before adverted to; in doing which, I might, with a view only to defend myself, introduce new matter for discussion, and new matter for controversy in both Houses of parliament. If what has been imputed to me had only affected my character as a minister, I should not have said one word; but I felt that I should not have done justice to my character as a gentleman, if 1 had not stated to your lordships, that I am incapable of going with a false pretence to impose upon the king&#x2014;that I am incapable of betraying my sovereign; as, at least in appearance, is imputed to me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00363"><member>The Earl of Carlisle</member><membercontribution> said, he thought it his duty, having been connected with the
<col>566</col>
late government, to say one word in corroboration of what had just fallen from his noble friend. It was with the greatest surprise that he had heard that it had been stated, in another place, that the difference of opinion between two right hon. gentlemen had not been the cause of the dissolution of the late government; no other cause was assigned at the time in his hearing, and he confessed himself entirely ignorant of any mysterious knowledge of secret machinery and secret intrigue, employed in the dissolution of that government. The cause which had been stated by his noble friend was, as far as his information extended, the real and immediate cause of that event. He felt that his noble friend needed not the vindication of his testimony and assurance; he considered him utterly incapable of palming a spurious, and if spurious, a dishonest and dishonourable, cause of action upon his colleagues and his sovereign.&#x2014;Under these circumstances, it was scarcely necessary to corroborate the statement of his noble friend.<lb/>
Being upon his legs, and as explanations were the order of the day, he begged the House to allow him to offer a few words in explanation of his own conduct. He assured noble lords, that it was with great reluctance that he obtruded upon them any observations that applied almost exclusively to himself; but he was, in some measure, relieved from the difficulty, by referring to a document, not indeed regularly before their lordships, but which had been frequently quoted, in the course of the late discussions. He meant a speech purporting to have been lately made at Liverpool; no part of that speech was more correct than that which represented him to have been an old and personal friend of a right hon. gentleman now unfortunately no more. It was a friendship that existed from a very early date of their respective lives; it continued amidst the fluctuations and differences, the jars and contentions, of political life, steady and uninterrupted: it was a friendship, the remembrance of which he should cherish to the latest period of his existence. He would not now dwell upon the manner in which his departed friend had been persecuted when alive, nor on the political rancour with which he had been assailed: even death conferred no immunity, the grave to him was no sanctuary. He had heard, with great regret, a noble lord
<image src="S2V0018P0I0291"/>
<col>567</col>
(Ellenborough) describe him as "a dangerous minister." If he was dangerous, it was a danger which the people who supported and encouraged him, the sovereign who selected and protected him, wilfully and deliberately incurred; if he was a dangerous minister it was a danger not felt by those states of Europe that enjoyed the benefits of free institutions: it was a danger not felt by a great power that did not possess that advantage, but whose esteem he had conciliated, in a most important and useful degree.<lb/>
But he had been led away, by the mention of the right hon. gentleman, from the explanation of his own conduct. The existence of the friendship to which he had just referred rendered him, at the time of the formation of the late government, a proper channel of communication between his right hon. friend and his noble friend (lord Lansdowne). The result of that negotiation was, as is well known, the accession of his noble friend to the late cabinet. Upon the dissolution of the late government, and the formation of the present, under the auspices of the noble duke, the existence of that friendship placed him in rather a different position from that occupied by the noble marquis. He would not enter into the detail of transactions connected with the formation of the government in which he was at all personally concerned; but he must say, that considering that he had been instrumental in promoting the accession of the noble marquis to the late government&#x2014;considering his upright and manly conduct&#x2014;considering how much he approved of his political principle and the tenour of his political life&#x2014;he could not reconcile to his private feeling, or his sense of public duty, the separation of his political fate from that of the noble marquis. He had retired, therefore, but with no feelings of disappointment, or mortification. He retired, on the contrary, impressed with a deep sense of the gracious condescendance of his sovereign, and to the noble duke, now at the head of the government, he had to offer his grateful acknowledgments, for the conduct he had held with regard to him. He apologized to the House for having obtruded upon them any detail of a matter personal to himself; but he thought that any one who had occupied a public station, if the occasion justified or required it, should not hesitate to lay before them, the mo-
<col>568</col>
tives and principles which had guided and regulated his public conduct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00364"><member>The Earl of Morley</member><membercontribution> said, that reference having been made, by his noble friend who had just sat down, to the principles and ministry of the great statesman whose loss was so generally lamented, he was desirous of offering a few observations to the House. He was the more anxious to do so, as he was in that House certainly the first adherent of that right hon. gentleman; and further, because it had appeared, from a former debate, that some difference of opinion existed amongst those who had been connected with Mr. Canning, as to the line of conduct which it was, under existing circumstances, most accordant with their honour and consistency to adopt. Various theories had, at different times, been maintained, as to the support which those selected by the Crown to conduct its affairs were, upon general grounds, entitled to claim from their lordships, and the other branch of the legislature. Some appeared to think, that the measures of the executive government ought to be received with confidence, whilst others contended that watchfulness and distrust should mark the conduct of Parliament. Without entering into such disquisitions, he felt confident that he expressed the general sentiment of the country when he said, that at no time were the wants of a fixed and settled government more urgent&#x2014;at no time were the dangers and inconveniences likely to arise from further changes more imminent.<lb/>
The state of our external relations&#x2014;the position of our domestic affairs&#x2014;the harassed state of the public mind, consequent upon the events of the last twelve months; and (if it was permitted to make such a reference) the protracted anxieties which had been endured&#x2014;the moral courage and the singleness of heart and purpose which had been manifested in the highest quarter of the realm&#x2014;all pointed to this conclusion. He had, therefore, he difficulty in saying, that having advertence to the general situation of affairs, he had, <i>&#x00E0;, priori,</i> a wish to afford his humble support to his majesty's present servants; and he had therefore only had to ask himself, whether there was any thing arising out of his unvarying connexion, political and personal, with the late Mr. Canning, which ought to lead him to withhold such support; and it was upon the maturest reflection that he had come to the decision that there was nothing,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0292"/>
<col>569</col>
either of a public or private nature connected with his late right hon. friend, which ought to lead him to resist the bias which he had described, or to do otherwise than express his cordial concurrence with those, who, under the present circumstances of the country, had not thought it their duty to relinquish the service of the king. What, he would ask, were the principal political topics of the present time? What the measures on which the friends and adherents of Mr. Canning would be justified in expressing their mistrust of the noble duke and his colleagues?<lb/>
The transactions in the East of Europe &#x2014;the affairs of Portugal&#x2014;the new States of South America&#x2014;the Corn-bill&#x2014;the Finances, and the Catholic question. These were the principal matters now pending, and on none of them, he contended, was there any just ground of mistrust of the conduct and intentions of the new ministry. He conceived the Protocol signed at St. Petersburg, and the Greek treaty of the 6th July last, had one and the same object&#x2014;the pacification of Greece. There were some shades of difference between them; the principle, however, was the same.&#x2014;The noble duke at the head of the administration had negociated and signed the former, and a few days ago distinctly intimated to their lordships his intentions of giving full execution to the latter, both in its letter and spirit.&#x2014;Where, therefore, could there be any ground of apprehension as to the conduct of the government on this important subject. The affairs of Portugal were in train of execution, and drawing to their consummation. Had the noble duke withheld from parliament his sentiments as to the system adopted towards Portugal by his right hon. friend, still there could have been no just grounds of uneasiness as to the conduct which would now be pursued. It will, however, be in the recollection of the House that, in the autumn of 1826, when our troops were embarking for the Tagus, the noble duke had in his place in that House, expressed in the most distinct and explicit manner, his approbation of that measure and of the principles on which it was founded.<lb/>
Under present circumstances, the retracing the steps taken towards the New States of South America would be impossible. The noble duke, however, had lately told the House, that the mode in which those States had been recognized was, in his opinion, most judicious; and the period
<col>570</col>
at which the recognition was made was equally well chosen.&#x2014;Having reference to the votes of the other House of parliament now upon their lordships' table, and to the appointment of a Finance Committee by that assembly, no doubt could be entertained of the intentions of government as to the institution of a full, free, and most impartial, inquiry into the state of the national finances, with a view to all practical retrenchment.&#x2014;With regard to the Corn-bill and the Catholic question, the noble duke had also spoken. With respect to the last he had intimated that in future the patronage of government should be impartially distributed, and that recantations of sentiments favourable to the Catholics would no longer be expected, as has heretofore been conceived to be the case, from those who wish to advance themselves in the two learned professions. Should this line of policy be adhered to, the friends of the Catholic question need be under no apprehension as to its ultimate result.<lb/>
He would now consider how far there was any thing connected with matters purely personal which ought to lead the friends of Mr. Canning to oppose the existing government. He would not enter into the question, whether private feelings ought to regulate public conduct; allowing, however, that the keeping alive deep-rooted and ancient animosities was a duty imperative upon friends and adherents&#x2014;admitting that inveterate and irreconcilable feuds were to be considered as a sacred inheritance&#x2014;yet still he maintained, that it was open to the friends of Mr. Canning, without impugning such anti-social doctrines, to support the present government. In truth, to this case no such doctrines applied; no such ancient and inveterate hostility existed between his right hon. friend and his majesty's present servants&#x2014;was it necessary that he should refer to the ardent zeal, to the indefatigable courage, with which his right hon. friend had both in and out of office so long co-operated with the noble duke in the great peninsular cause, where the noble duke had obtained such immortal glory?&#x2014;Need he refer to the identity of counsel which led to the signature of the Greek Protocol at St. Petersburg.&#x2014;To the many years in which they sat amicably in the same cabinet, and to the earnestness with which up to the latest period of his life, Mr. Canning had been desirous of seeing the command of the army resumed by the noble duke.<lb/>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0293"/>
<col>571</col>
Again, the right hon. gentleman, holding the seals of the Home Department, had publicly declared last year, that with the single exception of the Catholic question, there was a complete unity of opinion between himself and Mr. Canning. With respect to his noble friend below him (lord Bathurst), he was confident that he must know that, up to a late period, any thing but animosity had been felt by Mr. Canning towards him.&#x2014;He concurred in what had just fallen from his noble friend who spoke last, as to the opinion expressed the other night by one member of his majesty's government (lord Ellenborough). That noble lord had further declared, that he could not understand what the principles of Mr. Canning were; but he thought that the friends of that right hon. gentleman would not, by supporting the ministry; in any way compromise those principles, merely on the ground of the noble lord's not being able to understand them.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CATHOLIC EMANCIPATION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00366"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution>, in presenting three petitions from the county of Cavan, praying for Catholic Emancipation, took occasion to enlarge upon the folly of continuing the distinctions which arise from religious opinions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00367"><member>Sir John Brydges</member><membercontribution> condemned the practice indulged in by hon. gentlemen, of haranguing upon the subject of every petition they presented to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00368"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> said, he had seen many useful measures carried, and many injurious acts got rid of, by means of the harangues of which the hon. member complained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00369"><member>Mr. Wallace</member><membercontribution> addressed the House for the first time. He said it was desirable that the fullest information should be given on every subject connected with the distresses of Ireland, and the manifold evils which grew out of those distresses. Things could not go on in the way in which they now were in Ireland; and every occasion should be taken both "in season and out of season," of expatiating on the wrongs of that country, and the urgent necessity of redressing them. He could not, therefore, concur in the observation of the hon. baronet, that these petitions should be presented in silence.
<col>572</col>
The presentation of petitions was a proper and constitutional one for expressing the opinions of members on the subjects to which they referred. If the House was not reminded of the evils complained of, they might forget them. The mere laying of petitions on the table could answer no beneficial purpose.</membercontribution></p>

<title>STAMP DUTY ON RECEIPTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00370"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> presented a petition from Brechin, complaining of the Two-penny Stamp Duty, which brought an inconsiderable revenue, was unequal in its operation, and attended with vexatious litigation. The petitioners also complained of the legacy duty, which was attended in its operation with great inequality and hardship. When a poor person died&#x2014;a person, for instance, who might not have more than 20<i>l.</i>&#x2014;it was necessary that all the articles about him, even to the night-cap and old shoes of the deceased, should be taxed by this act, for the repeal of which, the petitioners now prayed. Again; a man who might have assets to the amount of 1,500<i>l.</i>, though he owed that sum, and even more, yet, before those assets could be touched, they were subjected to the duty of 60<i>l.</i> The petitioners also complained of a practice that prevailed in Scotland, that no person could institute a suit for the recovery of any sum above two guineas, without being subjected to a duty of 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> All these duties were levied with great hardship, and the amount which they brought in to the revenue, would be more than compensated by the reduction of one useless regiment of cavalry, or of infantry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00371"><member>Mr. Bright</member><membercontribution> concurred in opinion, that these small duties on stamps were unproductive to the revenue, and extremely vexatious on the poorer classes. He considered them more vexatious in their operation than the Salt-tax. One of the hardships was, that the Stamp-office hired informers, to discover those who infringed the Statute.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00372"><member>Mr. Sykes</member><membercontribution> said, that the law upon this subject was extremely oppressive to the population of the town which he represented. He thought it a severe hardship that the Stamp-office should advertize for informers in the manner which they notoriously did. He hoped the legislature would direct its attention to the subject, in reference to which he had some petitions to present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00373"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, that informers were
<image src="S2V0018P0I0294"/>
<col>573</col>
the only means which the legislature had of enforcing the observance of the laws which it enacted. But for these informers the law would be evaded, and their services were required in order to prevent the more harsh and oppressive course of intruding on private families. However severely the penalties might sometimes be felt, those penalties protected the honest trader from the one who violated the law.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH SUB-LETTING ACT.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00375"><member>Mr. Villiers Stuart</member><membercontribution> presented a petition from Waterford against the Sub-letting Act. He thought it might be amended although it was grounded on a right principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00376"><member>Mr. Brownlow</member><membercontribution> panegyrized the Landlord and Tenant bill, which, he contended, was calculated to produce great benefit to Ireland. One great benefit which would arise from it was, that it would prevent that under-letting of small portions of land, which had been found so injurious.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00377"><member>Sir H. Parnell</member><membercontribution> also defended the Landlord and Tenant bill, and was ready to avow the share he had taken in its formation. He hoped the House would at length take the real state of Ireland into its consideration, and by getting rid of nostrums, adopt some sound principle of internal management, by which the industry of the country would be fairly stimulated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00378"><member>Mr. J. Grattan</member><membercontribution> was not opposed to the principle of the Landlord and Tenant bill, but he thought time ought to be given to the people of Ireland to become acquainted with the nature of its operation. With respect to emigration, he for one should oppose himself to the raising of a loan of a million, as had been recommended, for the purpose of sending eighty thousand of the Irish people to Canada. Remedies of a different nature ought to be provided for the evils existing in that unhappy country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00379"><member>Mr. G. Moore</member><membercontribution> thought it would be too much to say that the misery to which Ireland was reduced by the existence of her large unemployed population, was to be traced to this act. The House ought to take into their consideration the best means of redressing the evils under which that population suffered for want of employment: and they would then be conferring a real benefit on Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00380"><member>General Hart</member><membercontribution> thought that the super-
<col>574</col>
abundant population of Ireland without employment was the great evil of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00381"><member>Mr. Wallace</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that several provisions of the act were very objectionable. It seemed to him that it must have been passed without the legislature having given due consideration to the state of that country. He would not set up the opinion of any man, however well informed, against a proof of practical inconvenience; and it seemed to him that the practical inconveniences resulting from this act were numerous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00382"><member>Mr. L. Foster</member><membercontribution> said, he differed from the learned gentleman respecting the inconveniences to be suffered from this act, and must put a different construction upon its clauses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00383"><member>Mr. W. Lamb</member><membercontribution> said, there never was an act for which there had been so unanimous and long-continued a call as for some measure of this nature. Let hon. gentlemen read all the volumes written on the condition of Ireland, statistical and political; let them read all the various, able, and elaborate, speeches delivered on the condition of that country; let them read all the ample minutes of inquiry made before committees of both Houses, and they would find that the attention of parliament had been most peculiarly directed to the consideration of this practice of sub-letting, and of minutely sub-dividing, land. There could be no doubt it had originated chiefly in the circumstances of the country; and its abuses had been greatly aggravated, by the causes which had been adverted to. Nor could it be doubted that it was one of the great sources of the miseries of the unemployed population of that country. Still, it must be admitted, that great and sudden changes could not be safely made in matters deeply affecting the mass of the people. It was impossible to bring them over suddenly to changes in their laws, however pernicious in their principle or results. Any attempt to interfere with those feelings and habits, would necessarily be attended with considerable murmuring and discontent. He should be most happy in taking an opportunity of fully considering the subject. If it was possible to make any modification of the provisions of this act perfectly consistent with its main principle and object, it would be the duty of parliament to do so.</membercontribution></p>

<col>575</col>
<title>LUNATIC ASYLUMS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00385"><member>Mr. Robert Gordon</member><membercontribution> rose, in pursuance of the instructions of the Committee, to move for leave to bring in a Bill to Amend the Law for the Regulation of Lunatic Asylums. At the latter end of the last session, he had obtained a committee to inquire into the state of the Lunatic Asylums in the neighbourhood of the metropolis. That committee had been attended very diligently by the members, and the result of the evidence was such as fully justified him in every assertion he had made in moving for it. He would venture to repeat what he had before said on this subject; namely, that in the present state of the law, an individual possessing a great income might, with much more ease than the House could suppose, be imprisoned on the false pretence of insanity, at the instance of some person acting from malicious or interested motives. Whoever had read the report of the committee would see it perfectly established in evidence, that there was a great deal too much facility in granting certificates to the keepers of Lunatic Asylums. The only provision of the law against the false imprisonment of any individual, under the plea of insanity, was, that the keeper of a lunatic hospital could not receive any person as a lunatic into his establishment, without an accompanying certificate, signed by a physician, surgeon, or apothecary; and he begged the House to observe, that the term apothecary was, in this act, interpreted to mean merely a seller of drugs; so that any dealer in drugs had the right of signing a certificate, consigning any person to imprisonment whom he deemed to be insane. Nay, the very apprentice of this man, as soon as his indentures had expired, might, by his signature to a certificate, consign any person, under the pretence of insanity, to all the miseries of the mad-house. This certificate was granted previously to the person being received into this shocking receptacle of deranged humanity; so that it might sometimes happen, that this ignorant practitioner would see a person labouring under the delirium of a fever, or the hallucination occasioned by opium, and grant a certificate under which the unfortunate sufferer might, for months afterwards, remain immured amidst the horrors of a mad-house. There could be no doubt that it was the business of the legislature to prevent, as far as possible,
<col>576</col>
any risk of persons being improperly confined, and all the witnesses had agreed, that some new enactment was necessary to regulate the mode of granting certificates.<lb/>
He next begged to call the attention of the House to the manner in which those who were the proper objects of this system of coercion were treated in Lunatic Asylums, with the view to their recovery. He would state a case. He would suppose that of any individual belonging to some parish about twenty miles from the metropolis; so that the distance would necessarily render very rare the visits of the clergyman and of his own friends or relatives. He would place him at the White House in Bethnal-Green. He took that house, because it was kept by Mr. Warburton, who had under his care half the lunatic paupers within the bills of mortality, including those of the parishes of St. Mary-la-bonne and St. George, Hanover-square, of which latter he (Mr. Gordon) was a vestryman. He would place this supposed lunatic, then, in Mr. Warburton's establishment at Bethnal-Green. What probability, he would ask, was there that his malady would be removed by the curative process followed in that place? He would appeal to the returns to the inquiries made by lord Robert Seymour, from the clergymen of the different parishes in the county of Middlesex. He would appeal to the evidence of the committee, to prove that no attempt was made of any curative process for the mental malady. He would then ask, what chance there was of improving the bodily health of the patient? From the defective skill of the medical attendants, it was evident that no care was taken, of his bodily health. The House would be surprised to learn, that in a hospital comprising four hundred patients, they only received the attendance of one medical person. This was a Mr. Dunstan, who, however, attended but every other day, for an hour or two at a time. He was also the surgeon of St. Luke's hospital, and he attended all Mr. Warburton's other establishments, besides having a fair share of private practice. This was the scale of medical attendance on the wretched sufferers; one surgeon for an hour or two every other day, to take charge of the health of four hundred patients. As a proof how little attention was paid to their medical treatment, he held in his hand one of those slips of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0296"/>
<col>577</col>
paper which every member of the committee would so readily recollect. It appeared; from this paper, that out of these four; hundred persons, in May last, eight only were under the treatment of medicine. It was clearly established by the evidence of those who were most acquainted with the subject, that they considered insanity as a disorder which might be removed by medical treatment, or moral care.<lb/>
But, if this was the case of the unfortunate patient as to his mind and body, what was his condition as to general accommodation? In this house of Mr. Warburton, there was no attempt at classification. Suppose the patient whose case he had imagined was one of that class who were passed into the crib-room, what was his situation? He was placed in a box six feet long, covered with straw, and Chained down both by the arms and the legs. In this state he was left the whole night through, without attendance or assistance, or the possibility of either. One of the witnesses had been very indignant, because it had been stated, in one of the reports, that sixteen of these unfortunate persons had been confined all night in one of these wretched rooms. What really was the fact? It turned out that the number was not sixteen, but fifteen; and these fifteen were confined in a room twenty-six feet long. In these cribs they lay insensible to the calls of nature, and were left to wallow all night in their own filth &#x0021;&#x2014;In Bethlem and St. Luke's Hospitals the lunatics in good health were kept in separate cells. But if these unhappy patients of Mr. Warburton suffered thus during the week, what was their condition on Sunday? "E'en Sunday shone no Sabbath day to them &#x0021;" They were confined in this horrible place from Saturday night until Monday morning: fifteen human beings lay wallowing in their filth &#x0021; throughout the whole of Sunday &#x0021; It was attempted by Mr. Warburton and his witnesses to contradict this statement, which was originally made by a patient who had recovered, and gave evidence before the committee. Mr. Warburton complained of the introduction of evidence of this kind, and begged that he might himself be examined, and his assistants also. They were all examined as he desired; but what was the result? Every word of the charge was fully confirmed from the mouths of his own witnesses. At the end of the inquiry into this part of the subject,
<col>578</col>
no doubt existed on the mind of the committee, that it had been the custom of Mr. Warburton's house to confine these lunatics throughout every Sunday. There was evidence also given, descriptive of the mode in which they were treated on the Monday morning. In a state of nudity, covered with sores and ordure, they were carried into the yard, and plunged suddenly into cold water, even when ice was swimming on the pails. In this situation, with little attention bestowed on him, and no benefit from medicine, the individual, whose case he had supposed, was on the point of falling under the evils-that pressed upon him. At last his health failed. He was then removed to the infirmary.&#x2014;It was impossible with the strongest language to describe the horrors of this place. Could the right hon. the Secretary of State for the Home Department believe, that this infirmary in Mr. Warburton's house was a room not known to exist by the medical attendants sent into it by several families who had patients there? When it was found out&#x2014;what was the condition in which it was discovered to be? He would read the description in the language of the witnesses. The hon. gentleman then read a passage stating, "that the air of the infirmary was so highly oppressive that the witnesses could not breathe." It also represented as disgusting in the highest degree, the horrible exhalations of excrementitious matter arising from the patients. Mr. Warburton had attempted to deny these facts also; but they were incontestably established. He felt it his duty to state, that it appeared by the minutes of the evidence of the physicians and others before the committee, that however bad Warburton's house might be, it was good, as compared with others of the same kind, if not much better than many of them. It might at least be taken as a fair sample of what these houses were. Mr. Warburton had been permitted to read all the evidence against him, and to bring forward his own witnesses to rebut it. The report had made no statement respecting him which was not confirmed by his own witnesses. Mr. Dunstan, his medical attendant, visited the patients every other day. Mr. Warburton himself came only twice a week, for about an hour, or an hour and a half each time. He had so many establishments, that though he stated in his evidence, that he thought he knew the mode of curing madness better.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0297"/>
<col>579</col>
than any other individual, he acknowledged that his time was so occupied, that it would not permit him to investigate the cases of the persons placed under his care. As a sample of Mr. Warburton's witnesses, he would take Mr. Cordell, who used to act as the occasional assistant of Mr. Dunstan. This person was asked by a member of the committee, whether he only went occasionally? He stated, that he did not attend regularly. He was next asked, whether any register was kept of the state of the patients? He replied, "Yes, we have the most perfect register you can conceive; it is an account of the treatment and condition of every patient, moral and medical; it is for accuracy and neatness, a perfect pattern. We can trace the illness of every patient for six or seven years, and we can find a statement of every prescription written for him, and every circumstance attending the progress of his malady." Would the House believe, that there was not a word of truth in this statement? Could they believe that it was wholly false? Yet so it was. The next day the committee sent for Mr. Dunstan, and requested him to bring this book. He replied, there was no such thing in existence. Mr. Dunstan was required to attend in person. Cordell's evidence was read over to him. He said there was no such register as Cordell had described; that the whole statement was perfectly inaccurate. The committee then sent for Cordell, and read over to him what had taken place. He was afterwards asked, whether the committee were to understand that his statement was altogether incorrect? His reply was, "It is very probable." He was then pressed to say, whether the committee should believe the evidence he had given that day, or on the Saturday before? Cordell coolly replied, "All I told you the other day was inaccurate: it was false from beginning to end." He added, that the story of the great book was all his own invention. The committee, finding themselves placed in rather an awkward situation by this conduct, intended at first to have submitted the case to the House, and called upon it to interfere and visit its wrath on the offending party. But as there remained only a few days of the session, they borrowed a little of the Speaker's authority, and, after keeping Cordell in duress for two or three days, they severely reprimanded and discharged him. The
<col>580</col>
circumstances did not appear on the minutes of the committee; and he had mentioned it, as he was otherwise afraid that Cordell's character would not be known as it deserved to be. They had not harassed Mr. Dunstan or his assistant, Cordell, much with questions, as it was evidently useless.&#x2014;He could not refrain from quoting one other sample of the conduct of Mr. Warburton's establishment. In September last, an inquest was held on the body of a patient who had died there. Through my hon. friend, Mr. Spring Rice, then Under Secretary of State, he obtained a copy of the coroner's report. In the inquiry before the committee, it appeared beyond all doubt, there were no sick stores in the infirmary, and no medical attendance except that of Dunstan every other day; and when he could not attend, that of a young man, about twenty years of age, the celebrated Mr. Cordell. In his evidence, Mr. Warburton asserted roundly, that every possible attention was shown to the patients, to whom he said sago, arrow-root, wine, and light puddings, were administered as they needed them. The committee asked the superintendant of this establishment, if he had any bills for the sago and other articles provided for the sick? He stated in reply, that he had no bill, as he had always paid ready money for every thing he bought, and that the course was to enter all he laid out in one sum as sundries. His (Mr. Gordon's) impression of this evidence was, that it was false, the whole of it. At least it could not be true to the extent stated by the witness. It was impossible to believe that Mr. Warburton would allow any manager, in so large an establishment, to lay out what he pleased, and keep no books.<lb/>
The hon. gentleman then adverted to some considerations with which he had opened his speech. He had pointed out the great difficulty and danger of the existing law; first, as to the certificate of insanity; secondly, as to the treatment of the lunatic in confinement, supposing him to be properly confined; and thirdly, if, through the interposition of Divine Providence, he should regain his senses, the much greater difficulty he would experience in regaining his freedom, and returning again into society. He knew of no process that could be effectual for this purpose, if it was the interest of the keeper, or any body else acting with him, to continue the im-

<col>581</col>
prisonment. He, perhaps, should be told, that the party aggrieved might apply for a writ of <i>habeas corpus.</i> Laying aside the cost of this proceeding, how could the individual in confinement make his complaint in the first instance, if he was treated as a lunatic? The law at present directed, that five physicians should visit these houses and keep a register of their proceedings. He would narrate one instance, to show how this duty of supervision was performed, which had reached him through his hon. friend, the member for Portsmouth (Mr. F. Baring). A married lady, named Pettingall was, in May, 1825, confined as a lunatic, but she did not appear to the Committee of Magistrates to be then labouring under insanity; and it also appeared, that she had not exhibited any marks of insanity for twelve months. Under these circumstances, they directed a communication to be made to her husband. About the same time in 1827, she was still reported to be conducting herself with propriety, but the husband had taken no notice of the application for her release. When the committee met, they learned, on inquiry, from the medical attendant, Dr. Bright, that the husband had refused to liberate her, because he said she was a troublesome woman, and not fit to be at large&#x2014;" There," he added, "she shall remain." When he (Mr. Gordon) came to town at the end of November, he sent for Dr. Bright, to ascertain whether Mrs. Pettingall was still in confinement. He found that the doctor had remonstrated in vain with her husband. As he considered the lady perfectly sane, he gave notice, that if she was not immediately liberated, he would move for a writ of Habeas Corpus at his own expense; and it was not till five days before the meeting of parliament, that she was finally released.<lb/>
He then reverted to the state of the existing law. By the 14th of George 3rd, c. 49, a license to keep a house for the reception of lunatics could only be granted by five commissioners, to be appointed for that purpose by the College of Physicians. These commissioners were bound to visit each of these houses once a year, and if they found any thing improper, they were directed to place a card in the censors' room, stating what they had discovered to be incorrect. Unfortunately, this provision had never been attended to in practice; at least since 1800. The excuse for this negligence was, that the complaint
<col>582</col>
to the censors did no good, and was therefore as well abandoned. The only regulation of the law, for the protection of these unfortunate beings, was thus violated. When he first entered on this subject, he had naturally asked, as the commissioners had omitted the duty prescribed by law, what else they had substituted? If they had not acted according to the letter of the law, he hoped they had done nothing against its spirit. But he found, on further inquiry, that they had done nothing&#x2014;literally and strictly nothing. Sure he was that, if any thing was communicated to the right hon. gentleman opposite, representing that great abuses existed in some department of the state, and that the law was not sufficient to suppress them&#x2014; if any such communication was made to him or to any other member of parliament, they would feel it their duty to take some steps to amend this defect in the law, and especially if they had found abuses of the gross and disgusting nature he had laid open that evening.<lb/>
The hon. gentleman then referred to the minutes of the physicians, as to some of these houses. Holt's house was represented as very disorderly and dirty. In another, twenty patients were together in one small room, the air of which was close and offensive. In another, two patients were found lying in an outhouse, and three others chained down by the arms, wrists, and legs. Their wrists were blistered, and their persons covered only by rags. One female was the only servant they had to attend to them. Was this a system to be tolerated? He was not speaking of the practice in a distant part of the country, but actually within five miles of London. Had he not, then, made out a sufficient case to justify him in asking for an alteration of the law? He begged the House to consent to it for the sake of the wretched beings, whose serious afflictions had fallen on them by the visitation of Providence, and who were suffering daily and hourly torments which no tongue could describe. If there were any who considered this a pseudo-philanthropy, he would reply, that it was a pursuit as worthy and as much called-for as the exertions that had been made for many-years to improve the state of the gaols. No class of sufferers could have stronger claims on our sympathy and kindness than, that which he had brought under the attention, of the House. He would not feel
<image src="S2V0018P0I0299"/>
<col>583</col>
desirous that the bill should be brought in, if it had not been carefully and duly considered. It had been shewn, within the last six months, to two Secretaries of State, and four Under Secretaries, previous to the return of the right hon. gentleman to office; and they had all viewed it with approbation. Within the last two days, he had placed it in the hands of the highest law authority in the kingdom, who had promised to give his assistance in removing all obstacles to its success. He earnestly trusted that parliament would not relax its efforts on a subject, so interesting to humanity. He knew, that to endeavour to correct abuses or redress grievances, was no very agreeable or easy task; as those who undertook it found so many private interests and personal feelings arranged against them. Many of the abuses which he had described as belonging to Mr. Warburton's house, were three months before the committee had been appointed; and he believed that many of them had since been remedied. The public attention had been excited, and the public asylums for the reception of pauper lunatics had been much ameliorated. He could not sit down without alluding to the splendid liberality of a gentleman, Mr. F. J. Browne, who for a quarter of a century had represented the county of Dorset in that House; that gentleman had given a manor-house to the county for the reception of lunatics, and had sunk a sum of money in the funds for the purpose of providing it an annual income for its support. He thanked the House, in behalf of himself and of those whose cause he was advocating, for the attention it had paid to him; and he trusted that the time was fast approaching, when England would emulate the example of the continent on this subject. In Holland, in France, in Italy, and even in Spain (meanly as we thought of that country), there were establishments existing for the reception of lunatics, which, to those of this country who had visited them, had been the subject of their envy and admiration. The hon. member concluded by moving for leave to bring in a bill "to consolidate and amend the several acts, respecting County Lunatic Asylums, to facilitate the erection of County Lunatic Asylums, and to improve the treatment of Pauper and Criminal Lunatics."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00386"><member>Lord Ashley</member><membercontribution> seconded the motion; but his lordship spoke in so low a tone, that he was nearly inaudible in the gallery.
<col>584</col>
He alluded to the evidence given before the committee, to prove that it was highly necessary that something should be done relative to the treatment of Pauper Lunatics; and he cited several cases that had come within his own knowledge, which clearly proved that the present system was greatly defective.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00387"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that he did not think that the hon. gentleman had done justice to the feelings of the House, when he had supposed that his motion would be treated with the slightest inattention; for he was sure that it must not only be impressed with the importance of the question, but also feel grateful to the hon. gentleman for having taken it up; especially as he must have devoted his time to it from a feeling of pure philanthropy; and he thought that a more important subject could not have been chosen, though it was not one calculated for display. During the summer, he had paid some attention to the report that had been made by the committee; and though he had not himself taken any part in the present bill, he trusted that the hon. gentleman would introduce it on such a principle that it would execute itself; for, unless that should be the case, there would be danger that, in the course of fifteen or twenty years, when the public attention was no longer excited, the same abuses as those now complained of would creep in. There could not be a question, that unless the asylums for pauper lunatics were well conducted, they would be a curse rather than a blessing; and that it would be infinitely better to have none at all, than such as would only offer temptations to send unfortunate creatures to them. There were cases in which the patient was merely somewhat troublesome, and it was much better that such as these should be abroad; it being preferable to leave them in the custody of their relations, than to lock them up in mad-houses. That mildness of treatment might produce the best effects was to be seen from the manner in which the house in St. George's fields was conducted. Patients had been removed thither, after being chained to the wall for nine years at the other place, and brought to quiet and tranquillity by the pursuing of a milder course. Unless, therefore, these asylums were well regulated, they were the greatest curses that could exist. But he wished to suggest to the hon. gentleman, that there might be danger in the

<col>585</col>
establishment of a permanent Board of Commissioners. It was human nature, that daily and weekly visits to such scenes should harden men's hearts; and he thefore thought that it would be infinitely better, instead of a permanent board being established, that every six months new physicians and new visitors should be appointed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00388"><member>Mr. R. Gordon</member><membercontribution> said, he proposed that they should be appointed annually.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00389"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> was afraid that the old members would be sure to be re-appointed, unless it was positively enacted that new physicians and visitors should be appointed twice a year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00390"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> said, that when he was younger he had paid much attention to this subject, and had visited all the madhouses round London, by which he had been eye-witness of the great abuses practised. He was therefore rejoiced at the prospect of alteration. He trusted that no house, however respectable, would be exempted from the operation of the bill; and that those which stood highest in reputation, would forego any privilege, in order that the act might be completely carried into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00391"><member>Mr. R. Gordon</member><membercontribution> said, it was the object of his bill to place the matter entirely under the direction of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00393"><member>Mr. Portman</member><membercontribution> rose to inquire, whether it was the intention of the Treasury to take any steps I for inquiring into the complaints of the Maltsters?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00394"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that his right hon. friend, the chancellor of the Exchequer, would be better able to speak upon the subject than he was; but he knew that his right hon. friend meant to lose no time in entering into personal communication with the parties, upon the matters in which they thought themselves aggrieved.&#x2014;While he was upon his legs he might as well take the opportunity of removing one or two erroneous impressions which had gone abroad, as to part of the statement which he had made on a former evening. He was aware that in doing this he was a little out of order; but where the personal feelings of a member were concerned, it was the cus-
<col>586</col>
tom of the House to extend some indulgence. He had stated, on a former evening, that he had heard on that evening, for the first time, and with great surprise, the fact, that the resignation of his right hon. friend, the Secretary for the Colonies, had been made known to the noble lord at the head of the late government on the 29th of December. That this, and nothing else, had been his statement he was convinced, both from his own recollection and from, his knowledge of what was the real fact; and, as a further confirmation, he might be excused for observing, that he found his meaning distinctly so expressed in two publications which were known to attend very ably and correctly to the matters that passed in that House. He would repeat, that his observation on the preceding evening had been confined most strictly withinthislimit,&#x2014;thathe,onthatnight,had heard for the first time, that the Secretary of the Colonies had tendered his resignation to the noble lord at the head of the government on the 29th of December; not that he then learned for the first time (which undoubtedly he could not do) the fact, that that resignation had been tendered at all. In the two interviews previous to that date, he might say safely, that he had been ignorant as to what an extent the perseverance of the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies, upon the point in difference between them, had been carried. Had he been aware of that fact, it was possible&#x2014;he did not say that the thing would have been so, but it was possible&#x2014; he might have been induced to give it further consideration. His statement to the House, on a former evening, had been I such as he now declared, and no other; and both "The Times" and the "Morning Chronicle" had given distinctly the fact, that he had complained, that the resignation of his right hon. friend, on the 29th of December, had not been communicated to him; that he had not been informed of it until the 5th of January. It had been supposed and said that, in what he had stated, lie meant to convey a denial of the truth of the account of the noble lord at the head of the late government, as to the causes by which that government had been dissolved. When any man of character&#x2014; far less such an individual as the noble lord alluded to&#x2014;spoke of motives, he could have no hesitation in saying, that such a declaration was unanswerable&#x2014;that of his own motives he must be incomparably the

<col>587</col>
best judge; but, at the same time, nothing could alter his (Mr. Herries) personal conviction, founded upon all that he knew of the facts, that the trifling circumstance of the difference between his right hon. friend, the Secretary for the Colonies, and himself&#x2014;trifling, as compared with other matters, and, he repeated, most trifling, because he had been ready to settle it in the most, amicable way, by his own resignation&#x2014;by the sacrifice, if there was to be any sacrifice, of himself,&#x2014;that a difference so easily disposed of never could be, and never had been, the true and operative cause of the dissolution of the late government. Other causes, and far more important ones, had been pressing&#x2014;that was the truth&#x2014;with an embarrassing weight upon the administration; and he did believe, that no arguments would ever convince impartial persons, who took the trouble to advert to all the facts, that so trifling a circumstance as was alleged, had been the cause of so important a catastrophe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00395"><member>Mr. T. Duncombe</member><membercontribution> said, that his only excuse for intruding upon the House was, the speech which had just been made by the right hon. gentleman; and he confessed, so far from taking it as an explanation, that he had never heard any address from an hon. member that surprised him more. If his senses, on a preceding evening, had not entirely failed him, he had heard the right hon. gentleman say, that it was then, for the first time, that he had heard of the resignation of the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies. Nay, the right hon. gentleman had repeated the expression: he had used it twice. This was not only his impression, but that of several other members around him; and he was astonished to find the right hon. gentleman, three days afterwards, giving the statement a totally different construction. He expected, after this, that the right hon. gentleman would next explain away the well-remembered words which he had uttered&#x2014;" I know it." One expression was just as clear as the other. With respect to the whole statement, indeed, of the right hon. gentleman, he came to the same conclusion. He believed that the right hon. gentleman's object was to mystify the late transactions, so that they should be beyond all mortal understanding; and, if such was his intent, he had completely succeeded. If any thing like explanation was meant by the right hon. gentleman's speeches, he protested that he considered them as a most exemplary failure.</membercontribution></p>
<col>588</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00396"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that perhaps the House would allow him to re-state a fact, which he apprehended the hon. member had not distinctly heard. He had stated, on a preceding evening, not that which the hon. member imputed to him, but that he had heard, on that night, for the first time, that the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies had resigned on the 29th of December: and he had added a complaint, that he had not been informed of that fact, until the 5th of January. Two morning papers, which had reported his speech upon that evening, distinctly confirmed his present representation of that which he had said. He desired to repeat that representation; and if the hon. member still doubted its accuracy, he might refer to the reports which he had alluded to; but which it was not possible for him, in his own justification, to produce.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00397"><member>Lord Milton</member><membercontribution> thought that the House was bound to take the fact to be as the right hon. gentleman had stated it. There could be no doubt but that he must be best able to decide that which he himself had said, independent of the authority alluded to. But he would put that question entirely aside; for that which the right hon. gentleman had just stated to the House seemed to him to be full of most important matter. The right hon. gentleman, on a preceding evening, had imputed a design&#x2014;an intention&#x2014;he did not know whether the right hon. gentleman had used the word" plot," but certainly he said a design, and an intention&#x2014;to break up the ministry, and that his own threatened resignation had only been made a pretence for dissolving it. The right hon. gentleman had added, "I know it." Now, he would not have referred to that declaration, if the right hon. gentleman had not expressly, on the present evening, repeated to the House, by implication, that he was cognizant of that fact. If the right hon. gentleman was so&#x2014;if he knew that a design had existed, and knew the parties who were concerned in it,&#x2014;he had that to state as to which all the explanations hitherto given to the House were not worth common attention &#x2014;were but as dust in the balance. All that had been stated was nothing&#x2014;it was valueless and inefficient&#x2014;as compared with the knowledge which the hon. gentleman, told the House he had behind. If he did know of this design, he must know the grounds of it, the objects of it, and the parties concerned in it; and on these heads
<image src="S2V0018P0I0302"/>
<col>589</col>
it was the bounden duty of the right hon. gentleman&#x2014;a duty from which he could not retreat&#x2014;to give the House an explanation [loud cheers.]</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00398"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, he had no doubt that the right hon. gentleman was prepared to answer the inquiries of his noble friend. Indeed, it was impossible that he should avoid doing so. But he wished to put one other question to the right hon. gentleman, without which his answer would neither be complete nor satisfactory to the House. If the right hon. gentleman had not, on a preceding evening, come forward with a gratuitous explanation of the charges which he thought affected his character as a public man and as a minister, he should have had no title to ask the right hon. gentleman the question which he was about to put. But, as he had come forward, uncalled upon, to reply to a charge not suggested in the House&#x2014;a charge that he had gone and consulted with some one out of the cabinet, and out of the circle of the administration&#x2014;as he had denied that charge, with an explicitness which had scarcely, even in the walls of that House, been exceeded,&#x2014;that being the case, he wished to know of the right hon. gentleman, whether he rightly understood him to have said, "as he hoped to be saved," and "upon his sacred honour as a gentleman," there was no foundation whatever for the charges and insinuations which had been brought against him elsewhere, that he had gone forth from the cabinet, in the course of the struggles of the ministry, and made a communication in a certain other quarter&#x2014;the highest quarter in the state: assuming the right hon. gentleman to have said this, since it was not contradicted,&#x2014;that he most solemnly denied having consulted any party out of the circle of the cabinet on the imputed occasion&#x2014;did the right hon. gentleman mean also to say, that no party out of the cabinet had ever consulted him? He wished to know, whether the right hon. gentleman's denial went to the fact of any individual having consulted with him, as well as of his having consulted with any individual?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00399"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that he did not think the hon. and learned gentleman had a right to put that last question. He doubted whether it ought to be asked: at least, he thought it would more properly have been omitted. All he would say was this, that he entirely abided by his explanations already given. He would enter
<col>590</col>
into no more. On any subject relating to the dissolution of the late government, he should decline to go further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00400"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> observed, that he had claimed no right to ask any question. He had put his inquiry, he thought, in a way calculated to disarm all personal feeling. He had distinctly said, that he should not have thought of putting any question, except for the explanation which the right hon. gentleman had volunteered. If the right hon. gentleman intended to abide in silence now, it would have been infinitely better, for his own sake, if he had never explained at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00401"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, that if he had been silent upon a former night, it had only been because he felt that he could add nothing to that which had been stated by others. He had personally been a stranger to the cause which led to the dissolution of the late administration until the 9th of January: but, after all that had passed, he must say, that he thought further explanation from the right hon. gentleman necessary. With respect to the allegation made by the right hon. gentleman, he knew not upon what ground it rested; and until he had further proofs of the existence of a design to break up the government, he must say, with all deference to the right hon. gentleman, that he could not give credit to it. From that which he knew of those with whom he had been united in office, and from his personal knowledge of the noble lord at the head of the late government, he did most entirely believe, that if there were grounds for the insinuations of the right hon. gentleman, as to intention or design&#x2014;of those intentions or designs, the noble lord and his colleagues in the ministry, from beginning to end, had been entirely ignorant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00402"><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member><membercontribution> said, he entirely concurred in what had fallen from his right hon. friend. The circumstances which he had stated were those which, as far as his own knowledge extended, had led to the dissolution of the late administration. Nothing, indeed, could have come more unexpectedly upon him than the dissolution of the administration. Nothing could have more excited his astonishment, except, indeed, the explanation given on a former night by the right hon. gentleman. The animadversions made by the right hon. gentleman on the noble lord at the head of the late administration, coming from the quarter which they did, had in-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0303"/>
<col>591</col>
deed surprised him. When the struggles between the right hon. gentleman and other members of the cabinet were taking place, and which led, as far as he knew, to the breaking up of the late government, he was in the country, and took no part in them. The first information, indeed, which he had received of them, and of the dissolution of the government, was through the public papers. When he had heard of its dissolution, nothing had given him greater astonishment; except, indeed, the speech in explanation, which the right hon. gentleman had made on a former night.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00403"><member>Sir J. Yorke</member><membercontribution> said, that having read the explanations of a former night, and listened to those given on the present, the members of the late administration did appear to him to have been the greatest set of children that ever matters of importance were intrusted to. If that was the way in which the government of the country could be conducted, he fully agreed with the hon. member for Aberdeen, that it would be an excellent plan to have no government at all. It would be a great saving in salaries and emoluments; and the nation would get on as well by itself as with such a cabinet as the House had heard the history of. Here was a government broken up, and half the members connected with it not acquainted with the fact, until the dissolution was resolved on, and even concluded; and the king sending for the noble duke who was to form a pew one, and plainly telling him&#x2014;" You must form a new ministry, for these fellows have at last done their own business; but if they could have kept from cutting their own throats, I assure you I would have Stood by them." He was very sorry to hear so lame an explanation from the right hon. Master of the Mint. It was very poor, poor indeed&#x2014;very round-about, and full of reference to dates and hours, all which seemed to reasonable people very unimportant. He thought that, after what had fallen two evenings since from a noble lord in another place, the right hon. gentleman would have made a better statement to the House. As the account stood, it did appear that the right hon. gentleman had been the means of breaking up the last government, by his jealousy and squabbles; and if that was his general character, the sooner the duke of Wellington turned him out of the present cabinet the better.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00404"><member>Sir J. Macdonald</member><membercontribution> said, he was much
<col>592</col>
surprised that the right hon. gentleman did not mean to afford the House any further explanation. If the question at stake was a merely personal one, he should not be disposed to prolong it: but it was neither just towards individuals, nor decent towards the public, that such charges as the right hon. gentleman had made should remain without either being answered or supported. The charge of the right hon. gentleman was brought, if not against all, against a large proportion of his late colleagues. Was it against those who had quitted office, or against those who still continued in it? As well as he could understand the last comment of the right hon. gentleman, upon the declaration of lord Goderich, he seemed to acquit that noble lord of any share in the design which he had alluded to. In that case, did it not appear that the parties conceiving it must have been those even with whom the right hon. gentleman was now sitting? If this was not the case, the right hon. gentleman's insinuations must implicate somebody&#x2014;they must stick some where&#x2014;they must apply to those individuals who had been in office under the late government and had not joined the present; and for them, and on their account, he now threw back the charge into the teeth of the right hon. gentleman, who could not, he thought, under all the circumstances, avoid either abandoning it or making it good. If the right hon. gentleman ever expected to receive support, as a minister, from the House or from the country, he could not shrink from further explanation, after having gone the length that he had done. If he meant to remain a member of any government, no matter whether as chancellor of the Exchequer, or degraded to some inferior office, there was no place so low that he would be fit to fill it, or to be tolerated in it by the country, if he could bring accusations of so deep a dye against the individuals as he had done, and refuse either fully to establish or retract them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00405"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that after the observations of the hon. baronet, he would offer a few words to the House; but not at all in departure from his already expressed determination&#x2014;that of entering into no disclosures not absolutely necessary to his own exculpation. An hon. and learned gentleman, who had termed his explanation on a former evening voluntary and gratuitous, knew well that he had been
<image src="S2V0018P0I0304"/>
<col>593</col>
personally called upon for explanation, and that he would have been exclaimed against for ever if he had withheld it. He had explained, so far as was necessary, to clear his own character from misrepresentation; and he was bound to go no further. In the course of his vindication, he had asserted, and he did again assert, that it was not correct to say, that his resignation of office had been the cause of the dissolution of the late government. He had maintained, that there were other causes, and he should always maintain it; for he knew that the fact was so. He said that he "knew"&#x2014;that was, as far as a man could know, from inference and conclusion; and from that most palpable proof, that a cause so unimportant, unassisted by others, never could have produced such a result. A right hon. gentleman had said, that he did not give credit to this statement. The right hon. gentleman meant, he apprehended, to say that he (Mr. Wynn) was not aware of any other causes than that suggested. To this he would answer, that if the right hon. member did not know of any such causes, he (Mr. Herries) did. There was not, he thought, a man, in or out of that House, connected with government or not&#x2014;in short, he believed there was not a man in the kingdom, who could come to any other conclusion than that to which he had himself come, respecting the dissolution of government, or at least thus far&#x2014;that he had not been the cause of that dissolution. He repeated, that no man who was aware of the events which were passing at that time could fail to draw any other conclusion than that which he had done; though, perhaps, he knew more on the subject than others. He would repeat, that no person who saw the transactions which were then going on, could fail to come to any conclusion but this&#x2014;that there were other causes than his tender of his resignation, which operated in effecting the dissolution of the government. But he must beg the House to bear in mind, that there were others who had undertaken, and who were more competent than he was, to give an account of the cause of the fall of the late ministry, and who had referred to events connected with that event. Some of those to whom he alluded, who had referred to his resignation as the immediate cause of the dissolution, admitted that there were other circumstances which also contributed to it. Why not describe those circum-
<col>594</col>
stances? There was the point at which such description might have been given: Why was it omitted? It was not he who had undertaken to account for the dissolution of the ministry. Why had not those who had undertaken that task given an account of all the causes which led to it? If there were other events in operation which could render so trifling a circumstance as his resignation an immediate cause of the breaking up of the ministry&#x2014;if it were in such a situation before that, as to be operated upon by so slight a cause, why had it not been thought necessary by others to state all the operating causes that led to that catastrophe? He now begged to call on the right hon. gentleman, and to ask him, whether he was not aware that abundant causes existed at the time, which were likely to contribute to such a result? For his own part, he would now repeat, what he had so often said, and would always continue to say, that his resignation was not the substantive cause of the dissolution of the late government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00406"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> begged to repeat in the most distinct and unequivocal terms, his belief that the resignation of the right hon. gentleman was the cause of the dissolution of the late ministry. He knew of no other cause whatever. Whether the government could continue to stand, would have depended on the share of the confidence of parliament which it might possess; but that it was intended to meet parliament and to stand the contest on that occasion, he was convinced. Now, he begged to ask the right hon. gentleman whether, eight and forty hours before he had sent in his resignation, he had not in the cabinet, promised to co-operate in the support of lord Goderich's government to the utmost of his power? He asked him whether he had said or intimated any thing on that occasion, which could give the slightest reason to suppose that he had at that time any intention to resign? He begged to ask the right hon. gentleman whether at that time he had any intention of writing the letter tendering his resignation? If he had, he most certainly had deceived him&#x2014; he would not say intentionally, but he had deceived him&#x2014;for he would most distinctly assert, that it was impossible for any man who heard the promise of the right hon. gentleman on the 19th of December, to believe that it was his intention to resign on the 21st. The right hon. gentleman had stated, that no man who had heard
<image src="S2V0018P0I0305"/>
<col>595</col>
him could be dissatisfied with the explanation he had given in defence of his character. Upon that explanation, it was not his intention to offer any comment. He was not called upon to do it. It was a matter with which, in his opinion, the House had nothing to do: it being a point of honour between the right hon. gentleman and one of his colleagues; but, after the bold manner in which the right hon. gentleman had put the question, he would beg to ask in turn, whether, after the information he had received early in December, that nothing had been concluded on the subject of the appointment of lord Althorp, and that the application to that nobleman was merely to sound him as to whether he had any objection to accept the office of chairman, should it be determined by the government to nominate him&#x2014;he asked, whether, after that, any additional information on the subject had come to the right hon. gentleman's knowledge, before he wrote his letter of the 21st; and if not, on what ground had he assumed, that negotiations had been going on with respect to that appointment, and that it was completed? If he had received no additional information, how was he warranted in the assumption, unless he believed that the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Tierney) and the noble lord had combined to deceive him?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00407"><member>Lord Normanby</member><membercontribution> said, that the question which he had first introduced to the House had now arrived at that stage in which it could not be taken up beneficially by any person except the right hon. gentleman himself. The right hon. gentleman had said, that he had given an explanation which must be considered satisfactory. How far it tended to clear his character&#x2014;of course he meant his public character&#x2014;he would not inquire. Neither would he stop to examine how far a minister of the Crown was justified in throwing out insinuations against his late colleagues in office. On all these points he would leave the right hon. gentleman to the benefit of that opinion which he might very easily gather, from all sides of the House, during the present short discussion. He had risen for the purpose of setting the right hon. gentleman right on one point. Any further question he would not put, for the right hon. gentleman seemed as incapable of understanding any question put to him, as he was of answering it in a way in which it could be understood by others. The
<col>596</col>
question which he put was, not that to which, as had been observed by his learned friend, the right hon. gentleman had volunteered a gratuitous answer&#x2014;for, as to consultations with any individuals out of the cabinet, it would not have come into his head to ask. If any such thing occurred, that House was not the place where they should be noticed, and certainly he was not the person who would introduce the subject. The question he had asked was, how far the right hon. gentleman could concur in a statement made, in the other House, respecting his objections to the appointment of lord Althorp as chairman of the Finance Committee. It had been stated, by a noble lord (Goderich) that the righthon. gentleman had, at three different intervals, made different statements with respect to the appointment of lord Althorp. The first was, that he had no objection to the appointment: the second, that his objection arose chiefly from an implied slight towards him, in not having been consulted in the nomination; and the third, on the ground of lord Althorp's supposed political or party opinions; and the noble lord (Goderich) expressed his surprise that, after the explanation that the right hon. gentleman had received on these points, he should have persisted in what he stated, in his letter of the 21st of December, and have thus been the means of breaking up the government. To those questions, and to those only, he had directed the attention of the right hon. gentleman.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00408"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that the noble lord had correctly re-stated the points to which he had called his attention. To those points he conceived that he had already given a reply. He had stated his reasons for the delay which occurred between the 3rd of December and the letter he wrote on the 21st. For that, he thought, he had also satisfactorily accounted. But the noble lord objected, that he had shifted his ground, and stated a reason, at a subsequent interval, different from that which he had mentioned at first; and the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Wynn) said the same thing, and asked, why he had assumed that the nomination of lord Althorp was completed, when he had been already told that it was only proposed. He would answer, that he had a right to assume that the engagement was concluded; and let it be remembered, that when he read the letter to the House, he stated that he had so
<image src="S2V0018P0I0306"/>
<col>597</col>
assumed, in order that, if he were wrong he might be set right at once. The reason why he had assumed that the arrangement was completed, and next that it was made on party considerations, was because such was his impression, and because he wished that, if in that impression he was wrong, he should be set right without delay, by a denial of the correctness of those assumptions. Was that denial made? Was it stated that the arrangement was not concluded, or that it had not been made from party motives? No such denials had been given; nay more, was it not proved in the result, that the arrangement had been completed? [Cries of "No, no."] He repeated, he was justified in the assumption he had made, that it was so. He asked, had any bargain been made? No. Was there any understanding on the subject? Yes. Was it open to discussion? No. There was an understanding, it seemed, but the matter was not open to discussion. Then he maintained, that he was perfectly right in assuming these points as facts, in order that he might be undeceived at once if he were in error. And here he must remark upon the improper colouring, given by the noble lord who spoke last, to his letter, when he drew from it the conclusion, that it was written with a view to break up the government. Why, what was there in that letter which tended to destroy the government. Was not the offer made in fair and amicable terms, that he was willing to withdraw himself from the administration, in order that the government might; go on better? He had said petulantly that he would resign, lest any misconstruction should be put upon it; but finding that he differed from some of his colleagues on what he considered an important point, he calmly, and in the most friendly terms, offered to place his office at the disposal of the noble lord at the head of the government. He would refer the noble lord to the terms of his letter, to bear him out in that statement. Looking at that letter, ands bearing in mind the statement with which he had accompanied it, he called upon the noble lord&#x2014;divesting himself of all considerations of party feeling, and forgetting that he sat on the opposition side&#x2014;to state manfully what there was in its spirit tending to destroy the government. It showed that he was anxious to retire from office. Was that a great crime? Was it a great crime, that he was so little tenacious of the honours and emoluments of that office,
<col>598</col>
so little studious of his own private interests, and so anxious to prefer those of the public that he was ready to resign it? Was that, he begged to ask the noble lord, indicative of a disposition to destroy the government? He put it to the noble lord in candour whether, in this point of view, he had not wholly misunderstood the spirit of his letter? He would ask any gentleman of fair dealing, whether, when one man wrote to another, and stated his impression upon a particular subject&#x2014;when he mentioned to him, that such was his judgment and such his impression upon that subject, with the view that if he were in error he might be set right, by explanation or denial of what he assumed, and that there was no explanation and no denial given, he would not be warranted in concluding, that his assumption had been right, and his impression correct? But the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Wynn) had asked, whether, when at the return of lord Goderich to the government, and when he had promised to support him, he had any intention to resign? He would say in answer to this, that it was his intention to assert his own right, with respect to the finance committee. The fact was, that it was not his intention to resign at that time. Did it follow that, because he was disposed to assert his right on that point, that his resignation must have been the consequence? He had no right to assume that the noble lord at the head of the government would have denied him the justice he asked, or that his letter to him would be productive of his resignation. He had no right to assume that, after that letter, he was not to go on as before. This, then, was his anwswer to the questions put by the right hon. gentleman. The subject had not been a matter of consideration among his colleagues generally. It was not discussed in the cabinet. It was merely between himself and one of his right hon. friends; and therefore he trusted it would be readily conceded to him, that the time of the return of lord Goderich to the government was not the most proper for the introduction of such a matter, and to force it on the attention of the cabinet. Besides, he had no reason to believe that when he should mention the subject, the justice to which he thought he was entitled would be denied to him. He was not therefore disposed to press it at that moment. If he had done so, and introduced it to the cabinet, he had no doubt it would not
<image src="S2V0018P0I0307"/>
<col>599</col>
have met with consideration at that time; and the fact of his mentioning it might, perhaps, be taken as an indication that he wished to upset the government. It was because he had no such intention that he did not mention the subject on the 19th. He hoped this would be sufficient to satisfy the right hon. gentleman as to his motives for not pressing the matter, which, when it was pressed, was not, he knew, the cause of upsetting the government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00409"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, that from the feeling manifested by the House, it appeared to him that it was not its wish that this matter should be pressed further, the more particularly as no further explanation could be expected from the right hon. gentleman. There was only one word which he would add on the subject, in reference to what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman as to his (Mr. B. 's) not having spoken advisedly, when he stated that the right hon. gentleman had volunteered a gratuitous explanation. He begged to assure him, that he had spoken advisedly on that occasion, and he was borne out in it by his noble friend; for he remembered that the right hon. gentleman had alluded to attacks made upon him in the newspapers, and had culled and selected one point of attack, and had given his answer to it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MODE OF TAKING CITIES AND BOROUGHS POLLS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00411"><member>Colonel Davies</member><membercontribution> rose for leave to bring in a Bill, "for regulating the Mode of taking the Polls in Cities and Boroughs in England." In bringing forward this motion, he was, he said, the organ of a committee appointed to inquire into the abuses which it was proposed by the bill to remedy. The object of the bill was to extend the facilities of voting at present enjoyed by electors; and the mode in which it was proposed to do so, was by increasing the number of places at which polls were taken, and by limiting the duration of those elections. At present every election presented a scene of licentiousness and riot; the contest was always a source of immense expense; and by the stagnation of business, and the interruption of all affairs of trade, the loss was greatly increased. He anticipated no opposition, and should at present confine himself to his motion for leave to bring in the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00412"><member>Mr. Robinson</member><membercontribution> said, he was disposed to
<col>600</col>
agree with his hon. colleague, that some measure was necessary to correct the evils of the present system of polling; but, at the same time he thought that great caution should be observed not to abridge the rights of those who possessed the elective franchise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00413"><member>Lord Lowther</member><membercontribution> thought it necessary to have a number of booths and polling places in large towns, to avoid the access to the hustings being blocked up by the adverse parties. He should look with jealousy to the progress of the bill, as it appeared to him not to afford sufficient time for bringing up voters from London to distant places.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00414"><member>Mr. Batley</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that all the evils complained of under the present system, arose from the too long duration of the time of polling. In the borough which he represented, the election was generally, concluded in one day, and the number of voters polled on the last occasion was one thousand five hundred, including three hundred out-voters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00415"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> said, that the existing inconveniences were allowed on all hands. By shortening the period, and lessening the expenses of elections, the House would, he was convinced, be enlarging; and not restraining the elective franchise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00416"><member>Mr. Fyler</member><membercontribution> disapproved of increasing the number of polling booths.

<p id="S2V0018P0-00417"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, that six days, the term proposed in the bill for the duration of the poll, appeared to him insufficient.

<p id="S2V0018P0-00421"><member>Mr. Courtenay</member> moved for leave to bring in a bill "to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to Friendly Societies."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00422"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that great anxiety existed as to the object which the hon. gentleman had in view. An idea prevailed, that it was the intention of the hon. member to take away from friendly societies the power of appointing their treasurers and other officers; which, in the opinion of persons connected with those societies, would destroy the system altogether. He was satisfied that the hon. member had no such intention; but hoped that, to allay the apprehensions of others, he would take that opportunity of stating what his object was.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00423"><member>Mr. Courtenay</member><membercontribution> said, it might be a sufficient answer to what had fallen from the hon. member, to state that the bill which he proposed to bring in, did not in any degree affect the societies formed otherwise than under the act which he had the honour to introduce in 1819. The new bill would interfere no further in the matter of appointing officers than the former bill did. The existing act required that there should be certain trustees, and that they should appoint the treasurer. The act interfered in no other way with the management of the societies; so far from it, that all clauses in former acts relating to their management were repealed by it. Except in the matter of securities, the societies framed under his act had more direct management of their affairs than those framed under Mr. Rose's act. The act he had introduced was intended to obviate the numerous evils which resulted from miscalculation; for which purpose it provided, that justices should not allow any society to be formed, whose tables of payments and benefits should not have been approved by two competent actuaries. In the execution of this provision, however, a difficulty arose: it was not easy to know who were competent actuaries. To get rid of this obstacle, he would propose, in the bill he was about to introduce, that the rules and tables exhibited at the sessions should be, by the clerk of the peace,
<col>602</col>
transmitted to the only government-office in London which possessed a professional actuary; namely, the office of the Commissioners for reducing the National Debt.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PAROCHIAL SETTLEMENTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00426"><member>Mr. Potter Macqueen</member><membercontribution> rose, pursuant to notice, to move for a select committee" to take into consideration the Law of Parochial Settlements." The hon. member said, that after deliberating whether be should embody at once the alterations which he proposed to make in the laws relating to parochial settlement into a distinct bill, or ask for a committee of inquiry, he had thought it his duty to prefer the latter mode; because, if it should be thought that there was too much of novelty in his views, they would be better digested and come with stronger recommendation from the hon. members whom he intended to propose as a committee.&#x2014;The first objection against the laws relative to parochial settlements was, that they were founded upon ancient habits of serfship, and militated against the liberty of the subject. Under the present system, the unfortunate pauper, on the approach of illness, age, or disability, might, together with his family, be dragged like criminals from one end of the country to the other, that they were finally lodged in some obscure parish, where, according to the opinion of any two magistrates in the vicinity, they had done some act to entitle them to a settlement. This harsh and evil policy had been strongly deprecated by sir William Blackstone and by Mr. Pitt. The former had declared, in his Commentaries that, "notwithstanding the pains which have been taken about the laws of settlement, they still remain very imperfect, and inadequate to the purposes they are designed for: a fate that has generally attended most of our statute laws, where they have not the foundation I of the common law to build on. When the shires, the hundreds, and the tithings, were kept in the same admirable order, that they were disposed in by the great Alfred, there were no persons idle; consequently none but the impotent that needed relief; and the 43rd Statute of I Elizabeth seems entirely founded on the same principle. But when this excellent scheme was neglected and departed from, we cannot but observe with concern, what
<image src="S2V0018P0I0309"/>
<col>603</col>
miserable shifts and lame expedients have from time to time been adopted, in order to patch up the flaws occasioned by this neglect." Mr. Pitt also had, in the year 1796, declared in that House, that the law of settlement "had been peculiarly prejudicial to industry; for, by preventing the circulation of labour, it had increased the burthens of the country, and by oppressing individuals diminished the riches of the state."&#x2014;The hon. member then referred to the statutes of Richard 2nd, Henry 7th, and Edward 6th, c. 1, which were enacted to repress "vagabondry," and directed the poor to repair to the place where they were born, or were most conversant with for three years;&#x2014;to the modification of these laws by the act of James 1st, which reduced this qualification to one year; and to the 43rd of Elizabeth. During her long reign, a system of miserable expedients might be traced, of entreating, asking, demanding, and enforcing, charity. To the provisions of the act made in the latter period of her reign, might be attributed, no less the present miserable burthen on the landed interest, than the wretched and humiliating degradation of the poor themselves. From that time to the Restoration, in the 13th and 14th of Charles 2nd, the statutes so rapidly multiplied, that regular notice of them would be almost impossible. He would therefore turn to the heads of settlement, in order to ascertain what clauses might be satisfactorily pointed out for revision; or, if it should be thought fit, for extirpation.&#x2014;The first was the "Law of Hiring, and Service." Exclusive of the extravagant litigation which, from the number of appeal causes&#x2014;three thousand in three years&#x2014;which the law as it at present stood gave rise to, the effect was most pernicious, as far as it regarded the moral condition of the poor. Some years ago, said the hon. member, the residence of every respectable farmer presented a school for domestic and agricultural pursuits. It contained a number of hired servants of both sexes, who dwelt under the same roof, and not unfrequently lived at the same board with their masters and mistresses. They were, consequently, identified with their prosperity; and anxious to repay the kindness they experienced, by every attention to the interests of their employers. There they acquired habits of honesty, sobriety, and regular industry; there, too, the romance of humble life was
<col>604</col>
played off, and instead of rushing into precipitate marriage, as at present, the parties remained in service a few years, reserving their mutual wages, and then coming together with the full consent and approbation of their employers, to whom they looked for support and encouragement in after life. What was now the contrast? At present, the farmer dared not hire a labourer out of another parish, for fear he should become an inmate of his own; and when he looked to that parish he found the demand so inadequate to the supply, that he was unfortunately too often induced to prefer the wretched system of roundsmen to that of the fairly remunerated and independent labourer.&#x2014;Another, and a most important branch of the general subject was settlement by marriage. That the wife should follow the settlement of the husband appeared at first sight only just and reasonable, but to the perversion of this law much evil might be attributed.&#x2014;At present, a female of the poorest class had not only no motive to preserve her character, but on the contrary, she had every inducement to forfeit her reputation; as, by so doing, she was likely to obtain not merely a husband, but, what was to her of much greater consequence, a right to select a certain parish, and by swearing her child to a man of that parish, compel him to marry her. The consequence of these forced marriages was obvious; the peasantry were married whilst mere children, and before they had formed any virtuous or lasting attachments; certainly, before they had laid by any reserve to meet the future exigencies of a family. They considered that family as the property of the parish which must maintain them. They were brought up dependent upon the parish, and independent of their parents; and in fact&#x2014;to use an expression formerly applied&#x2014;as legitimate paupers.&#x2014;What he hoped to effect was, that in so serious and solemn a moral obligation, no legal compulsion whatever should be exerted: there might, probably, be difficulties, chiefly as to providing for natural children; still, no system of general policy which militated against domestic morality could be publicly justified. Now, the most simple and efficacious remedy in this case would be to enact, that in all cases where a child might be born within six months of the marriage of the parents, such a child should belong to the parish of the mother, and not of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0310"/>
<col>605</col>
father. This would put a stop to the juggling system of overseers, who urged their own females to lay their children to men of other parishes, in the hope of removing them; quite forgetful, that the evil was reciprocal, and that if an overseer got rid of three or four females in a year under these circumstances, the same number of his own young men must have been driven into marriage; and thus this wretched system had, consequently, proceeded with mutual infliction of severity.&#x2014;This measure would also teach the overseer what he ought to have known long ago&#x2014;that he; ought rather to apply the power with which he was armed to the prevention of mischief &#x2014;that he ought to look to the early habits of his youthful poor, and endeavour to repress the first symptoms of evil, instead of hoping to profit by the completion of that evil. But, above all, it would teach one most important lesson to the female herself; namely, that as the law, by its strongest enactments had made her the guardian of her own character, such she must remain; and that she would have to attribute her after-success in life to the preservation of her reputation, instead of, as at present, the forfeiture of it.&#x2014;The hon. member concluded by moving for the appointment of the said committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00427"><member>Colonel Wood</member><membercontribution> said, he thought it would be advisable to give the powers of the committee a wider range, as there were many other points, with respect to the Poor Laws, which must necessarily force themselves upon their consideration. In some parts of the country, the rate of wages was so low, that even a single man could with difficulty support himself without parochial aid. It was not his intention to trespass upon the attention of the House on that occasion; but if no other member took the matter up, he should feel it his duty to move, that the committee should have power to embrace the more general question of the Poor-laws.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00428">The motion was agreed to, and a committee appointed. The name of the Attorney-general being included,</p>

<title>ROMAN CATHOLIC LAND TAX BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00431"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member> moved the order of the day for the second reading of this bill.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00432"><member>Mr. Curteis</member><membercontribution> wished to state some objections which he felt, not so much towards the principle of the proposed measure, as to some of its details. He thought it would tend to the ultimate success of the bill, if it were to undergo a little more consideration. The bill had been passed last year in the House of Commons, but had been lost in the other House. Upon the former occasion, the late chancellor of the Exchequer had said, "Where there's a will there's a way," an expression, the meaning of which he did not understand at the time, but which he since understood to mean that, although there was a will to pass the measure in the House of Commons, there was a way to get rid of it in the House of Lords; and so it proved. Before it passed, he should like to know, whether it was likely to be productive of serious loss to the country. If the tax, as it at present existed, operated as a hardship upon Roman Catholics in particular, he was the last man to wish for its continuance. But if the Land-tax was felt as a grievance, then the general question had better go before the finance committee. It had always been an impression upon his mind, that the hon. mover of the bill was rather hostile to the Roman Catholics; but he supposed the hon. member introduced this motion as a sort of balsam &#x2014;that he intended by it to pour oil into the wounds of that body. He disclaimed all hostility to the Roman Catholics. He cared not whether a man came from Canterbury or Rome, and thought that the Roman Catholic ought not to pay a larger amount of taxation than the Protestant. So much for the policy of the bill; it was much more material to consider its justice. There was, in his opinion, no hardship whatever in the existing system; or if any, it fell almost entirely on the inhabitants of the southern counties of England; and they, in his opinion, had a stronger claim to relief than the Roman Catholics.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00433"><member>Mr. Fyler</member><membercontribution> said, he should be the last man in the world to object to a measure like the present, which was intended to do justice to persons whose rights appeared to have been injured; but, at the same time, as the indulgence which was now sought to be granted to the Catholics must come out of the public purse, he thought it was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0311"/>
<col>607</col>
necessary that the House should see clearly that the persons who would receive benefit from this act were the parties really entitled to relief. With respect to the earl of Shrewsbury, lord Dormer, and the other noble personages, who had clearly suffered from this double assessment, he was willing not only to give them relief, but to remunerate them for what they had already paid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00434"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, he was ready to support the principle of this bill, for the same reasons which had induced him to support it in the last session. But he thought, that instead of debating the principle of the measure, on which he believed they were all agreed, they ought to let the bill go into the next stage, where they might discuss the best mode of obviating the difficulties which were anticipated to its practical operation. He agreed that, to impose a different rate of duty on different classes of the community, on account of the difference in their religious creeds, was a doctrine which no man of common sense, at the present day, would advocate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00435"><member>The Attorney-General</member><membercontribution> said, he knew that the statute of William 3rd, being held a very severe measure against the Roman Catholics, had, by collusion and connivance on the part of the early commissioners, never been carried into execution against them. The difficulty, therefore, would be to ascertain the fact, whether the Roman Catholic proprietor had had a double assessment placed upon his land in the time of king William, according to its then real value. He was not satisfied with the nature of the proof which the present bill provided on that point; on the contrary, he thought that the legal advisers of the Crown should have an opportunity of bringing it under revision. There was another provision of the bill with which he was not satisfied. When Mr. Pitt made the Land-tax, perpetual, it followed as a matter of course, that no change could take place in the assessments which were then made, and not appealed against within a given time, An opportunity was then given to the Roman Catholics to get rid of their assessment of 8<i>s.</i> in the pound; of which, however, in some instances, they had not availed themselves. Now, since that time Protestants had bought of Catholics land subject to the double assessment, and had, in consequence of that assessment, given a less sum for it. If they were enabled by this act to get rid of the
<col>608</col>
double assessment, it would not be a boon to the Catholic but to the Protestant landholder. These were the two points of difficulty which he could not get over. He concurred in those feelings of justice which induced the House to adopt this bill to a certain extent, and should be happy to offer his services in the committee, to put it into such a shape as would protect the rights of all parties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00436"><member>Mr. Hurst</member><membercontribution> explained the mode in which the commissioners of Land-tax disposed of appeals against the inequality of the tax in his district. He had no great alarm, as to the sum which the revenue would lose by the passing of this measure; for he knew that there was not, in the extensive county of Sussex, a single Catholic who would have occasion to appeal under it; and he believed that the same was the case in Surrey. He was of opinion that public justice required the bill to be passed, and that the thanks of the country were due to the law officers of the Crown for not meeting it with any unnecessary opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00437"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, that he did not look upon this measure as a boon to the Catholics, but as an act of tardy justice. When the act was passed, which made the Land-tax perpetual, the inequality with which it pressed upon the Roman Catholics was dwelt upon by Mr. Pitt. He used phrases which showed that he considered it to be owing to the carelessness of Protestants, that an inequality existed among them; and said, that he could not allow that inequality to be urged as a reason for delaying the passing of his bill, which it was well known was an important financial measure. Not a word further was said at that time by the Roman Catholics; for at that time, too, there was no Roman Catholic in the House to advocate their cause. He, who had always opposed the admission of Catholics into parliament, on national grounds, never supposed that it was not a hardship upon them, that they had not individuals in the House to advocate their rights, and therefore he agreed with the Attorney-general, that though it might not be hard to let the Protestants suffer for their neglect, they were bound to show greater indulgence to Roman Catholics. In cases, therefore, where Protestants paid an equal assessment with Catholics, he did not pretend, by this bill, to give any remedy. The law, however, professed to remedy the injustice which
<image src="S2V0018P0I0312"/>
<col>609</col>
had been inflicted on Roman Catholics, and did not; and all that he now proposed to do was, to assist the law in its operation. The English Roman Catholics had not been passive under the present injustice of the law, but had sought redress for it by every legal means in their power. Lord Shrewsbury, who had six different estates in six different counties, paid on them all, with one exception, precisely the same sum as was first charged upon them fifty years ago. He got rid of the double charge upon an estate which he had in Oxfordshire, by an appeal to the commissioners tinder the act of 1794. But even that was attended with great difficulty. He had to apply to the Court of King's Bench for a mandamus, to compel the commissioners to hear his appeal. He had to take counsel down to the country to try his cause, and at last, in 1799, he got 10<i>l.</i> or 20<i>l.</i> taken off a land tax of 260<i>l.</i> a-year. Suppose the noble lord was right in the course which he had then adopted, he had paid on his five other estates upwards of 600<i>l.</i> a-year in land-tax, more than he ought; a payment which, he understood, could be traced back for sixty years, by muniments in his lordship's keeping.&#x2014;He hoped he should be able to exempt by this bill, not only the lands of Catholics but also those purchased by Protestants, and which were hitherto liable to double assessments. With a generosity which did them the highest honour, the Catholics of England were desirous, in the event of the measure passing, that the exemption should be made universal. He trusted that in the committee, he should receive the assistance of the law officers of the Crown to remove whatever legal difficulties might arise.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARMY ESTIMATES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00439">The House having resolved itself into a committee, to which the Army Estimates were referred,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00440"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, that for the convenience of the House, he would, in proposing the vote, instead of taking half the sum required on each item, or instead of proposing the whole sum on each for six months, take a certain sum on account of the whole. This would be for the convenience of the House, as many of the items involved matters which would pro-
<col>610</col>
perly come under the consideration of the Finance Committee, and had therefore be better postponed. It was necessary that a certain sum should be provided to carry on the service of the year, and that the Mutiny act should be passed, which hon. members knew would expire in the course of next month. The whole of the sum for the land force was 3,100,000<i>l.</i> Of this he proposed to take 2,000,000<i>l.</i> on account, which would leave a balance of 1,200,000<i>l.</i>. and when the subject came to be discussed, and the amount of each item to be determined, there would be sufficient for the House on which to make what diminution it might think proper. The estimates were made out at the maximum. The way in which he proposed the vote would leave the question of numbers to the consideration of the Finance Committee, as much as if the vote had been taken for six months instead of a year. Besides the 2,000,000<i>l.</i> on account of the land forces, he would take 1,000,000<i>l.</i> on account of the out-pensioners of Chelsea. The whole sum for that was 1,200,000<i>l.</i> This item was one on which no reduction could be made, consistently with the observance of national faith. The amount of pensions already granted must be continued daring the life-time of the parties; and, if any recommendation on the subject of the amount of these pensions should be made by the Finance Committee, it must be prospective. By the vote which he should propose, the present wants of the service, would be provided for, without pledging the House to the amount of any particular item. He did not mean at present to enter into any detailed explanation; but he thought it right to say a few words on the addition to our force, which appeared on the face of the estimates. This arose, from bringing into the account the colonial corps, which heretofore were charged on the colonial revenues. This applied to the colonial corps, and also to the regiments of the line and staff employed in Ceylon and the Mediterranean. These, as he had said, appeared to be charged on the colonial revenue; but, though so, charged, they still came out of the ordinaries of the army, as the colonies drew for then on those ordinaries, and often, for more than the amount so expended. It was, therefore, a fallacy to leave it as a charge coming out of another fund, when in fact the greater part
<image src="S2V0018P0I0313"/>
<col>611</col>
was to be made by this country, in the same way as the other ordinaries of the army. It would be better that the whole should be brought into one account. This plan had been suggested by the noble lord not long since at the head of the Colonial department, and had been concurred in and adopted by the right hon. gentleman now at the head of that office. In future, therefore, the Colonial troops would be included in the ordinary of the army, and whatever surplus revenue accrued in the colonies would be accounted for by the chancellor of the Exchequer, and brought into the ways and means of the year. He had mentioned this alteration, to account for the apparent increase of three thousand in the number of men, though in reality there was a diminution of five thousand owing to the check on our recruiting establishment, which would be only six thousand this year; whereas it had been fifteen thousand last year. The recruiting establishment of the present year would it was hoped be sufficient to maintain our force in an effective state, as that force would be five thousand less than it was last year. Now, the effect of the arrangement he had mentioned respecting the colonial corps would be, that they would take credit for a diminution of expense of only 14,000<i>l.</i>, while the real saving would be from 150,000<i>l.</i> to 160,000<i>l.</i> This saving would be thus made up on the land forces, including the addition of three thousand men:&#x2014;On account of pay 25,000<i>l.</i>; saving in recruiting department 26,000<i>l.</i>; saving in addition of pay for length of service to officers and men, as there were fewer this year than last 17,000<i>l.</i>; saving in the charges for Yeomanry 86,000<i>l.</i>; making 154,900<i>l.</i>; which, with a saving on other items of 4,000<i>l.</i>; made in all a difference of 158,000<i>l.</i> less than the amount of last year. It was true that a great part of this would be absorbed by bringing the colonial corps into the general account; so that though the real saving was great, the apparent saving was but small. He would abstain from further explanation, until it should be determined what was to be the amount of our establishments for the year, and would move his first resolution; but with the distinct understanding that it would be fully competent to any member hereafter to renew the discussion on the whole amount of force to be kept, and the expense at which
<col>612</col>
it was to be maintained. The noble lord then moved that ninety-one thousand and seventy-five men be kept up as the land force of the year, including commissioned and non-commissioned officers, and exclusive of the force kept up for the service of the East India company.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00441"><member>Colonel Davies</member><membercontribution> expressed his surprise at the statement made by the noble lord. They had been told over and over again, that the troops employed in some of the colonies were paid <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> out of the revenue of those colonies, and that the House had nothing to do with the payment. Now, it was admitted, that the whole was a delusion, and that the payment of those troops was to be defrayed by this country. He was glad, however, to find that a new light had broken in upon the noble lord on this point. "The management of the colonies had hitherto been marked by a most wasteful expenditure. Of this, numerous instances might be given, but he would mention only one. Before the Cape of Good Hope had come into our possession, it paid its own expenses out of its own revenue, and left a considerable surplus; but the moment it came into our hands, that revenue was found insufficient, and it became a charge on the country. It would seem as if we sought colonies solely for the purpose of quartering and pensioning upon them the junior branches of our nobility. Though, he was glad to find that we were likely to come to a better system, he could not go along with the noble lord in the course he proposed. Why should we have a Mutiny-bill for six months, and a vote of supply for the same time? That course would not, as in his opinion the present did, pledge the House technically to keep-up a force of ninety-one thousand men. If government were disposed to reduce the public expenditure, why not refer the estimates at once to the Finance Committee, where they had the means of going into the most minute investigation? Indeed, after what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman on a former evening, he had every hope from the labours of the committee. Considering the circumstances of the country, our military establishments were altogether too large. He would not compare them with those of 1792, but would only go a few years back. Looking at our establishment in 1823, he found that, with as much cause for a large force as at present, it was twenty-one thousand
<image src="S2V0018P0I0314"/>
<col>613</col>
men less, and cost 650,000<i>l.</i> less than the force of the present year. The noble lord said, that our expenditure was 158,000<i>l.</i> less this year than the last. He, however, could not make that out. We had now to pay for a nominal force of ninety-one thousand men, but we could not bring eighty thousand effective men into the field. This arose from the practice of having d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t companies attached to each corps, which amounted to eleven thousand non-effective men, and whose charge raised the expense about 450,000<i>l.</i> But, putting that out of the question, he found fault with the force kept up as being too large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00442"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, that, as he had not had an opportunity of addressing the House before it went into the committee, he would avail himself of the present. Looking at the amount of the estimates, notwithstanding what had been stated by the right hon. gentleman on the subject, he despaired of any plan which could be pointed out, until he saw an effectual reformation in the public expenditure. It had been said, that they were now called upon only to vote the men, and that they could afterwards diminish the supply, if they should not approve of what might be done by the Finance Committee. But he considered it the duty of the House, in the first instance, to the down the government to a particular vote; and there would be no doubt but the establishment would be reduced in proportion to that vote. As to the Finance Committee, he had a high respect for many of the names placed on it; but, recollecting that he had never seen any public advantage result from any former Finance Committee, he had no expectations from the present. Such committees were, in general, a delusion on the public. They were appointed only to get over the difficulty of the moment, and were never resorted to, until ministers were driven as it were into a corner by their own extravagance. He wished to know what was intended. This, however, was not to be obtained, until after the Finance Committee should report; and thus the delay which ministers required would be obtained. They were told of a general desire for economy; but when any particular reduction was pointed out, there was always some attempt to evade it. If a reduction of colonial expenditure were mentioned, it was met by talking of the necessity of keeping our possessions in an effective state. Reduc-
<col>614</col>
tions proposed in the navy were answered by the necessity of upholding that great national bulwark. Reductions in the army were opposed on some other ground; and thus the several professions of economy turned out to mean nothing. He remembered that, on one occasion, lord Castlereagh had come down to the House, and made a speech characterized by the true spirit of economy, in which he recommended that the establishments should be reduced. The noble lord had been driven into that course by the refusal of the House to vote the Property-tax. If that tax had been granted, the minister would have said nothing about economy. So long as ministers could raise money, they represented the country as being in the most flourishing condition: it was only when the supplies were denied them that they admitted the necessity of relieving the burthens of the people. The right hon. gentleman had stated, on a former night, that the income of the country, for the last five years, was 261,000,000<i>l.</i>, and the expenditure 249,000,000<i>l.</i>, leaving a surplus of 12,000,000<i>l.</i>; but this surplus was to meet a sinking fund of 5,000,000<i>l.</i> per annum for five years, so that, in fact, there was a deficiency of 13,000,000<i>l.</i> Yet the House was now called upon to vote a standing army of ninety-one thousand men in time of peace, with all our debts and embarrassments about us. The country could not bear new taxation: if it were taxed further, it must be under a government with a military commander for its head, and at the point of the bayonet. He begged the attention of the House to a statement of the expenditure of the country for the last five years. In 1823, it was 47,500,000<i>l.</i>; in 1824, 49,500,000<i>l.</i>; in 1825,48,500,000<i>l.</i>; in 1826,49,500,000<i>l.</i>; in 1827, 49,500,000<i>l.</i>; being an increase of 4,500,000<i>l.</i> on the five years. In 1823, the current expenses of the year, independently of the interest on the national debt, was 18,500,000<i>l.</i>; in 1824, 20,500,000<i>l.</i>; in 1825, 20,000,000<i>l.</i>; in 1826, 21,500,000<i>l.</i>; in 1827, 21,500,000<i>l.</i>; making an increase in the four years of 9,500,000<i>l.</i> It was shocking to think that the expenditure of the country should thus go on increasing, whilst the people were labouring under privations of the most extreme nature. In one parish in the city of London, containing only four hundred houses, one hundred and ninety-three persons had been summoned for non-payment of the Poor-rates.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0315"/>
<col>615</col>
The workhouse of that parish was full; beside which there were a large number of out-pensioners. On the surface of society every thing bore the appearance of prosperity, but poverty was extensively spreading. Knowing this, he should be neglectful of his duty, if he did not protest against maintaining a standing army of ninety-one thousand men. We seemed, now a days, to have quite forgotten all the notions of Our ancestors, and probably he should be laughed at for alluding to them; nevertheless it might not be improper to remind the House, that we had no standing army before the Revolution. In king William's time, when the Pretender was endeavouring to overthrow the government, the army did not exceed seven thousand men; but now we had of cavalry alone eight thousand, with eight thousand horses, devouring the country. It was shameful that the people should be taxed to maintain eight thousand horses, which were in no way necessary to the protection of the country. In the time of George 1st and George 2nd, great opposition was always offered to the votes for augmenting the standing army, though it was only proposed to raise it to sixteen thousand. Sir R. Walpole, however, had something like a plea for maintaining an army: the Pretender still prosecuted his designs, and there had been a rebellion in the country. He had to learn, however, what there was in the actual circumstances of the country which called for a standing army of ninety-one thousand men. On constitutional grounds it was highly objectionable that so large a force should be maintained. A standing army had proved dangerous in all countries; and it did not satisfy him, to assert that the military man now at the head of our government was not disposed to make a mischievous use of the instrument which was placed in his hands. The precedent was a bad one.&#x2014;After again urging the necessity of retrenchment, the worthy alderman said, he could place no reliance on the stability of the present government. One government had already been blown up, and as there were two barrels of gunpowder placed under the present, it was likely to suffer a similar fate. How long it would be before it was blown up, how long its members could hang together&#x2014;that was an untoward word&#x2014;some persons might be wicked enough to say they ought to hang together&#x2014;he could not pretend to guess. On the appointment of the
<col>616</col>
Finance Committee the other night, the House was grievously disappointed. It was waiting in anxious expectation, to hear, not an exposition of the financial concerns of the country, but what sort of explanations two right hon. gentlemen would make. On that occasion they made no explanation, but subsequently they had; and God knew, a poor kind of explanation it was&#x0021; It left the House as much in the dark as before. For his part, he could put no confidence in a government of which those two right hon. gentlemen formed a part; and he was only sorry that honourable members, who had cut one of the right hon. gentlemen to shreds and patches and totally demolished him, should have allowed the other to escape. Some explanation was still wanted. The country wanted it. It was impossible to walk the streets, to go on the Royal Exchange, or to enter a coffee-house, without hearing that explanation called for. The country expected that men appointed to conduct the affairs of the nation should be distinguished for high and honourable feeling&#x2014;that they should be above all paltry subterfuge. Those also were his feelings; and it was, therefore, with the greatest amazement he had heard the explanations on a former evening. When a right hon. gentleman was asked why he had not told Mr. Tierney what was going on, till all the ministers were turned out-why he did not mention the circumstance to lord Lansdowne&#x2014;why he did not state it in his letter to Mr. Tierney&#x2014;"Oh," said he, "I had no business with it; it was quite sufficient for me to send in my resignation to the first lord of the treasury." When the right hon. gentlemen were driven hard, when they put out the signal of distress, when they could not form a government without inviting the co-operation of such men as lord Lansdowne and Mr. Tierney, they availed themselves of their influence, and the assistance of their friends, but at last they turned tail on them, and provided for themselves in the best way they could. In so doing, the right hon. gentleman had, in his opinion, acted, with duplicity. He knew nothing of the way in which cabinet ministers were accustomed to act; but in the common affairs of life, if such a case had arisen as that which led to the dissolution of the last cabinet, communication would have taken place, and the colleagues of the right hon. gentleman would have said
<image src="S2V0018P0I0316"/>
<col>617</col>
"let us talk over the matter and consult as to what shall be done." He had heard that when "virtue admits of parley she is near surrender;" but the two right hon. gentlemen had surrendered without any parley. They found themselves in the arms of each other, and surrounded by their new colleagues, nobody knew how. Such conduct could excite only contempt&#x2014;it was a standing jest&#x2014;the government was degraded by it; and if parliament allowed itself to be governed by such a ministry, it would be a degradation to them and an insult to the country. With respect to the present chancellor of the Exchequer, he had known him in one capacity, but of his fitness for his new office he knew nothing. With respect to the late chancellor, we were told that his loss could not be supplied&#x2014;he was so efficient&#x2014;so ready at accounts&#x2014;so intimately acquainted with all the intricacies of finance&#x2014;yet all at once, he had been deprived of the office for which he was so peculiarly fitted. The allotment of parts in the cabinet really appeared ludicrous&#x2014;quite as much so as it would be to put Mr. Liston in Sir George Airy, and Mr. Kemble in Tony Lumpkin. The late chancellor of the Exchequer was sent to repose at the Mint. God knew what he was to do there. He rather thought the right hon. gentleman was a great encumberance to government. As to the pledges which had been so much alluded to, he did not believe that any would be given under the present government which were not signed on the drum head. He thought that no pledges had been given to a right hon. gentleman, and if not, he had deserted his principles by joining the administration. He concluded by urging the House to watch over the public money, as that was the only hold they had of a profligate government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00443"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> contended, that the present vote would by no means compromise the right of the House hereafter to reduce any of the votes, should the Finance Committee recommend their reduction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00444"><member>Mr. Maberly</member><membercontribution> was anxious to put the committee of supply on its guard against sanctioning certain numbers for the army or navy, under the idea that the Finance Committee would correct any extravagance which should hereafter be found to attach to the present vote. He admitted that there were difficulties respecting the ad-
<col>618</col>
justment of the numbers, owing to the possible operation of the secret article in the treaty of last July,&#x2014;a treaty which he considered inexpedient, unjust, and contrary to the real principles of the law of nations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00445"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> admitted that it would not be constitutional for the House to allow its legitimate functions to be usurped by any committee appointed to inquire into the revenues of the country, and that even after such committee should have examined and decided upon details, the House would still have the power of adopting or rejecting such recommendations. He had already explained what he considered to be the nature of the duty which devolved on the Finance Committee: he had stated that it was very difficult to lay down precise rules for their government, because of the confidential political information upon which the administration might be called upon to act; for instance, in such a possible event as the execution of the secret article of the Greek treaty. With respect to the Finance Committee, they were at that moment inquiring into the navy estimates, and had summoned before them one of the lords of the Admiralty and the Secretary. Their purpose was, to ascertain, starting from the point of 1792, why the establishments should continue upon an increasing scale. He thought himself bound to congratulate the worthy alderman upon the ample proof he had afforded of the necessity of establishing this Finance Committee; for at a time when the sole subject before them was the army estimates, he had wandered into references to the dissolution of the late government, and explanations which had arisen out of them. In the Finance Committee these digressions could not take place, and their real business would no doubt, in consequence, be better attended to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00446"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> thought there was a great contradiction in the course pursued by the noble Secretary at War, in calling for a vote of 3,000,000<i>l.</i>, and ninety-one thousand men, while at the same time he reserved his explanations until the Finance Committee had decided upon what ought or ought not to be the establishments for the year. By this mode of proceeding the House was divested of its constitutional jurisdiction. Why not take a Mutiny bill for the same period as the noble lord required his vote? Hon. gentlemen talked
<image src="S2V0018P0I0317"/>

of the injudicious operation of the Greek treaty, but they forgot that the military expenditure was also connected with the Portuguese treaty. As to the observations of the right hon. gentleman upon the speech of the worthy alderman, he thought them ill-timed, for it would be difficult to define what could be termed an extraneous debate, in a committee of supply upon the army estimates; sure he was, that it was the very opportunity, in the best parliamentary times, when Fox, and Pitt, and Burke, and Windham, travelled largely into the whole sphere of the foreign and domestic politics of the country.&#x2014;As to the appointment of the Finance Committee, he hailed it as a good omen: nothing but the difficulties of the state had compelled the government to agree to it; and now that the country had such a committee, and an entire set of new performers at the Treasury, he hoped for fair play for the national energies. He did think it was a peculiar advantage, that new men were in the offices of the Treasury, such as the First Lord, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;men who were not pledged to, or implicated in, the deceits and disgusting quackeries which had previously been practised in the making up of the public accounts. The Finance Committee would open the real state of the finances, and place the details in an intelligible form. If fairly looked at, he saw no cause of alarm in the condition of the country; no reason for new taxation, or borrowing for a Sinking-fund; but if the Finance Committee could reduce expenditure, so as to create a surplus applicable to the extinction of the debt, he had no objection to its being soused; unless, indeed, it accumulated to a large amount; for then he thought a grave consideration would arise, whether the public ought not to have the benefit of it in a reduction of taxation; for they might surely rely upon it, that the money would fructify and improve more in the pockets of the people than in the hands of the state. He agreed that there were political considerations which the government must keep from the Finance Committee under certain circumstances; but there was one item of the military force, which ought and could be diminished&#x2014;he alluded to the twenty-two thousand men for Ireland. He implored the government to adopt a better policy, and to relieve that country from the ex-
<col>620</col>
pense of so burthensome an establishment. The very circumstance of such a military Force being called for in Ireland, showed how bad must be the system which prevailed in that country, and led in addition to this expense of 1,000,000<i>l.</i> a year to the inundation of England and Scotland with thousands of Irish paupers, who forced the English labourer upon the Poor's-rates, and carried misery in their rain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00447"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, he was opposed to these votes without further explanation; for it was in that House, and not in the Finance Committee, that the necessary information ought to be forthcoming. With the change of men from this time last year, he had looked forward to a change of measures, and yet no serious alteration had taken place. It was not, he knew, for the Treasury, but for the cabinet to decide upon the number of troops to be maintained; still, the incidental payments ought to be clearly defined, and not kept in that state of delusion which now prevailed. He had over and over again impressed upon the noble lord opposite, that the Treasury had to pay a large part of the military expense of the colonies, but this had always been denied; yet in Ceylon, the Cape, and Malta, the thing was now obvious. Why not reduce the military staff, which amounted to 140,000<i>l.</i> although it was only from 15,000<i>l.</i> to 18,000<i>l.</i> in 1792? Why not do away with the gross delusion of the Sinking-fund. Was the country to be perpetually contracting debt in a time of profound peace? He called on ministers, before they asked the House to agree to the present estimates, to state why those estimates were so enormous in amount? He would not call upon them to return to the scale on which the estimates were formed in 1792, when the whole military force of the empire did not exceed thirty-six thousand men. At that time, the number of troops stationed in Ireland was not more than eight thousand five hundred men: at present, we kept twenty-three thousand men there, independently of the militia-staff, and four thousand or five thousand armed constables. Ireland was now garrisoned by thirty thousand men, of whom twenty-four thousand were kept by the money of England, and the rest by a levy on the people of Ireland. But if ministers could not reduce the establishments to the scale of 1792, why not reduce them to the level
<image src="S2V0018P0I0318"/>
<col>621</col>
of 1823, when the naval force consisted of sixteen thousand, and the military of forty thousand men? Why should we have at present a military force of ninety thousand men, and a naval of thirty thousand, exclusive of six thousand artillery men? Why should we have a force of one hundred and twenty thousand men now, when in 1792 a third part of that force was deemed sufficient for all the service of the country? After this disclosure of the pecuniary resources of the country, it was too bad to persist in wantonly extracting large sums from the pockets of the people, to support extravagant establishments. Let the right hon. gentleman look at the estimates for the year 1823, and then explain why, when sixty-eight thousand men were deemed a sufficient force for that year, an increase of twenty-three thousand men was deemed necessary for the present. Was there any mighty difference between the political circumstances of the country at that time and at the present? The colonies surely were not the cause of the great increase. If they were, then arose a very important question; namely, was the administration of those colonies such as it ought to be? Was the government at home doing every thing in its power to drive the colonies to desperation, or was it endeavouring to conciliate their affections by an attention to their wants and wishes? Why had we six thousand men at present in Canada? Why, but because we kept Canada like a garrison, under the control of a governor whom the inhabitants hated and despised? What would the country think if his majesty were to treat the House of Commons in the same manner as the governor of Canada had treated the House of Assembly of that colony? What would the country think if his majesty were to disapprove of a Speaker who had been elected by a large majority of the House of Commons? What would the country think, if, after fifty-five members had voted in favour of a certain individual as Speaker, and only four in opposition to him, his majesty were to turn round upon the majority and say, "You may elect him as long as you like, but I will never approve of him as your Speaker?" And yet this very outrage had been committed on the feelings of the House of Assembly by the present governor of the two Canadas. It had elected the same individual again and again as its Speaker, and again and again had its choice been disapproved of
<col>622</col>
by the governor. Was it this mode of treatment which rendered the continuance of so large a force in that colony a matter of necessity? He wished the House would compare the amount of the military establishment of the United States with that which our government now kept up in Canada. Strange as it might appear, the United States, immense as their territory was, did not maintain for their whole service so many troops as we kept up in the comparatively petty province of Canada. Was that a state of things which any man in his senses would pronounce to be right? If they were dissatisfied with the manner in which the Canadas were governed, had they a more cheering prospect before them when they looked to our other colonies? In every one of them a wretched system of misgovernment prevailed. The consequence was, that the people of England were burthened with large military establishments, in order to support the maladministration of the arbitrary military governors, which the administration at home sent out. He should be glad to see all these military governors displaced. He had no personal dislike to military men; but he wished to see them where they were always seen to the best advantage&#x2014;he meant at the head of their corps, who, like themselves were accustomed to the arbitrary command of military energy. Civilians could not bring themselves to submit to it with patience; and thus the sending out of military men as governors excited in the colonists feelings of dissatisfaction and disloyalty, created in their breasts an alienation from the interests of Great Britain, and rendered them willing to do any thing that tended to destroy the connexion between the two countries. This state of things imposed on the inhabitants of the mother country an enormous expenditure; and grinding taxation took large sums of money every day from their pockets, for no other purpose than to keep down the indignant spirit of our oppressed colonies.&#x2014;To return, however, to the estimates. He was sorry to see, that notwithstanding the large professions of economy made by the government, there was no palpable change in their amount. When he put the professions of the administration in one scale, and the heavy arguments against them&#x2014;he meant the millions of expenditure&#x2014;in the other, he had great misgivings in his own mind, that their professions would never be realized. The administra-

tion, however, now referred to something which it had done, as a proof that it intended to carry its promises into execution. And what was that something to which it referred? A committee. Here he would observe that, as far as he yet knew any thing of the committee which the House had recently appointed to inquire into the state of our finances, there was no cause to complain of it: he saw every thing about it fair and honourable, quite as much so as he wished it; and that, for him, was saying a great deal. At present the committee was seeking for information on the subjects into which it was to inquire; and it was only right to say that the right hon. gentlemen connected with the different departments of government had hitherto shown the utmost disposition to assist it in all points of its inquiry. But let the House consider the time which the committee must be employed before it could be in a condition to make a report on the subjects into which it was empowered to examine; and let it then decide, if it could, that it was incumbent, in the present state of our finances, to do nothing in the interim. Let hon. members compare the estimates for 1823 with those for the present year, and abstain, if they could, from calling on the right hon. Secretary to explain to them, why we should have a larger military force by twenty-two thousand men now, when Europe was at peace, than we had at a time when Spain was distracted by internal quarrels, and France was preparing to march her thousands into that country to put a stop to them. Under such circumstances, he could not help asking the right hon. Secretary, whether a relief from the burthens which pressed upon the country, ought not to be a measure immediately taken up by the government? If the House permitted the present military establishments to go on, one of two consequences must ensue&#x2014;either we must become a military government, or we must rob the creditor to pay the soldier. He did not say that we must become a military government, from any fear of the present head of the Treasury: he trusted that his good sense would enable him to see that our constitution was essentially a civil constitution, and that our military establishments had grown out of it; owing to the arduous struggle, no matter how it commenced, which we had had so long to maintain with our great rival, France. He
<col>624</col>
was afraid, however, that our finances would suffer severely, unless some decisive steps were immediately taken to improve them, and he therefore said, that the duke of Wellington might acquire greater honour by restoring them to their pristine vigour, than he had ever acquired by the trophies which he had won in war. The laurels which his grace had purchased by his achievements on the field of battle had already consigned him to an immortality of glory; but his grace might earn a fame even stilt more honourable, by achieving the more quiet but more lasting triumphs of peace. Let his grace turn his attention to the present state of the population, and view its sufferings, if it were possible, with an unmoved eye. One half of the inhabitants of the country were starving; crime and misery were covering the land with victims; and poverty and desolation were carrying their inroads into quarters hitherto impregnable to their attacks. Let his grace earn better laurels than any which have yet encircled his brow by converting a starving and dissatisfied into a well-fed and contented population. It was in his grace's power to accomplish so desirable a consummation, if he would only embrace the opportunity before him. Let him diminish the burthens which pressed upon the people&#x2014;let him relieve them from ten or eleven millions of the taxation which now ground them to the dust&#x2014;and then let him contemplate the result of so noble an experiment.&#x2014;He was aware that some individuals, who were very ingenious, and, notwithstanding, very absurd, were in the habit of saying, that all our distresses arose from the reduction of our expenditure, and that it would be much better for the country to increase than to diminish its establishments. If we could get money to pay for those establishments from other people, instead of taking it from the pockets of our own industrious artisans, it might be as these wiseacres represented; but we were not, like the Romans of old, supported by the wealth of tributary nations, and therefore could only maintain enormous establishments by the exhaustion of our own resources. Surely the reflection, that we were wringing the money to maintain such establishments from the earnings of industrious and indigent poor, ought to induce the government to pause in the career they were pursuing. Why should the man who laboured twelve hours in the day be robbed of one-half of his wages to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0320"/>
<col>625</col>
support an idle pomp, from which he derived no benefit? If his grace should but have the will, as he had the power, to put a stop to such a state of things, he would be the greatest of benefactors to his country.&#x2014;He begged pardon of the committee for having trespassed so long upon its attention, but he was firmly of opinion, that they were bound to do something immediately for the country, after the language in which they had been addressed that night by the right hon. Secretary. The right hon. Secretary had told them to wait until they received the report of the Finance Committee. He would advise them not to wait any longer, but to proceed forthwith to pare down the military force of the country to eighty thousand men. He trusted that, after the Finance Committee had made its report, they would be able to pare away another ten thousand from that number. He would move, as an amendment, "that instead of voting ninety-two thousand men for the service of the next six months, we only vote eighty thousand."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00448"><member>Sir J. Macdonald</member><membercontribution> said, that though he felt inclined to grant the supply which it was now proposed to make to his majesty, he was particularly anxious to guard himself against the supposition, that he agreed to it from any confidence in the present administration. So long as he saw men acting together in apparent concert, between whom an irreconcilable difference had recently existed,&#x2014;so long as one portion of the administration was sitting calmly by the side of another portion of it, though it had been charged by that other portion with the meanest and basest usage towards its Sovereign, and though those charges were still unrefuted&#x2014;so long as he saw a spectacle which placed the administration in so shameful and contemptible a light&#x2014;it was impossible that any vote which he might give should be a vote of confidence in that administration. He must say, that his noble friend had chosen an inconvenient mode of taking the discussion as to the number of men for the service of the year. The committee was not now discussing the amount of the sums to be expended for their support, because it was understood that a more suitable opportunity would arrive for that discussion. It appeared strange, that the committee should be called upon to agree to a vote for ninety thousand men, when the leading member of the administration
<col>626</col>
had told them, that he did not propose to saddle such a force, by five thousand men, upon the country for the ensuing year. It appeared strange, that after the government had come to such a conclusion, and that a hope was held out, that a still further reduction might be effected by the Finance Committee, that it should propose to the committee to insert ninety thousand, men, as the number which it would be expedient to vote for the next year. He could not allow the sarcasms which a right hon. gentleman had passed upon the speech of a worthy alderman to pass unnoticed. That speech was one of a manly character, conceived in a liberal and constitutional spirit, and was worthy the representative of a great commercial city. The right hon. gentleman appeared to have misunderstood much of the argument of the worthy alderman, when he complained of the conduct of government in referring the estimates to a committee. The complaint was, that the estimates were referred to a committee, instead of being settled by the administration on its own responsibility. As that complaint applied not only to the present administration, but to the last, for whose honour, he as a member of it, must feel a tender regard, he would inform the worthy alderman, that he joined issue with him. He was of opinion that government could never so efficaciously promote useful reforms as a committee honestly and fairly selected, and determined at all hazards to perform its duty. The right hon. gentleman had properly stated on a former night, that whenever any reductions were to be made in the different departments of the public service, the heads of those departments were always of opinion, that the other departments could bear reduction better than their own. There was, consequently, some difficulty, in making any reduction at all, when the head of the administration had to decide in which department the proposed reduction should be made. Hence he conceived, that it was much better to leave a committee up stairs, not only to decide what reductions should be made, but, in what departments they should take place. He thought that the late administration, determined as it was to carry into effect any recommendations which the Finance Committee might advise, had done wisely in leaving in its hands such powers as the worthy alderman complained of. But he was happy to inform the worthy alderman, that the late
<image src="S2V0018P0I0321"/>
<col>627</col>
administration did not leave the work of reduction entirely to the Finance Committee; for, if he would look at the estimates, he would see that they had reduced the expense, by so large a sum as 1,100,000<i>l.</i> He was not saying that in the present distressed state of the commerce of the country, a reduction of 1,100,000<i>l.</i> was such a reduction as the country ought to be satisfied with: it was, however, an earnest that the late administration really wished to reduce the public expenditure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00449"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to be allowed to explain upon two points. It had been asked why they should vote a given number of men for six months, when the number for the year must be recited in the Mutiny-bill; a recital which would form a conclusion against any subsequent alteration of it? Now, he begged leave to inform the committee, that the Mutiny-bill recited the number of men voted for the year, as a foundation for the code of laws by which the Crown governed the army in time of peace; but nobody ever supposed that by that recital the Crown was bound to keep up the number of men enumerated in it. The Mutiny-bill recited a greater number of men as being employed for the service of the year, than the Crown could ever bring into, or than ever were actually in, the realm. No difficulty, therefore, could occur upon that head; because, if the Crown should be inclined to disband the army entirely, it would not be prevented from doing so by the large number of men recited in the Mutiny-bill as being engaged for the year. It was consequently clear, that even though the House should agree to a vote for a given number of men for the year, and should insert that number in the Mutiny-bill, it would not thereby be prevented from afterwards reducing it to such a number as a committee might think proper to advise. The objection, therefore, that was started upon this ground, could not apply to the vote under discussion. He had been asked, what convenience the service would gain by having the Mutiny-bill passed for the whole year, instead of half a year. If any gentleman would look at the last clause of the Mutiny-bill, he would see that its continuance was limited to different times in different places, according to their distance from England. Now, if they broke all those periods into two, they would render that
<col>628</col>
clause still more complicated than it was at present. This would not be the case with the Marine Mutiny-bill, and for this reason; that the marines, in time of peace, were generally stationed at home. If, then, the course which he proposed left open the revision of the numbers for the year, just as if the grant had been for six months, he trusted that the committee would not object to it. The hon. member for Aberdeen evidently supposed that the vote had been for six months, and it was only at the moment that he was going to move his amendment that he found out his mistake. That circumstance showed how little he would have gained if he had proposed the vote for six months instead of twelve. The hon. member had complained, that he had made certain alterations in the constitution of the colonial corps. There was actually no possibility of pleasing the hon. member. If the government did not improve its old arrangements, the hon. member taunted it for its attachment to them; and if it threw the old arrangements into a better form, the hon. member taunted it with not having altered them sooner. That was a bad mode of encouraging public men to improve the system on which their predecessors in office had acted. The committee would see clearly the reason of the hon. member's dissatisfaction with these new arrangements&#x2014;they deprived him of his usual topics for a speech on the army estimates; a deprivation at which the committee would not, he believed, feel much regret, as the retrenchment of the hon. gentleman's speeches was one of the retrenchments which the House was particularly anxious to make [a laugh]. In defence of those arrangements he would merely observe, that it appeared better to him to place the military expenses of the colonies in one department of the estimates, and their civil expenses in another. The hon. member had stated his wish to have a reduction of ten thousand men now, and another reduction of ten thousand more at the end of six months, and so on until the army was reduced to the numbers which composed it in 1823. He had asked what reason there was for our maintaining a larger military force now than we did then? The hon. member ought to have recollected that the force of 1823 was a reduction from a much larger force which we had kept on foot in the years 1821 and 1822. The service of the different colonies
<image src="S2V0018P0I0322"/>
<col>629</col>
could not be carried on at a smaller amount of troops, without imposing such a degree of duty on the different regiments, as would not be fair in a time of peace. It was thus that the augmentation had gone on, not with a particular view to this or that particular colony, but upon the general principle, that there should be a disposable surplus of five thousand men, prepared for any exigency. He would appeal to the events of the last year or two to show that there was nothing unreasonable in that policy. Had government not acted upon that principle, it would have been impossible for this country to have gone to the aid of Portugal so speedily as she had done. It was not to keep down the population at home that such a force, or that any force, was required. Happily, the disposition of the people constituted a better guarantee for their tranquillity than the presence of any force, however formidable. He would state a case to show the hardship to which the service must be exposed, by limiting the number below the present amount. There were two regiments at that moment under orders for foreign service. They had each of them been six years on the home station. But then, at the time of their return home, six years ago, they had experienced seventeen years of uninterrupted foreign service, either in the East or West Indies, or at Ceylon. Was it necessary for him to say more, to show that we had not a greater disposable force than was required for the security of the colonies and the relief of the troops? But it was asked, why, if government were to determine on the reduction of five thousand men, they reduce by individuals, instead of proceeding at once to disband by battalions? He would answer, that government did not discharge a single man; they only abstained from recruiting to fill up the vacancies as they took place, and by this operation performed the business of reduction by insensible degrees, and with the least possible inconvenience. One of the advantages of this course was, that no pension was granted, as no man was discharged. It was true, that by the other system of disbanding by regiments, 20,000<i>l.</i> or 30,000<i>l.</i> might be saved; but was that any equivalent for the evil of crippling our defensive means, by destroying the skeletons of regiments? A new regiment was well known to be a very different thing from an addition to the skeleton of an old regiment. But
<col>630</col>
another and a more obvious effect of the disbanding of regiments would be to decrease the number of regiments, and consequently to increase the amount and burthen of duty upon those who remained. The period of foreign service, must, in that case, be prolonged, and the period of home service diminished. He was sure that the House would not think 20,000<i>l.</i> or 30,000<i>l.</i> a-year well gained by the imposition of such hardship on the military force of the country. He would only add, that he was ready either to discuss the amount required at the present moment, or, as he would certainly prefer, to postpone that discussion to a period of the session, when they would be better enabled to look at the subject in all its bearings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00450"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> said, he could not understand why, taking a vote for six months, it should be objected to take, at the same time, a Mutiny-bill for six months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00451"><member>Mr. P. Thomson</member><membercontribution> expressed an anxiety to have some guarantee from the noble lord, ensuring the House not only that they were not pledged to any specific number of troops by the vote required, but that there was a disposition on the part of government to reduce the number as low as possible. It was too much the habit of government to refer them, upon all questions of economy to the Finance Committee; but they were bound to take care that between the two stools the public did not come to the ground. The Colonial Secretary, and the Secretary at War, seemed to differ as to the functions of that committee. One thought it had nothing to do with the naval and military establishments, the other that it had. All he would say was, that if it had nothing to do with these establishments, he did not see why the noble lord should refer them to that committee. At all events, he hoped that as they were called upon for a vote, they would have an understanding from the noble lord, that there should be a diminution of expense, instead of the increase which they were justified in apprehending. They were told by the noble lord, that there was to be a reduction of five thousand men; but he was sorry to say that such assurances afforded him little consolation. The House would recollect, that they were told of great reductions in the half pay and pension lists before; and they would also recollect how far those promises had been realized. Were the half-pay and the pensions reduced? On the contrary, had
<image src="S2V0018P0I0323"/>
<col>631</col>
they not been increased? Not, he would admit, in the last year as compared with the year before, but in each of the succeeding years as compared with the year in which the pledge was given. The noble lord seemed at a loss to know how the military establishment could be reduced. He would answer him in the words of his hon. friend&#x2014;"pacify Ireland, quiet Canada:" to which he would add "make your colonies pay for their own defence, or abandon them." The noble lord had stated, that England did not require troops to protect herself, but her colonies. Upon that understanding, he supposed Ireland might be considered a colony; and certainly she was as misgoverned as any of them. This fact seemed to point out the remedy,&#x2014;that of changing the system of government under which expensive establishments were required. If that were done, they might then look forward to better times.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00452"><member>Colonel Davies</member><membercontribution> said, that the noble lord had instanced the case of two regiments now under orders for foreign service, which had passed but six years at home after having served abroad for seventeen. This case was intended to show, that the army did not admit of any reduction. But what would become of the noble lord's argument if it could be shown that such instances grew out of a system new to the army,&#x2014;the system of d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t companies; and that they must continue to arise so long as that system was persevered in? Those establishments consisted of eleven thousand four hundred and twenty four rank and file, which were rendered totally inefficient by being scattered about in small detachments, and stationed in places where they were not wanted. The consequence was, that the battalions were frittered down to a small number; and thence arose the necessity of greater and more rapid demands for foreign service. Military men were all agreed, that nothing could be more. injurious to the service. As to the noble lord's plan of reducing by individuals, not by battalions, he would ask, was it necessary to have a hundred and twenty battalions as a nucleus from which to recruit our army in the event of war? The plan adopted during the last war must be admitted to have worked well; and that was to reduce, whenever reductions were made, by battalions. Independently of the testimony of experience in its favour, there was this manifest advantage,&#x2014;that it
<col>632</col>
allowed the country to get rid of the staff, while it increased the efficient force of the army. For these reasons, he was decidedly of opinion, that the system of retrenchment might be further applied than the noble lord seemed disposed to carry it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00453"><member>Mr. Monck</member><membercontribution> said, that in the few words he should offer, he would confine himself exclusively to the dead-weight; under which head there were some items that seemed to call for examination. He was aware that in that House the example of America was not likely to find admirers; upon which account he would make no appeal to the system pursued in the American army; but the example of France was not regarded with the same jealousy or repugnance. The government of France was more monarchical, but, happily for her people, less aristocratical than our own. The power of the Crown might be less restrained, but the interests of the people were more consulted. To the practice of the French army he therefore would appeal. The first point he should notice in the regulations of the French army was, that their system admitted of no such thing as the retiring of officers upon full pay. Yet no man could doubt of the efficiency of the French army. Another article in the deadweight, was the pensions granted to officers' widows, which amounted to no less a sum than 143,000<i>l.</i> It was, he believed, only within these few years, that pensions became uniformly granted to the widows of officers. In former times, they used to be granted only in particular cases, and with certain conditions, and the widow was obliged to declare that she did not receive double the amount of the pension from any other source. Every man must wish to see, not only the officers' widows provided for, but their children, and, if possible, their children's children. But the French had contrived a method of providing for the widows without casting the burthen on the people. There was a regulation in the French army, that no officer should marry without first making a settlement on his wife, in proportion to the amount of his pay. He should be glad to know, why the same system might not be adopted in our own service. With what face could we read lectures to the poor on the guilt of improvident marriages, while we held out a bounty to officers to contract marriages without regard to the same consideration. If officers' widows were to be pensioned, was there not as much reason
<image src="S2V0018P0I0324"/>
<col>633</col>
for pensioning the widow of the common soldier? Nothing should be done retrospectively, but much might be done prospectively, for the alleviation of our burthens by attending to the example of France. Supposing the English army to be placed upon the same footing with that of France, a saving of 621,000<i>l.</i> would be the immediate consequence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00454"><member>Sir H. Vivian</member><membercontribution> said, that the regiments which were raised at the commencement of the war were at first inefficient, in consequence of the want of skeleton regiments to graft them on; though they quickly became efficient afterwards. He did not hesitate to express his opinion, that if in 1793 a larger and better disciplined force had been sent out to the continent, the war would not have been prolonged, nor the expense incurred have been so excessive. The hon. gentleman who spoke last, did not wish too see the widows who now, held pensions deprived of them; but the country would not, he was sure, wish, either now or at any future time, to see the widows of officers, who had served and bled for their country, deprived of the miserable pittance which the humanity and justice of that country had provided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00455"><member>Mr. A. Dawson</member><membercontribution> compared the conduct of parliament in voting away sums without investigating its means of payment, to that of a private gentleman, who proceeded to arrange his establishment, without considering whether he was capable of bearing the expense. He maintained that if a Sinking-fund of five millions was to be kept up, the country could not support its present establishments, and defray the amount of its taxation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00456"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that the noble lord had greatly mistaken his words, if he supposed that he had complained of his having turned into the right way. For his own part, though he was willing to give the noble lord credit whenever he went right, he was determined never to cease to blame him for having gone wrong so long. The present system ought not to be continued. As it was, every 100,000<i>l.</i> of stock purchased by government was at a loss of fifteen or twenty per cent. He was sorry to hear the right hon. gentleman talk of the saving made by the buying up of stock through the means of Exchequer-bills. The right hon. gentleman, in calculating the saving, only looked at these bills during half their progress, He should wait until the bills were funded, before he spoke of
<col>634</col>
a saving. In fact, many of those bills were funded at a loss of forty per cent. He hoped the new ministry would put an end to such expensive absurdities. He trusted that the hon. gentleman (Mr. Calcraft), who had such confidence in them, would urge them to the good work. He entertained but little hope that the reduction to the extent of ten thousand men would be now effected, while a military chief presided at the head of the cabinet. He was anxious, however, to put the question fairly before the country, and to show that no reason, at the present moment, existed against such a reduction. Did gentlemen wish to see Ireland tranquillized? Let them effect a reduction of thirty thousand men in their military establishment, and ministers would make the people of Ireland friends, instead of keeping them down as foes. As long as a great military force was maintained in that country&#x2014;as long as Ireland was like Jamaica, a garrisoned colony&#x2014;so long the people would continue discontented. The country called for a reduction in the army, and there existed no reason why that reduction should not be effected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00457"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> said, the hon. member was in error in charging him with inconsistency on the subject of the Sinking fund. He was not an advocate of paying off the debt with a Sinking fund, while there existed no real surplus from which it could be taken. But as the law stood, they must find money to keep it up, as well as every other establishment. He could not but hail the maiden ignorance exhibited by the new lords of the Treasury on this subject as a happy omen. Those three gentlemen stood unpledged to all ancient fallacies, and when the Finance Committee met, they would be ready to give their support to a new and improved system. He was glad that the new lords of the Treasury were not implicated in the support of lord Bexley's delusions. He expected much from the duke of Wellington. He was sincerely impressed with the conviction, that there was no man more likely to make a reform in the expenditure of the country, with the exception of one noble friend of his, than the present head of the government. Objections had been raised to the present as being a military government. That was perfect nonsense. He was sure the duke would not allow his military character to interfere with the discharge of his civil duties.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ORDNANCE ESTIMATES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00459"><member>Sir H. Hardinge</member><membercontribution> said, that in calling upon the House to vote the Ordnance Estimates for the current year, he had to state, that no new works had been introduced into them. They were precisely such as had been already sanctioned by the House, and he now merely asked for a vote of credit to meet the expenditure of the Ordnance department for the current year. Whenever the report of the Finance Committee should come under the consideration of the House, all the details of this department would be open for investigation and discussion, and the present vote would not pledge any member to a particular line of conduct then. He now moved, "that a sum not exceeding 783,598<i>l.</i> be granted on account of the Ordnance department for the year 1828."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00460"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> did not rise to oppose the vote. If an army of ninety thousand men were to be maintained, he did not see how a further reduction could be effected in the Ordnance. He would reserve to a future period the expression of his sentiments upon this subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00461"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> said, that for the three or four years during which the duke of Wellington was at the head of this department, he had entered into a minute investigation of its various details, and it was his impression that his grace had made as much reduction in it as the public service would admit of. Now that the noble duke was at the head of all the departments of the state, it was reasonable to conclude that he would enforce a system of economy similar to that which he had established while presiding over the Ordnance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00462"><member>Sir H. Hardinge</member><membercontribution> said, that since the year 1820, when the Ordnance department was confided to the duke of Wellington, to the year 1827, when he gave it up, a saving had been effected of no less than 230,000<i>l.</i> Indeed, when other expenses which had been curtailed were taken into consideration, the saving might be stated at 300,000<i>l.</i> a year. It had been effected, not by a diminution of the military expenditure, but principally of the civil establishment. In one instance two hundred and forty clerks had been discharged, and a saving of 147,000<i>l.</i> effected. While this saving was thus produced, he could
<col>636</col>
show that the military works had been increased by about seven hundred men, and that other portions of the department had been rendered more effective than they were in 1820.<lb/>
The resolutions were agreed to, and the House resumed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION&#x2014;MINISTERIAL EXPLANATIONS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00463">On the motion that the House do adjourn,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00464"><member>The Marquis of Clanricarde</member><membercontribution> said, he was sorry again to intrude upon their lordships' attention, but as there was no public business immediately about to come under the consideration of the House, he trusted he might be allowed to say a few words with respect to a contradiction, or a partial contradiction, which had been given, in another place, to what he had stated to their lordships on a former occasion. He had then stated, that a declaration had been made by a right hon. gentleman (Mr. Huskisson), whom he conceived to be a particular friend of his lamented relation; and he had asked the noble earl opposite (Dudley), whether he had not heard that declaration, and whether he did not concur in it, and know to whom it referred. The right hon. gentleman had, however, stated at Liverpool, that, as to personal enemies of Mr. Canning, he knew of none. In comparing that statement with the declaration which he had made to their lordships, he had no wish to make it a matter of charge against the right hon. gentleman he alluded to, that he had departed from that declaration: he only asked for an explanation of the obvious contrast which those two statements presented; and he believed he had not been clearly understood by the noble earl opposite, who did not reply to his question, otherwise than by eloquently descanting upon the virtues of forgiveness, and alluding to the conduct of his lamented father-in-law, under circumstances which he could never allow to be similar, in any point, to those in which the right hon. Secretary of State for the Colonies and the noble earl were intermixed. As, however, he had put his questions only a short time previous to the adjournment of the House, when several noble lords were leaving their places, and when the noise which was made rendered the conversation
<image src="S2V0018P0I0326"/>
<col>637</col>
inaudible, at the desire of the noble earl he I re-put those questions; and if he understood rightly, the noble earl admitted that he had heard some such declaration; but though the noble earl might not approve of the feelings which had caused that declaration, and might not give it the sanction of his name, yet he did not think it was to be considered without limitation as to time. Though there was a very great difference between the declaration which he (lord Clanricarde) had stated to their lordships to have been made, and that which had been personally admitted by the noble earl, and the declaration which was avowed to have been made in another place, yet he must contend, though that avowal and the declaration which had been admitted was a sufficient proof of the inconsistency of the statement made at Liverpool, that at least the right hon. gentleman did know, in December last, of some personal enemies to Mr. Canning, though by the lapse of time which ensued between that month and January, he had forgotten the existence of any of them. As to the truth of what he had stated to their lordships, it rested on unquestionable authority. On his return from the continent, the right hon. Secretary of State for the Colonies made more than one visit to the widow of his lamented relative. He could not state the exact day that, on going to the house of that lady, he met the hon. gentleman just at the moment he had left. He entered, and was immediately informed by his noble relative, and by another person, to whom the subject was no less interesting; that the right hon. gentleman had to each of them made a declaration, in the terms which he had stated to their lordships. What the right hon. gentleman had said at Liverpool he did not think it important to repeat in their lordships' house. But when he saw the contradiction, at first the most direct and flat, but afterwards much qualified, which had been given to that declaration, when he saw that contradiction, qualified as it was, he must own that he was truly astonished. He clearly held in his memory every minute particular, attendant on the circumstances, under which he, for the first time, learned that such a denial had been made; and he doubted whether his ears or his memory had not proved treacherous to him; and he determined, that if on investigation it should prove to be the case that such denial had been
<col>638</col>
made, he would seize the first opportunity of avowing to their lordships his feelings on the subject. He therefore referred to the individuals on whom he placed the greatest reliance, before he ventured to address their lordships, and he found their recollection so perfect and undeviating in every particular, that there did not exist on his mind the shadow of a doubt with respect to what the individual of whom he was speaking had stated. He now held in his hand, a letter, written by the noble lady (lady Canning) on Friday last, to whom he had been obliged to allude, in which she distinctly asserted, that that individual had made a declaration such as he had reported to their lordships. He should not think it necessary to read the letter, unless he was called upon so to do; in which case, he had the authority of that noble lady to make such use of it as he thought proper. It had been stated, that that declaration could not be made public without a scandalous violation of confidence. When the communication had been made to him, he never considered it as confidential: it was never desired that it should be so considered: there was nothing in its nature which could give it that character. The declaration had been communicated to others of the same opinion with himself, and several weeks ago it had appeared&#x2014;not exactly in the same words as he had described it&#x2014;in a daily journal of the widest circulation, to which, it was clear, that it had not been communicated by his (lord Clanricarde's) friends, from the circumstance that there also appeared in the same paper the answer which had been given to the declaration when it had been first uttered; which answer was not known to his friends, until it had appeared in the public prints. It had been made a matter of accusation against him, that he had brought forward this question in a place where the right hon. gentleman to whom it related could not answer. But he humbly asked their lordships, where was he to remark upon the conduct of a minister, and upon a speech which he had made in a place to which it was irregular in him to allude, but which had been uttered in the face of the country, and upon an occasion of the deepest importance,&#x2014;where was he to observe upon these matters if not in their lordships' house? It had been a matter of sincere and painful regret to him, that in discussing these subjects, he had been unavoidably placed
<image src="S2V0018P0I0327"/>
<col>639</col>
in apparent hostility to the right hon. gentleman, upon whose conduct he had made some remarks; but he felt it his duty not to allow the statements or representations made at Liverpool to pass without contradiction. Having thus far experienced the indulgence of the House in speaking of matters of a personal nature, he would not trespass further on their lordships' attention than by stating, that though the interval and lapse of time comprised in the short space of four months had not obliterated in his mind, as it had in that of others, the remembrance of his lamented relation, yet, so far from allowing his feelings to place him in direct opposition to the government, he sincerely hoped that the measures which might be brought forward would be such as he could conscientiously and cordially support. But, when he reflected on the tone of disrespect which had been taken by some of the members of the present government, and the obloquy which had been cast by others on the name of that individual, to the support of whose principles he looked for the welfare of the country, he could not give the present ad ministration a cordial support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00465"><member>Earl Dudley</member><membercontribution> confessed himself under great difficulty in entering at all into the consideration of the question&#x2014;if any question had been put at all&#x2014;which the noble lord, for the second time, had thought fit to bring before their lordships, giving no other notice to any individual whom the question might concern, than such as might be collected from clubs and newspapers. It appeared to him, that the subject which had been brought under their lordships' attention was not of a nature to be discussed in parliament. Parliament ought to judge of public men on public grounds and public declarations; but it was not the province of parliament to inquire whether particular individuals, who had been the friends of Mr. Canning, had conducted themselves with proper delicacy, in accepting places or continuing in office with those persons, between whom and that individual any unfriendly feeling had grown up. The noble lord had stated that he had put a question on a former evening, relative to a declaration which had been made by his right hon. friend, a member of the other House of Parliament, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The noble lord did ask a question, as to that declaration, and as to his joining in office with those persons who had express-
<col>640</col>
ed themselves in so hostile a manner towards Mr. Canning. He had then told the noble lord all he knew on the subject of that declaration. He had told him, that, at the time of the formation of the new government, after the death of Mr. Canning, he perfectly understood that a declaration had been made by Mr. Huskisson, that, with the feelings he entertained at that time, he was not disposed to act with those who had opposed themselves to Mr. Canning. That was all he knew of the matter. He had no reason to think that the declaration was of such a nature as to be considered as affecting the conduct of the right hon. gentleman at a future period, or under other circumstances. He would not dilate on the moral reasons which should induce men not to cherish feelings of eternal animosity; but, in a political view, he thought that in a country like this, it would be impossible for a government to go on, if expressions used in the warmth of political animosity and party struggle were to be considered as binding upon men for ever. The history of this country, and of every other free country, was a history of political animosities and quarrels, and also of political reconciliations; and that, too, when the quarrel had been of much longer duration than that which had taken place at a late period. What was the nature of that quarrel? It was this&#x2014;that after Mr. Canning had acted, for several years, with those persons who had retired from office, when he was called upon to form a new administration, circumstances arose, which alienated from him persons with whom he had formerly acted, and with whom he proposed to act again; and that unfortunate difference continued to the end of his life. It continued only for a few months, after years of friendship, union, and co-operation. He thought, however, that this question was one which could not be discussed with any public advantage, for he could not think that discussion to be a proper one for their lordships, which referred to private papers and to reports, necessarily very uncertain, of conversations which had taken place between individuals, and which were, after all, points with which the public, strictly speaking, had nothing at all to do. Society was the tribunal before which matters like these ought to be judged; they were related by no means to topics which ought to be introduced to the notice of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00466"><member>The Marquisof Clanricarde</member><membercontribution> observed, that it was necessary for him to show that the statement which he had formerly made upon this subject was accurate. This was all he intended to do. His proposition was a very fair one. The right hon. gentleman (Mr. Huskisson) made a certain declaration respecting the enemies of Mr. Canning; and at Liverpool he had said, that "of personal enemies to Mr. Canning he knew of none." Now, was this correct? It was not, as the noble lord appeared to think, a declaration made only to persons with whom he was connected; nor was it because the declaration had been made there that he adverted to it. The right hon. gentleman had been reported, in the public papers, to have used certain expressions at Liverpool. Now, if he did use those expressions at Liverpool, he used in parliament&#x2014;he was going to say, different ones, but he would not say "different," because his question had not yet been answered&#x2014;to whom did the right hon. gentleman make the declaration to which he referred? He must again observe, that his veracity had been impeached; that an imputation had been cast upon him; and it was necessary for him to show that there was no ground for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00467"><member>Lord Seaford</member><membercontribution> rose and said:&#x2014;My lords; it is impossible for me, without feelings of the most painful nature, to enter into the discussion of a subject, which involves a question of the sacred performance of the duty of friendship, to a friend who is now no more; a friend, whose friendship was the pride and delight of my life, from our earliest youth, till the disastrous moment when he was snatched away&#x2014;though in the fulness of fame and honour, yet most prematurely for the happiness of his friends, and the good of his country. Those feelings are so painful as only to be overcome by a paramount sense of duty; and they have been rendered still more distressing, by the course pursued by my noble friend (lord Clanricarde). The near connection in which he stood to Mr. Canning, and by which he is still united to those who were most dear to him, renders it most painful to me to express a difference of opinion from him upon points in which we have both so deep an interest, and the reluctance which I felt to do any thing which might have the appearance of unnecessarily entering into a conflict with him sealed my lips on a former occasion, and prevented my taking a part in that de-
<col>642</col>
bate; nor will I now enter upon the several points which my noble friend has brought forward, but shall content myself with making that statement which I conceive to be due to my noble friend opposite (lord Dudley) and those other friends of Mr. Canning, who form a part of the present administration.<lb/>
Having, my lords, had an opportunity of witnessing the habits of friendship and confidence which subsisted between my noble friend opposite, and Mr. Canning, and knowing the admiration, I may say, the veneration, which my noble friend entertained for Mr. Canning's transcendent talents, and for those, if possible, still more endearing and fascinating qualities which he possessed; having been acquainted also with the circumstances under which my noble friend accepted the seals of office which he now holds&#x2014;circumstances affording no ordinary proof of friendship on his part, and of confidence on the part of Mr. Canning&#x2014;I cannot believe it possible that my noble friend was influenced, in the course which he took, by any other feelings than those of a sincere and genuine sense of what he owed to the memory of his friend. It is impossible, also, for me, my lords, to entertain any other opinion with respect to the feelings which influenced the course taken by my right hon. friend the Secretary for the Colonies.<lb/>
Having, my lords, had an opportunity of estimating Mr. Huskisson's attachment to Mr. Canning, during a period of not less than twenty years of constant political concert and uninterrupted habits of private friendship, it is impossible for me to doubt the feelings under which Mr. Huskisson has acted in accepting office; and when I see my noble friend opposite, and that right hon. gentleman, made the object of hostile attacks&#x2014;not only those of fair parliamentary hostility, but of other sorts more difficult to be dealt with&#x2014;I feel that I should not be acting a manly and honourable part towards them, if I was to shrink from declaring my opinion, and claiming my share in whatever obloquy their conduct has excited.<lb/>
I am unwilling to dwell upon those attacks to which I have adverted; but there is one topic which my duty to Mr. Huskisson compels me to notice. I am well aware how ill suited such topics are, to the gravity of your lordships' discussions, but the subject having been brought before your lordships by my noble friend (lord
<image src="S2V0018P0I0329"/>
<col>643</col>
Clanricarde) and having been made the subject of debate in another place, I must take the liberty of troubling your lordships with one or two observations upon this point, and I trust that my motives for doing so will be my excuse with your lordships. I mean, my lords, the attacks made on Mr. Huskisson, in consequence of a declaration understood to have been made by him in the highest quarter. Mr. Huskisson has publicly avowed that declaration in parliament; but an attempt was made to discredit the accuracy of that avowal, and to fix upon him other expressions upon the authority of other persons.<lb/>
To the difference between the two versions of that declaration I attach no importance; but to the inference attempted to be drawn from their difference to his prejudice; which is no less than this, that he now professes to have used expressions which he did not employ upon the occasion, and that he disavows those which he did employ. To this, I do attach importance; and as my name has been brought forward in support of this attempt, I feel it to be due to Mr. Huskisson to declare, that on no occasion when I may have mentioned that declaration, did I mention it in a manner which could justify the attempt to fix upon Mr. Huskisson any precise form of expression, upon my authority. I never professed to give the precise words which he had used on that occasion; I attended only to the substance; and I cannot now pretend to rely upon the accuracy of my recollection, as to the precise words which I may myself have used, certainly, not in contradiction to the recollection of any friend to whom I may have made the communication; but if I did use those words that have been attributed to me, I am bound to state, that I have had a subsequent opportunity of knowing that they could not have been the words which were used by Mr. Huskisson, and I take no blame to myself for this inaccuracy in my recollection, in consideration of the manner in which I originally received the information. In a conversation at Paris with lord Granville, on the subject of this declaration, lord Granville showed me a letter written to him by Mr. Huskisson, on the day after the declaration had been made, consequently, while the impression was fresh upon his mind. In that letter he relates confidentially to lord Granville what had passed, and he does so in the same words which
<col>644</col>
he has lately avowed in another place. Those persons know me very ill, if there are any who imagine, that by what I now state, I wish to soften down or qualify the sentiment, which dictated that declaration. It would be disingenuous in me if I were not to avow, and I trust the noble duke will do justice to the motives which dictate the avowal, that some of the transactions which took place on the formation of Mr. Canning's administration, and subsequently to that period, did excite feelings in my mind, and have left an impression, which would have rendered it very difficult (I do not know how difficult) for me to have formed a political connection with those of Mr. Canning's colleagues, who separated themselves from him on that occasion. But, my lords, I speak as a private individual, and with feelings which apply peculiarly, perhaps, to my particular situation. My noble friend and Mr. Huskisson are public men; they had public duties to perform, public duties to their country and to their friend; and when they received the overture from the noble duke, they were bound to consider well, what were the obligations which those duties imposed upon them, and I cannot but approve of their having acted in conformity to their conscientious sense of those duties. If, my lords, the explanation received by my noble friend, were as full and satisfactory as he has stated them to have been, and as I doubt not, and if the assurances received by my right hon. friend, were such as to satisfy his mind, that in forming a part of the noble duke's administration, he should not be called upon to abandon the principles which he had always espoused, and which had been acted upon by Mr. Canning&#x2014;then, I say, that I think it was their duty not to withhold their services from their country. I think also, that their private duty dictated the same course. The noble duke's offer to them of retaining the important offices which they then held&#x2014;departments of no slight importance, embracing no less than the administration of the foreign, colonial, and commercial, policy, and the local government of Ireland&#x2014;without requiring of them any abandonment of their principles;&#x2014;this offer of the noble duke I cannot but consider a tribute of respect so honourable to the memory of Mr. Canning, that his friends would not have been justified in rejecting it on grounds merely personal. My lords, if I
<image src="S2V0018P0I0330"/>
<col>645</col>
hold thus high&#x2014;as I do most high&#x2014;the homage thus paid to the memory of Mr. Canning, I mean nothing disparaging to the noble duke, I see nothing in the proposition of the noble duke, or in the explanations with which it was accompanied on his part, or on that of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Peel) with whom Mr. Huskisson also communicated on this occasion, which the strictest sense of honour might not have dictated. They had both acted as colleagues with Mr. Canning, not only in the ad ministration of lord Liverpool, but in that of the duke of Portland, at the commencement of their own political career, when my late right hon. friend filled the office of Foreign Secretary; they were both of them approving and concurring parties to every measure, by which his administration of the foreign departments has been distinguished under the government of lord Liverpool.<lb/>
My lords, as the measures of Mr. Canning's foreign policy have been the subject of much discussion and criticism, I trust I shall be excused if I cannot persuade myself to pass over those criticisms altogether without notice. Some noble lords have objected to the principles of Mr. Canning's foreign policy; others have admitted the soundness of his principles, but have refused to him any merit on that score, and have found fault with the execution; others have disapproved both his principles, and their execution; others, again, have declared that they did not know what were his principles of foreign policy. To these various, and some of them contradictory, criticisms, I will not make any detailed reply; nor will I pretend to submit to your lordships an abstract exposition of Mr. Canning's principles, I will content myself with a general and short, but as I conceive a conclusive, answer, by a reference to these practical results&#x2014;to the situation, in which Mr. Canning left this country, when he was snatched away from the direction of her councils. He left her at the head of the councils of Europe; in that proud station which her power and importance among the nations of the world justly entitled her to assume; the luminary by which every cabinet directed their course, if not the guide they were content to follow&#x0021; The eyes of all the nations of the new, and the old world, fixed upon her, with gratitude by many, with hope by others, with respect by all. For the fidelity of this picture, I
<col>646</col>
appeal to the testimony of every Englishman who has travelled in foreign countries&#x2014;who has witnessed the universal respect entertained by the liberal and enlightened of all countries, for the principles and policy of the government of this country.<lb/>
I appeal to the stronger but melancholy testimony of the sensation of dismay and consternation, which was felt at his death, which was mourned scarcely less as a public than as a national calamity. It is no disparagement to the noble duke or to the right hon. gentleman to whom 1 have referred (Mr. Peel), to be said to have been approving and concurring parties to policy of which such were the fruits. The right hon. gentleman at the head of the home office has, indeed, declared, on more than one occasion, and he has lately repeated the declaration, in a manner which reflected the highest credit on his candour, that, with the exception of the Catholic question, there was not any important measure on which he did not concur with Mr. Canning; that there was no one with whom he could have acted more satisfactorily as a colleague, no one under whom he would have been better content to serve as his leader in too House of Commons; or even at the head of the administration, if it had not been for the particular situation in which they each stood with respect to the Catholic question, and the peculiar relation of the department which he held with the person at the head of the government. With respect to any differences of opinion, such as have been rumoured to have existed, on some measures of Mr. Canning's foreign administration, between him and the noble duke, it is not within the competency of any person not in his majesty's councils to express any opinion, or to have any knowledge of such differences, or of any discussions which may have taken place on any such measures, previous to the decision by the cabinet; but it is not too much to assume, that they could not have been such as to make any difference on fundamental principles, or any incompatibility of acting together as colleagues. That no such incompatibility was felt by Mr. Canning was proved, at the time when he received the king's commands to submit to his majesty the plan of an administration, by his offer to the noble duke, and the rest of his colleagues, to retain the situations which they then held, accompanied with the assurance, that the government should continue to be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0331"/>
<col>647</col>
conducted on the principles of that of lord Liverpool, and, as far as his wish went, that it should be composed of the same individuals. I see, then, no great inconsistency, under similar circumstances, in a similar offer being made by the noble duke to Mr. Canning's friends, or being accepted by them; no objection at least arising out of any incompatibility in their political principles, or any important differences of opinion, or any great measures of government. As to any objections arising from private feelings, I have already stated why I think they might and ought to be subordinate to a sense of public duty. But, notwithstanding the experience of the noble duke and Mr. Canning having acted together as colleagues, and the degree of concurrence of their principles which is thence to be inferred, and notwithstanding the explanations which have taken place as to any differences of opinion which might have arisen since the noble duke and Mr. Canning had ceased to act together as colleagues, there are some noble lords who are of opinion, that some stipulations, or pledges, or guarantees, ought to have been demanded by my noble and right hon. friends, the Secretaries for the Foreign Affairs and for the Colonies. I must confess that I entirely differ from that opinion. For them to have required any such guarantee would, in my opinion, have been worse than unnecessary; and I heard without surprise, and with entire concurrence, the noble duke's assertion, that it was impossible for Mr. Huskisson to have used the words attributed to him in the papers; indeed, I knew that he had not used them; for I had seen him on the day after his return from Liverpool, when I asked him whether the reports of his speech were in that respect correct: he said that he had seen no report of his speech but that in the Liverpool Courier. I then referred to a London paper, when he declared that report to be incorrect, and explained to me the sense in which he had used the words, exactly as he explained them afterwards in his place. In that sense I conceive them to have been correct. For I cannot suspect the noble duke of making an offer to men of honour to retain their offices, meaning afterwards to call upon them to abandon the principles on which they had previously administered them, even if no explanation had taken place; after the explanations which took place, I consider it to be impossible,
<col>648</col>
and I will not argue an impossible case. But to those who can entertain any such distrust I will shortly answer, that should such a case arise, my noble friend and his colleagues would always have the remedy in their own hands; namely, the power of retiring from office; nor can I entertain a doubt of their having recourse to that remedy without a moment's hesitation, rather than submit to any compromise of their principles, any more than I can suspect the noble duke of intending to drive them to that necessity.<lb/>
Upon these grounds, my lords, I am disposed confidently to expect that the noble duke's administration will be conducted upon principles in conformity to those which I have always supported, during the long period that my political course was united with that of Mr. Canning; nor, until I see some practical sign of a disposition to depart from those principles, will I withdraw my confidence, or anticipate the probability of its being disappointed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00468"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> said, he did not rise with the intention of entering at any length into this discussion, which, in his opinion, was entirely uncalled-for, and might as well have been left alone; or of making any profession of principles, because he thought that unnecessary, and because he hoped, after what had fallen from the noble lord, that he would support the principles on which he (the duke) should act. But he rose to protest against any such imputations being cast upon him, as that he had entertained any personal hostility to Mr. Canning. On a former occasion, he had stated distinctly to their lordships, why he did not think proper to remain in the government of which Mr. Canning was the head. The communications that had passed between him and Mr. Canning had, unfortunately, he must be allowed to say, been made public; and he defied any man to point out any thing like personal feeling in those communications. It was true, that, when he found it necessary to withdraw from the government, he had also thought it his duty to lay down the military office which he held; but he begged leave to call their lordships' recollection to the explanation which he had given at that time, and to his subsequent conduct. After he had left the government, he had always met Mr. Canning in the way in which he had been accustomed to meet
<image src="S2V0018P0I0332"/>
<col>649</col>
him, and had not departed from those habits of friendship which had marked their previous intercourse. But he would go further. He had no hostility towards Mr. Canning's government. He had, it was true, proposed that a clause should be added to the corn-bill; but had he not, at the same time, begged of the government to adopt that clause, or something like it, and not to abandon the bill? He must repeat, that to the day of his death, he had felt no personal hostility towards Mr. Canning; and that Mr. Canning was equally free from the imputation of having entertained any political hostility towards him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00469"><member>Lord Melross</member><membercontribution> said, he agreed in every syllable that had fallen from lord Seaford, and could not let that opportunity pass without declaring himself satisfied with the conduct of Mr. Canning's friends.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IMPERIAL GAS COMPANY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00471">The Report of this bill was brought up. On the motion, that the amendments made by the committee be read a second time,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00472"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> opposed the bill, on the ground that the company had not complied with the provisions of the bill which they had obtained in a former session. By that bill they had agreed, whenever a dividend was made, that one-eighth of such profits should be invested in government security, until the sum so obtained should have accumulated to 250,000<i>l.</i>, which was to be funded for the purpose of meeting all legal demands against the company. This arrangement had been shamefully departed from, and the company had the front, notwithstanding, to come to parliament for the purpose of acquiring an increase of power, and an extension of their funds. This company possessed an advantage over all other gas companies, as each member was liable only to the amount of the share he had adventured, whereas others incurred the risk of their entire fortunes. On these grounds he moved, that the report be read on that day six months. He opposed the bill on public motives, not knowing any thing of the parties concerned, but by their past conduct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00473"><member>Mr. G. Robinson</member><membercontribution> seconded the amendment. The directors of this company, instead of vesting in the public funds one-
<col>650</col>
eighth of their annual dividends for the public security, as required by a clause in their bill, had, he said, taken care to keep the whole in their own funds. Now, would parliament consent to grant to this company additional privileges, when the directors had not complied with that clause in the bill? He was the more opposed to it, because he found among the directors and managers many names which figured in the concoction of the Arigna Mining Company, and various other fraudulent schemes. He hoped that the House would not concur in the report, as the directors had proved themselves unworthy of confidence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00474"><member>Mr. Clinton</member><membercontribution> hoped the House would examine the amendments recommended by this report, before they adopted the course now suggested. He admitted that the dividends had not been applied as required by the act; and it was to provide a remedy for that misapplication, that these clauses were now offered by the committee. If the directors should hereafter dispose of the one-eighth of the dividends otherwise than as directed by the bill, they would be subjected to a penalty of 500<i>l.</i> each. Another clause called upon the directors to lay their accounts annually before parliament. The only additional power that these amendments in the act was to give the company was the power of raising 150,000<i>l.</i> to enable the directors to carry the provisions of the former act into effect. The company lighted all the north-west of the metropolis, extending over several miles of turnpike-road; and their finances were insufficient for that purpose. He knew nothing of the company until the present session; and had now come forward because the hon. gentleman who had obtained the former acts was not now a member.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00475"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> thought it would be highly improper to trust those who had already abused the confidence of the public, and set at nought the acts of the legislature. The hon. member, who spoke last, confessed that the company had been guilty of flagrant abuses. This was now the third time of their coming to that House for purposes of aggrandizement. On the first occasion they had obtained 250,000<i>l.</i> on the understanding that a contingent fund should be established. On the second application they received 250,000<i>l.</i> more, although the condition had proved a dead letter; and they now came a third time for an additional
<image src="S2V0018P0I0333"/>
<col>651</col>
150,000<i>l.</i>; and still there was no contingent fund. He thought the company had gained exceedingly by the change of support in that House; for, if this bill had been brought in by the hon. gentleman who had brought in the former bill, no man in the House would support it, as that hon. member (Mr. Peter Moore) was known to have concocted many of these fraudulent schemes. He hoped the bill would not be allowed to proceed any further. Instead of granting new powers, parliament ought to repeal the former act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00476"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, that the fact of a connexion with the Arigna Mining Company, and those other public cheats which had so materially injured the community, together with the admission, by the chairman of the committee, that abuses had been practised for so considerable a period, were fully sufficient to warrant their rejection of the present demand. Seeing that the company had so grossly abused their trust for the sake of emolument, the House ought not to listen to any proposal which had for its object any addition to their finances. Even if the bill were in itself a desirable measure, he would not consent to enlarge the powers of the company.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00477"><member>Mr. Maberly</member><membercontribution> opposed the second reading of the report. The company enjoyed, he said, a charter which gave them a great monopoly; and they had endeavoured to make that monopoly still greater, by evading the condition's with which they were bound to comply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00478">The House divided: For the original motion 6; For the amendment 75. The bill was consequently lost.</p>

<title>LANDLORD AND TENANT (IRELAND)<lb/> BILL.]</title><p id="S2V0018P0-00479"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> presented a Petition, signed by the principal noblemen and leading Roman Catholics of Ireland, complaining oft he operation, and praying a modification, of the Landlord and Tenant bill, which had recently passed into a law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00480"><member>Lord Milton</member><membercontribution> expressed a hope that, whatever alterations it might be found necessary to make in the details, the House would not lose sight of the principle of the measure, as it was calculated to produce the most beneficial effects in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00481"><member>Mr. Brownlow</member><membercontribution> also defended the principle of the bill, and contended, that it was calculated to put an end to the great evils produced by the pernicious practice of sub-
<col>652</col>
letting land in Ireland. In consequence of the present system, the occupying tenant was often distrained three times, through the insolvency of the superior landlords through whom he held the land. These evils were of daily occurrence, and could not be borne patiently. The number of the people made them dangerous, and tyranny and poverty would render them formidable. These were the weapons before which, in the event of the present system urging them to despair, must ultimately fall the wealth, the education, and the greatness, of this country. By the present mode of government, instead of the people of Ireland being united in love and affection, a spirit of hostility was introduced between them. Let the parliament of this country yield the Catholic question, and they would hear nothing more about the management of property; but until that measure was conceded, its refusal would aggravate the amount of every grievance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00482"><member>Mr. G. Dawson</member><membercontribution> observed, that he felt it his duty to say a few words on the injustice of a petition, which had for its object the making a complaint against that part of the law known by the name of the Subletting Act in Ireland. When that act was about to be brought into parliament, the nature of its enactments were carefully made known throughout Ireland. No objection was made to it; and it was not until other circumstances had called up the Catholics in opposition to the act, that one word had been said about its supposed evils. The present petition was not from the landlords or tenantry of Ireland, but from the Catholic Association. There was hardly the name of one occupying tenant affixed to it; and he would venture to say that it was the petition of the real oppressors of Ireland&#x2014;he meant her middlemen. In proof of this he would read from it a sentence, in which would be found words to this effect&#x2014;" Can you, we ask with all deference and respect&#x2014;can a Christian legislature contemplate two millions of murders, without horror and affright? We know that they are Irishmen, and poor Irishmen, but is not their blood of price in the sight of the Almighty." He would not comment further on such expressions; but he would ask whether, if the sentiments contained in the petition were those of the tenantry of Ireland, the table of the House would not have been crowded with them before now? The truth was, that the tenantry of Ireland were protected by this
<image src="S2V0018P0I0334"/>
<col>653</col>
act; and while that protection was afforded them, he trusted the House would not be carried away by warmth of language, but would stay for proof of injury, before they made up their minds to condemn an act which had been so long in operation without complaint. This act afforded the only remedy against the miseries which the system of subletting had introduced. Instead of Ireland being a garden, as it ought to be, it was any thing but a garden: and instead of exhibiting that high degree of cultivation which it ought, its agriculture was in a state that was a reproach to any country calling itself agricultural. He did not mean to say that the bill was faultless; but he recommended the House to adhere to its principle, and to introduce such amendments as might appear necessary in its details. With such amendments it would be one of the greatest benefits they could confer upon Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00483"><member>Mr. North</member><membercontribution> approved of the principle of the bill, and thought there was not one man who really felt for the evils of Ireland that did not approve of it. He did not concur with all its provisions, as they at present stood. He thought the clause which provided that a tenant who possessed land under a lease should be precluded from devising his farm to more than one person ought to be repealed, as it compelled the testator either to sacrifice his children, and vest the property exclusively in his wife, or to mark out one favourite child to the exclusion of the wife and of the other sons and daughters. He thought, too, that some limitation of the periods of time mentioned in the act ought to be provided; and that the guardian of an infant or lunatic should be empowered to give his consent to an assignment proposed by the tenant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00484"><member>Mr. F. Lewis</member><membercontribution> was also in favour of the principle of the bill, the tendency of which, he thought, was to assimilate tenures of land in Ireland to those in England. In consequence of the dissimilarity which now existed in these tenures, the appearance of the land in Ireland was very different from that in England. The same difference existed between the appearance of the men and of their habitations; and whoever had passed through Ireland, must have remarked the want of those comfortable homesteads which distinguished the counties of England. It had been said, that the grievance of Ireland
<col>654</col>
was non-residence; and the best remedy was, he thought, to create a numerous, honest, and independent body of occupying tenantry. The grievance of non-residence existed equally in Wales; but the great difference between Wales and Ireland was, that the former possessed a respectable body of occupying tenantry, of which the latter was in want. Though, in the reign of James, the operation of gavelkind tenures was put an end to by parliament, yet that tenure still, in fact, existed in the leases of Ireland. He appealed to the House, whether the attempt to intimidate them by the picture of the miseries of Ireland, and of their consequences, was calculated to produce a beneficial effect. He knew it had been said in a distinguished speech, delivered in a certain place, that the Catholics of Ireland had risen in strength, like the Jews of old; but he trusted no such language would be repeated, with the vain idea of intimidation. Let the House steadily adopt measures tending to improve the condition of the tenantry of Ireland&#x2014;to secure them from that worst of all misfortunes, that of being driven for rent, when their rent had already been paid; and then, whatever might be the other evils of Ireland, the House would have done much towards lessening their effects.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00485"><member>Mr. R. Colborne</member><membercontribution> suggested that the discussion had already gone far enough, as they would soon have an opportunity of debating the question when it came properly before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00486"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, from what had fallen from his right hon. friend, the Irish Secretary, the other night, he seemed to be prepared to submit a proposition, for the amendment of this bill, to their consideration. Under these circumstances, the best course would be, to wait until the proposed amendment came distinctly before them. He would not more immediately refer to the terms of the petition, or to the object of those who presented it, than by saying, that the most dignified revenge the House could adopt was, to pass such amendments as they conceived would afford the best remedy to the evils that were admitted to be in the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00487"><member>Mr. H. Grattan</member><membercontribution> thought that if members passed over the petition, without attempting to protect the petitioners from the effects of the bill, they would not discharge their duty. He differed from the hon. member who proposed to apply the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0335"/>
<col>655</col>
same laws to the two countries; and he objected to the act, as he thought it was passed against the interests of the tenant, whose property was rendered almost valueless by the impossibility of assignment. He denied that the petition had originated with the Catholic Association, as he had last session presented several petitions from landholders to a similar effect.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NAVY ESTIMATES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00489">The House having resolved into a committee, to which these Estimates were referred,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00490"><member>Sir G. Clerk</member><membercontribution> said, that as future and fitter opportunities would occur, he should not go into any detail of the items. At present it was proposed only to take half the sum that would probably be required for the service of the year. He moved, "that the sum of 2,208,233<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>. 9&#x00BD; <i>d</i>. be granted to his majesty on account, towards defraying the Naval Service of the year 1828."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00491"><member>Sir J. Yorke</member><membercontribution> said, that although he was one of those who were anxious to shorten the debates of that House, he was not altogether at his ease, when he saw that his hon. friend intended to shorten into a single vote a discussion which had often occupied the House more than a whole night. He conceived that there were items in/the present estimates, which the Committee of Finance ought to treat in a very inquisitorial manner, and which, if they did so treat, were certain to be reduced considerably. It was stated, the other night, by the Secretary to the Ordnance, that the duke of Wellington had made considerable reductions in that department of the public service, and that by those reductions he had not only increased its utility, but had stimulated the zeal of those who were employed in it. He trusted that similar reductions would be speedily made in the naval department, with similar benefit to the public service. He should like to know why his hon. friend below him, who had so often played first fiddle on occasions like the present, and the music of whose voice he was happy to hear again from his former situation, had again come forward to propose these votes, instead of his hon. and gallant friend (sir G. Cockburn), who had been first appointed to propose them. He wanted to hear from his hon. and gallant friend, what reductions were meditated at the Admiralty. He was afraid that we
<col>656</col>
were at present between two stools, and that, what with the Finance Committee on the one hand, and what with the Government on the other, we should be in a pretty state before long. He wished to ask his hon. and gallant friend, what quantity of shipping it was determined to keep in actual force. He saw that there was 800,000<i>l.</i> to be voted this year for timber alone. He was sure that that grant might be very considerably reduced. We had, at present, one hundred and ten sail of the line building and in ordinary. Did government intend to keep up the whole of that force? Now, when he looked at the estimates for 1792, and again at the estimates for 1828, there did appear to him a mystery which it would be difficult to unravel. In 1792, we had 414 ships of all classes; and in 1828 we had 504. In 1792 the number of officers and shipkeepers were 4,224; and in 1828, 2,780. Indeed, it was impossible to look at these estimates, as compared with those of 1792, without seeing the wide difference in the expense of the men; 2,780 men cost at one time 105,815<i>l.</i>, while at another 4,224 cost only 93,000<i>l.</i> He earnestly hoped the Finance Committee would look close at these things; and particularly at the cost of the manufacture of shipping. He was not a man to war against authority, and he therefore looked, not to the lord high admiral, but to the council who advised him; and if they gave his royal highness evil advice, we betide the executive. He was not in the House the other evening when his gallant friend had alluded to the fifty thousand seamen's jackets which had been turned up. These were charged 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to the seamen, and the taking them back left the country <i>minus</i> the Lord knew what. The council had advised his royal highness to get rid of these jackets, and the Navy-office had flung the business from their Atlean shoulders upon the feebler back of the Victualling-board. On these fifty thousand jackets, there was, perhaps, a loss of 10<i>s</i>. upon each, which made a good round sum. But, "Oh," said his gallant friend, "we have taken the seamen out of the hand of the Jews: the poor tars were previously in the habit of going to these infernal fellows, the Hebrew Jews." Into whose hands, then, had he put them? Why, he had taken them from the Jews to deliver them over to the Gentiles; for the Victualling-office was to charge them 24<i>s</i>. for
<image src="S2V0018P0I0336"/>
<col>657</col>
these jackets. Thus, when a fine athletic sailor came on board, scrub him well was the first thing to be done, then put proper clothing on his back, taking care, however, that his debt to the government for these slops should be squared, so that he did not owe as much as would make it worth his while to run away. There was nothing so capricious as this system of clothing. Officers knew not, from day to day, how far they were safe in the official pattern of their uniforms. By arithmetic a man might cast up his accounts, and know how he stood; but there was no arithmetic to gauge the clothing for the circle of a man's person, to regulate the rotundity of an admiral's belly, as compared with the sparer shape of a midshipman's. Lately they had done away with the whole cut of the naval uniform, and for no purpose upon earth that he could understand. Why, it was only last summer, that at the very best dinner he had ever sat, Mr. Speaker's, he (sir Joseph) was complimented as the best-dressed man in the room. The compliment came from his rev. friend, the Speaker's chaplain. For forty years had he been in his majesty's naval service, and improvement after improvement, as it had been called, had been made in the pattern of his coat, until it had been reduced to what they now saw, with hardly a skirt upon it. Their coats were now reduced to trumpery jackets of the most extraordinary appearance. It might be convenient for the service to shorten the jackets, because it was not always fine weather; but was it equally convenient for the pocket? There was the rub. How long was this little jacket to last? Would his gallant friend, in the language of the famous Liverpool speech, give him a guarantee that this uniform would last a twelvemonth? Would he say it would not be penal to wear it at the end of the year? He hoped the Finance Committee would look to this particular grievance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00492"><member>Sir G. Cockburn</member><membercontribution> said, that, after his extraordinary speech, he could not help complaining of his gallant friend's not being in his place on the occasion to which he had referred, as he had thought proper in so loose a manner to quote the proceedings. His gallant friend had no right to put words into his mouth which he had never uttered, for the sake of answering them in his own way. What he had really said was, that an order had been given for a better description of jackets,
<col>658</col>
but not for fifty thousand; and that, after experience of their quality, it had been deemed advisable, when a large stock was on hand, to reduce the amount to three months supply, and the rest were sold. The charge to the seamen was 11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., the cost price being 9<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The loss was not of such importance to the public, as to induce the Admiralty to continue the sale of these jackets, especially as the seamen would so much the sooner, after they were discontinued, obtain a comfortable suit. He had said that the jacket now sold was of a much better kind at the same price; but he had said, also, that as it was desirable to place the best kind within the reach of the seamen, the best that could be made were sold to them at 24<i>s</i>., the same as were commonly selling at the ports for 40<i>s</i>. and 50<i>s</i>. The Finance Committee were going into all the points connected with the expenditure of the navy. He had been twice before the committee, and he could state that they did not seem inclined to suffer any thing to pass unnoticed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00493"><member>Sir Joseph Yorke</member><membercontribution> said, he was quite surprised that the government, in the manufacture of the Finance Committee, had not put upon it one, or two, or three professional men, connected with the navy, army, and ordnance, who could unravel the matters connected with their departments with technical dexterity. Upon it, however, there was not a single great gun; no, not even a pistol, or a patterero.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00494"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, he could not help expressing his astonishment that the House should be called upon to agree to votes on account, without any statement being before them, or any one point marked out in which some reduction was to take place in the expenditure. That he considered to be the proper time for a member of that House to take into his consideration any and all the acts of government into which he deemed it right to inquire, and to demand something like a pledge from them, before he intrusted them with the disposal of large sums of money which might be spent, as it appeared, on their own shewing, that former grants had been, wastefully and extravagantly. It was rather a matter of surprise, that an hon. gentleman should, by way of passing a high encomium on a noble duke, have stated that a considerable effort had been made in the Board of Ordnance, to facilitate economy. The gallant officer
<image src="S2V0018P0I0337"/>
<col>659</col>
had stated, the other evening, that a saving of 300,000<i>l</i>. yearly had been effected, and two hundred and forty clerks discharged. Now, he considered that this statement involved the most serious charge ever brought against any set of individuals concerned in the management of public affairs. It was obvious, on the face of, it, that a scandalous waste of the public money, to the extent of 300,000<i>l.</i> a year, had been continued for many years, and that two hundred and forty useless clerks had been retained in the public service when they were of no use to it; for the gallant officer had gone on to say, that every thing was, since this reduction, as effective and complete as before. The House had a most important duty to perform. They had been told, that they had nothing to do with establishments, nor with the question of peace or war; that it was their duty simply to give money for the wants of the government. That, then, was the only time, when the supplies were under consideration, to decide whether they would restrain or repress the extravagance of the men who held, the public purse. He, for one, objected to the voting of any money until the Finance Committee had done something satisfactory in explaining the mode in which the public affairs were conducted.&#x2014;He begged the attention of the House to the facts which he was about to state. They were not charges against the present administration or the last, but against all the administrations and all the persons who, during the last fourteen or fifteen years, had been concerned in the management of public affairs. The other evening he had stated, on the authority of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Peel), that there had been expended, during the last four years, an excess of nine millions and a half beyond the revenue of the country. Now, the House knew that every year when his majesty addressed his faithful Commons from the Throne, he always told them he had ordered the estimates to be prepared with every attention to economy. He would, however, ask the House whether it could be possible that ministers had paid all due attention to economy&#x2014;whether they had not, in fact, put a falsehood into his majesty's mouth, in order to delude that House&#x2014;when they made him say so; as it now turned out, on their own confession, that in one single branch of expenditure they had wastefully spent
<col>660</col>
300.000<i>l</i>. a year, and kept two hundred and forty useless clerks? How could the members of that House agree to suspend their functions, and suffer government to delude their constituents, by throwing every thing on the Finance Committee? He had as much confidence in that committee as any member. He believed they would honestly discharge their duties; but that was no reason why he should not also do his duty. No member could transfer his responsibility to any body else. The right hon. gentleman had taken him to task, the other evening, for not having known better than to introduce, what he called, extraneous matter on this question. But he would contend, that this was the proper occasion. If the right hon. gentleman turned to the speeches of Mr. Pitt, he would find that there was not a single point he now urged, which had not been maintained by that minister. The House had been told that it would be much better to leave the consideration of these affairs altogether to the Finance Committee. So it would be infinitely better, he agreed, for the government, if all were kept out of sight of the public, and talked over only in the committee. Had not the House had professions of economy enough? Yet, had they not seen that the expenditure was not lowered? This session they had voted thirty thousand seamen. Lord Castlereagh, in 1817, had reduced the number to eighteen thousand. They had voted ninety-one thousand men for the army. Not a single man had been reduced in either service. The right hon. gentleman had stated a most extraordinary fact in his recent speech on the finances of the country. He had admitted, that there was a deficiency of eight millions. If the Dead-weight was included, the deficiency would be thirteen millions. How was this to be supplied? Government would not reduce the expenditure: they left all that to the Finance Committee. By act of parliament they were bound to support the Sinking-fund. How, then, he asked again, was the deficiency to be supplied? Did ministers mean to raise money by a loan, or by new taxes? What means had they but by one or other of those courses? They told the House that they would protect the public creditor. So would he; but that could only be effectually done by raising money by taxes, or reducing the public expenditure. Without new taxes, or a reduction of the public expenditure
<image src="S2V0018P0I0338"/>
<col>661</col>
the interest of the debt could not be paid. He had taken the pains to look into the expenditure of 1817, in order to contrast it with that of the present year. That year was rather an unquiet one. There were Spafields meetings, and various other disorders calculated, in the view of government, to create alarm; yet that very year lord Castlereagh stated, that the government would only want seventeen or eighteen millions; which he afterwards reduced, by deducting the expenditure of a former year, to about thirteen millions. If the expenditure since 1823 had not exceeded that of 1817, there would have been a saving, compared with what it really had been, of nine and a half millions. If the expenditure had been regulated according to the statement of the Finance Committee of that year, or that of lord Castlereagh, the saving from 1817 to the present year would have been within a fraction of twenty-five millions. Taking the expenditure at thirteen millions, the sum saved would be sixty-five millions. He called on the House to give its most serious attention to this subject. Had they ever touched the estimates? Had they ever cut down a single item? Had not ministers defended them, and insisted that they were reduced to the lowest pitch? His Hon. friend (Mr. Hume) had endeavoured in vain to effect the saving of 5,000<i>l</i>. here, and 10,000<i>l</i>. there, even in that very branch of the Ordnance in which such great reductions had been effected. But ministers had always resisted every economical proposition; and now they asked for the confidence of the House, and assured it how very saving they were going to become; while they admitted that they had been justifying the most extravagant waste, to the amount of 300,000<i>l.</i> in one department, in which two hundred and forty clerks had been kept of no use to the public. That House was of no use if it was merely to sit, and, by its acquiescence, give a colour to the acts of the ministry. Lord Somers had said, that "parliament was the great inquest of the whole kingdom, to search into all oppression and injustice on the part of the king's ministers." Had that House done so? Had they, in a single instance, thwarted the minister, excepting in the case of the Property-tax? That was the only instance, and let the House mark what followed&#x2014;an immediate reduction of expenditure. If the House
<col>662</col>
would, in the same manner, reduce the revenue, government would find means to reduce the expenditure. The House had it all in their own power. They might do it in a moment by a stroke of the pen, by withholding the supplies. It was for the House to say what burthen the country should bear, and for the government to make reductions in their establishments accordingly. The Finance Committee could not judge of items, but the individuals at the head of the departments could easily decide on the reforms they would effect; and after the important discovery of this saving of 300,000<i>l.</i> a year in the Ordnance, the House would be criminal if they suffered a single shilling to be voted on account, thereby confiding in ministers who had so greatly abused the trust reposed in them. They should compel ministers to come down with their plans of reform at once, and leave the House to judge how far they deemed them effectual. Lord Castlereagh did not throw every thing on the committee. He brought down a set of lowered estimates. If ministers wanted to know how the public money could be saved, it was easy to point out to them where reductions might be effected. They might get rid of two or three thousand cavalry, and they might cut down ten or twelve thousand seamen. Only a few years ago the number of seamen was reduced to fourteen thousand. Surely eighteen thousand seamen and one thousand marines would be fully adequate to the wants of the public service now. Government had gone on increasing the expenditure year after year. They had laid on one hundred millions of taxes since the peace, and nothing had been done towards the reduction of the debt; for the Sinking-fund had been aptly compared, on high authority, to the attempt of a wooden-legged man to catch a hare. The country borrowed at sixty or seventy, and paid at eighty or ninety. No greater farce or delusion was ever practised. If there was a surplus of revenue it would be wisely so applied, and a surplus there would be, if the public affairs were managed with common economy. He hoped the committee would examine minutely into the establishments, and if ministers were not prepared to defer the estimates until there had been an opportunity to revise them, he would oppose any grant on account.</membercontribution></p>

<col>663</col>
tion he felt in joining with the gallant admiral (sir J. Yorke) his surprise, that no person connected with the navy, army, or ordnance, had been placed on the Finance Committee. He had looked into the estimates of 1792, relative to the navy, and those for the present year; and he held it to be a great injustice to make a comparison between them. He would go back to the year 1792, when he was serving in the East Indies. The squadron then was nearly equal in force to that now employed on duty there, though this country had then a smaller interest to protect. The squadron had only to watch over the two sides of the Peninsula, and not quite the whole of them; as there were some places on the coast in possession of other European nations. This country had since acquired immense possessions in that part of the world. We had now not only to guard the Peninsula, but to send a part of our force into the Straits of Malacca and the Persian Gulph after the pirates, both of which places we never visited in 1792. Besides these, we had the Mauritius and the Cape of Good Hope to attend to. The service of the navy was now five-fold, nay ten-fold, greater than it was in 1792. No fair comparison could be drawn, therefore, between the estimates of 1792 and the present year. The House knew, also, that there was the whole service of South America, and of North America, too, which had considerably increased on account of the growth of the navy of the United States. Even in Europe, though the navy of Spain was destroyed, yet every body was aware of the rise of a new naval force in Russia, more effective than any that Spain had ever had. There were sufficient reasons for keeping tip the service of the navy in a fit state to meet emergencies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00496"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he could assure his gallant friend that, in the formation of the Finance Committee, nothing was further from his intention than to imply the slightest disrespect to the army or navy, by omitting the names of members of either service in the list of that committee. He could likewise assure him, that, so far from such a circumstance contributing to prevent the committee from turning its attention to the details of both services, since its appointment two distinguished military officers, members of that House, had been examined before the committee at great length upon all the points to
<col>664</col>
which reference had just been made. In forming the committee, it was necessary to select its members from persons connected with England, Scotland, and Ireland, and when the smallness of its number was considered, it would be perceived that it was by no means easy to place upon it all those members who had turned their attention to finance, and whose assistance could scarcely be dispensed with. It was the limitation as to numbers which prevented the introduction of any members of the army or navy on the committee. But every military and naval man could attend the committee, and lay before it whatever information it was in their power to communicate.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARMY ESTIMATES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00498">On the Order of the day for receiving the Report of the Committee upon the Army Estimates being read,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00499"><member>Sir John Brydges</member><membercontribution> said, that before the report was brought up, he believed he should not be irregular in saying a few words upon that subject. He had hoped, when the provisional grants for the different branches of the public service were passed the other evening, including that for the yeomanry-corps, that some hon. member would have taken the opportunity to have done that justice to them which they were so fully entitled to; but that not having been the case, he should trouble the House shortly upon the subject. Instead of offering any objection to the vote proposed on that head, he had to express his regret, that it was not to a greater extent. It had been his intention to have submitted a motion to that House having for its object the consideration of the measure of certain corps of yeomanry-cavalry having been recently disbanded by his majesty's late ministers; but, understanding that it was in the contemplation of the present government to make some alteration in that establishment, he had declined to fulfil his intentions. He felt, however, he should be guilty of a dereliction of duty, if he suffered that grant to pass, without shortly bringing the services of those corps to the grateful recollection of that House and of the country at large. He did not desire unnecessarily to impugn the conduct of his majesty's late ministers&#x0021; They were, happily, defunct, and peace be to their manes: all he should apply to them was the epitaph on sir John Van-

<quote>"Lay heavy on him, Earth; for he</quote>
<quote>Laid many a heavy load on thee."</quote>
Neither would he take up the time of the House in eulogising that establishment, whose loyalty, and efficient services, on all occasions, for more than a quarter of a century, were beyond all praise; but the cold and ungracious manner in which a portion of it had been dismissed called upon him to bear this public testimony to their great deserts. Economy was urged as the motive for their reduction: but this economy, he said, was false: it was being penny wise and pound foolish. For how could so cheap, and so constitutional a force be obtained by any other means? Disband the yeomanry, and the standing army (that never-ceasing subject of vituperation with the Opposition) must be augmented for home service; whereas these corps, composed of the brave yeomanry of the land, the independent country gentlemen, and the nobility of the realm, were always ready, and had been so for thirty years, at considerable personal expense and inconvenience to themselves, and at little charge to the state, to leave their homes, and to forego their private interests, for the public good. He concluded with expressing an earnest hope, that some more gratifying and more suitable acknowledgment than the paltry grant to the Staff only, of such as had been disbanded, would be extended to those who already had been, or who might hereafter be, released from the service, and that it would never fail to be registered in the recollection of a grateful country, that although it had not been the fortune of these corps to earn Waterloo laurels, they had proved themselves the patriotic protectors of their altars and their homes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00500"><member>Mr. S. Rice</member><membercontribution> said, he could answer for the noble marquis, lately at the head of the Home Department, that in reducing the yeomanry corps, nothing was further from his intention than to cast the slightest reflection upon any one individual connected with them, or to manifest an indifference to the services which those corps had rendered to the public. The government felt grateful to the yeomanry forces for its past services; but there was an extent beyond which that feeling should not be carried. The extent of service rendered by that force bore no comparison with the
<col>666</col>
expense which its maintenance cost the country; and the late administration felt that the public at large ought not to be taxed for the support of such a force, because in certain districts, and in certain times, services had been performed by it. Would it be said, because a particular portion of the yeomanry, on a particular occasion, had discharged their duty, that therefore the public should be burthened with the expense of the entire body? It was a principle of economy which animated the late administration in carrying this reduction into effect. But before the hon. member cast his censure so unsparingly upon the late government on account of this measure, he would request him to inquire how many members of the present government would be included in that censure. Because certain corps had been efficient in certain districts, was that a reason that those corps which were perfectly useless should be maintained at the public expense? For several years, the yeomanry corps in the county of Devon had cost annually 14,000<i>l.</i> and during the last ten years they had never upon any one occasion been required to afford their aid to the civil power. This was a sample of the system which the hon. gentleman would support, and these were the forces for the reduction of which he so freely lavished his censure upon the late administration. The reduction of the yeomanry corps was effected by the late administration, because it did not look forward to exist as a government of force&#x2014;because it did not desire to be a government of military strength&#x2014;but because it depended upon its measures and its regard to the principles of economy, for its claim to the public support. By the late reduction a saving of two-thirds of the charges for the yeomanry corps had been made. Those corps which had proved themselves a really efficient and useful force had not been reduced. He was confident that this reduction would meet with the approbation of the House; and the opinion of the country, with the exception of a few persons who were pleased with the amusements of soldiery, and whose personal vanity was mixed up with the establishment of yeomanry corps, had been already pronounced in favour of the measure, as one of great utility, and from which no detriment could arise to the public service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00501"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> said, that with him the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0341"/>
<col>667</col>
only question was, why the dismissal of the yeomanry had so long been delayed? In 1817, he had propounded the same idea; and as he was connected with a regiment in Staffordshire, he trusted the House would give him credit for the purity of his motives. If there was any thing wanting to convince him of the good intentions of the late government, he should find it in the fact, that they had not regarded their own private feeling in favour of the yeomanry, when they deemed themselves called upon by public duty to dismiss the body.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00502"><member>Sir R. Heron</member><membercontribution> thought that the only question to be asked was, why the whole body had not been dismissed? He could not see that any portion of them was necessary. In time of peace they were utterly useless, nay, they were worse than useless; for, from proofs of their acts, the painful particulars of which he would not bring to the recollection of the House, they had shewn how unsafe it was to employ them, and how much more preferably the regular soldiery might have been engaged to undertake the business. For his part, he thought they ought to have been abolished ten years ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00503"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, he did not see how the present topic was connected with the question before the House, but he was quite prepared to take the fullest responsibility upon himself for the measure. It had been a saving to the country of 86,000<i>l</i>. a year, and that, too, without the sacrifice of any thing that was necessary to the well-being of the state. As to those corps which were retained, he thought that in that particular the noble marquis had exercised a sound discretion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00504"><member>Lord Morpeth</member><membercontribution> observed, that the hon. baronet had compared the late government to sir John Vanbrugh; nor did he object to that comparison, for he was quite willing that they, as sir John had been, should be the envy of the superficial, and the abuse of the ignorant; confident that they would inherit the well-founded admiration of posterity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00505"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that upon every occasion, the yeomanry had distinguished itself for the public good. It had always merited and received the approbation of the country; and the same disposition still pervaded the body at large to contribute its exertions whenever necessary in future. He was justified in saying so by the fact, that many corps had tendered
<col>668</col>
their services without any pay whatever, whenever they might be called upon; and he was confident that if the public service required their assistance, they would be found ready to come forward to devote their best efforts to its maintenance and support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00506">On the question being put, "That ninety-one thousand and seventy-five men be maintained for the service of the United Kingdom for the year 1828," Mr. Alderman Waithman moved, that the number of men be reduced to eighty-one thousand and seventy-five.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00507"><member>Mr. N. Calvert</member><membercontribution> thought that, as long as Ireland was in the state in which she was at present, the army could not be safely reduced. It was beginning at the wrong end to think of reducing the army: they should rather seek for some way to tranquillize Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00508"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> rose to explain why, upon this occasion, for the first time he believed, he should vote against reduction. They were at present only called upon to vote the estimates for six months, which were absolutely necessary, and nothing which passed now pledged any member to a particular line of conduct hereafter. He trusted that, in the Finance Committee, they should be able to reduce the military establishment of the country. In the existing state of their foreign relations, he did not think that the force specified in these estimates was too much to be granted to ministers for a period of six months [hear].</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00509"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, the House was called upon to make every effort to reduce the expenditure of the country. He should not, however, press his amendment to a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00510"><member>Mr. Sykes</member><membercontribution> did not see any reason why reduction should be postponed, on account of the appointment of the Finance Committee. When that committee should make its report, the session would probably be near its close, the members would be out of town, and, under such circumstances, parliament would be called on to discuss this most important question. He was unwilling to vote so large a number of men as ninety-one thousand. Such a force was not required in time of peace. They had not such a force in 1792, nor in 1817, nor even in 1823. He could not see what were the peculiar circumstances of the country which rendered such an enormous force at present necessary. Looking at
<image src="S2V0018P0I0342"/>
<col>669</col>
the difference between the expenditure of the country and its resources, he felt himself imperatively called on to vote for the reduction of the army; and for that reduction he certainly should vote, again and again, whenever it was proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00511"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that, in the peculiar circumstances of the country, it would be only a delusion to hold out a hope that much relief could be obtained by reducing the army. This was a mere fallacy; and there was another which had gone abroad, namely, that by reducing the expenditure in other respects, great benefit might accrue to the nation. The total annual expenditure was about fifty millions, and of this there were not more than nineteen or twenty millions for the army, navy, ordnance, &amp;c.; any reduction, therefore, that could possibly be made of these twenty millions of expenses, could not make a material difference, or meet the expectations of the public. The largest part of their expenditure was that which was connected with the interest of the national debt; and until they could reduce that, with perfect justice to the public creditor, it was clear that they could not make such a reduction as would satisfy the nation. Taking this point into consideration, it was, he conceived, very hard to expect from the labours of the Finance Committee that which they could not effect. He believed that the committee would prove to be an honest and efficient body; and nothing, he was sure, would prevent them from entering into a full investigation of every subject that might be brought before them; but it was unfair to expect impossibilities from them.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EAST RETFORD DISFRANCHISEMENT<lb/> BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00513">The order of the day for the second reading of this bill being read,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00514"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> said, that at that late hour, and having in the last session occupied so much time on the subject of this bill, he should not, in moving the second reading, say more than was necessary to remind the House of the grounds on which it rested, and to explain the course he intended to pursue. Members would recollect that the committee appointed last year to try the merits of the East Retford Election petition, had presented a special report, in addition to that, by which they announced to the House that the election
<col>670</col>
was void for treating. That special report stated, that it had been a "notorious, long-continued, and general, practice, for the electors, who voted for the successful candidates, to receive twenty guineas from each of them, so that the burgesses who voted for both the members returned, had customarily received forty guineas for such exercise of their franchise." In directing the attention of members to this report in the last session, he had touched upon the unparalleled extent of treating and the outrageous rioting at the last election&#x2014;rioting which could only be subdued by a military force. However repugnant to the constitution and to the law such interference might be, the paramount necessity for it in this case had been such, that the committee had determined a petition complaining of it to be frivolous and vexatious. He had thus exemplified the depraved, disordered, and demoralized, condition of the borough, the electors of which consisted of about two hundred persons&#x2014;one half-resident and the other non-resident&#x2014;all of them in the most abject condition of life. As to the main charge in the special report, he had so far satisfied the House by a statement of the evidence, of the existence of the practice complained of, and of its tendency to vitiate and corrupt the choice of the members, that the House had not only allowed him to bring in the bill now again before it, but it seemed to be its general impression, that any evidence beyond that taken on oath before the committee was unnecessary, and he believed that if the session had not closed upon him, he should have been allowed to pass the bill through that House upon the grounds which the minutes of that evidence afforded. Those details were however probably forgotten&#x2014;the impression produced was worn away&#x2014;and he now found several gentlemen so desirous of evidence at the bar, that if the House would read the bill a second time, he should propose to examine evidence in a committee of the whole House upon the bill, in order to justify that part of it by which it was proposed to disfranchise East Retford. He abstained from saying a single word as to any other of the provisions of the bill; because as they were all necessarily dependant upon the course which the House should take as to the first, it would be premature to enter into any discussion with regard to the expediency of giving the franchise to Birming-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0343"/>
<col>671</col>
ham or elsewhere until that first proposition was disposed of. The place to which two representatives should be given if Retford were disfranchised&#x2014;the nature of the elective franchise to be established in such new borough&#x2014;and all other subsidiary provisions, would be proper subjects for discussion in the committee, when he should be prepared to state the grounds upon which he thought Birmingham ought to be preferred, and, if he could not prevail on the House to agree with him, to submit to any alternative it might please to adopt.&#x2014;In confining himself, then, to that part of the bill which related to Retford, he understood an objection was to be started <i>in limine</i>, namely, that the corruptions he complained of were not such as occurred at the last election, but at former elections, and that there was no precedent for any bill, either of disfranchisement or regulation, so grounded. He thought every case must be judged of on its own merits. He was not bound to produce a case similar to a precedent case. But if he had wanted proof of the ground stated in the special report, he thought the extensive treating, outrageous rioting, the demoralized, abject, and depraved, condition of the voters, and the various corrupt indications at the last election, would have been amply sufficient to justify the interference of the House. But he should stand upon the charge stated in the special report&#x2014;on that notorious, long-continued, and general, practice there complained of. It was notorious, for every one of the witnesses before the committee, of whom inquiry was made concerning it, stated its notoriety, and if he wanted further evidence, he had in his hand a petition signed by the most respectable inhabitants of Retford (presented last Friday) in which this practice was set forth as one which had existed for a long period, and as one by which, in the opinion of more than two hundred of the most considerable inhabitants of Retford, the electors had forfeited their franchise. Evidence at the bar could not be better than this, for that would not be an oath, and this was signed by the parties giving the testimony. In addition, every witness before the committee, who was an elector, and had voted at former elections, admitted that he had received the election-money. It was clear then that the practice had long existed&#x2014;he believed for about seventy years. Was it then, to be imagined, that it would not
<col>672</col>
equally have taken place at the last election if the opportunity had occurred? Was it not absurd to say, that because these payments were not made at the last election (which was simply because they could not) the proceedings should be stopped? This objection was started in a petition presented, on the 8th of February, from the bailiffs, aldermen, and burgesses. But why did not these gentlemen seize upon that convenient opportunity for denying the charge against them? Not one word of denial did the petition contain; on the contrary, the omission of such denial must, under the circumstances, be taken as an admission of their guilt. They said, they should consider the suspension of the writ "a warning." Against what? Why, against the future commission of the offence charged upon them. But the House could not limit itself to a warning in so gross a case as he would prove this to be. As to the practice not obtaining at the last election&#x2014;was it not the same thing if the expectation of it generally prevailed, and had an effect upon that election. If it had no connection with the last election, he should not want precedents: he believed the case of Shoreham was one, but he considered that unimportant. He could shew very conclusively, that the most extensive use was made of the practice in influencing the burgesses at the last election.&#x2014;The hon. gentleman then made several references to the minutes, and cited the evidence of George Palfrey-man, Samuel Hindley, William Jackson, William Brown, and a letter written by direction of an agent of one of the candidates to one Joseph Marshall, which went to prove that the electors were seduced to vote for the candidates ultimately successful, on the ground of their being the strongest, and sure to pay the election-money. Thus, the practice had at the last election, as it always would, if not checked, the most injurious effect upon the public interest, by unduly and corruptly biasing the voices of the freemen. It must always operate upon the whole body of the electors prospectively, by inducing them to vote for the strongest party, without regard to qualifications. That the money was not actually paid at the last election arose from the claim being lost in consequence of the successful candidates being unseated. It was the inquiry now on foot, and the origin of that inquiry, which alone intercepted the pay-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0344"/>
<col>673</col>
ment, and was it now to be said, that because the payment was not made, the inquiry which stopped it ought not to proceed? If such an objection prevailed, the practice would be immediately recurred to, and would go on to all eternity, which was precisely what the petitioners desired. He would not detain the House longer; but he wished it to be understood, that the real question before it at present was, whether it would go into a committee to examine witnesses; and although that vote was given in the form of a vote for the second reading of the bill, he should not consider any gentleman pledged by it to support the bill hereafter in its details, which, if the evidence were deemed sufficient to justify parliamentary interference with the borough of Retford, would remain open for subsequent consideration. The hon. gentleman then moved, that the bill be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00515"><member>Mr. F. Clinton</member><membercontribution> said, that having been intrusted by the corporation of East Retford with the care of their interests, he must object to the present bill, both on principle and because, in common justice to East Retford, the House could not entertain the present measure. In every former case&#x2014;in the cases of Shoreham, Grampound, and Cricklade&#x2014;the places had not been disfranchised on loose surmises of general corruption, but instances had been adduced, in almost all the cases, of individuals having been convicted of bribery. In the present case, the committee had thought proper to bring a general charge of corruption against East Retford at a former period, not properly under their consideration. In the Penryn case, what had passed at former elections had been stated to the House; but, in that case, repeated charges of similar acts at several successive elections had been recorded on the Journals of the House; whereas this was the first time that any charge had been made against East Retford. There was great hardship towards the accused in this course. The alleged acts of bribery had taken place in the election before the last. The accused, therefore, had not the same facilities of defence as they would have had if the charge had been made at that time. The evidence before the committee showed, that out of forty witnesses, eight or ten admitted that, at the former election, they had taken bribes. This was good evidence against those individuals, but not against
<col>674</col>
others: yet this was the kind of evidence on which the committee had founded their charge. The evidence came before the committee casually and incidentally, whilst in pursuit of another object. If the present bill was suffered to pass, it would offer an easy and convenient precedent for the disfranchisement of a borough. Let it be brought before a committee on any charge, and if any instance of corruption could be shown, at any former period, then let it be disfranchised. There was another point of view in which the present measure was unjust: one fourth of the electors had been admitted to their freedom since 1820. So that if this bill passed, persons would be disfranchised to whom no guilt was imputed: it confounded the innocent with the guilty, if guilty they were. A total disfranchisement was justifiable solely on the ground that the whole body of electors were so corrupt that there was no pure stock to ingraft upon; whereas here a large body of voters were perfectly innocent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00516"><member>Mr. Stewart</member><membercontribution> opposed the bill. He said, he saw no reason why Birmingham should enjoy the privilege proposed to be taken from East Retford. There were four counties without representatives at all in that House. He would move, "that the bill be read a second time this day she months."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00517">The amendment was put, but not seconded.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00518"><member>Mr. N. Calvert</member><membercontribution> observed, that the trust with which electors were invested was similar to that of jurymen; yet it was the practice now a days, to consider the elective franchise as a great privilege. In an early period of our history there had been instances of electors petitioning the House to be exempted from the office of voting, on account of their poverty. It was now, however, found out that the office was extremely profitable, and that it was quite cruel to take it away.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00519"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, that even if he agreed with the hon. member that the trust of an elector was like that of a juryman, he must still assert, that to deprive a man of such a privilege inflicted a disgrace which would be felt painfully. He could not agree, therefore, that in these cases the complaints of the parties ought not to be listened to. The members of that House did not sit in it for their own purposes alone. A seat in that House was a burthen from which no member could
<image src="S2V0018P0I0345"/>
<col>675</col>
discharge himself. The objection of the hon. member was therefore no answer to the hon. member on the other side. If it were proved that the parties were guilty, then he admitted that their feelings ought no longer to be considered; but he could not allow that to be the case. He was not contending against the motion of his hon. friend, because the object of his hon. friend was merely to call other witnesses. He was a party to the report, and thought the case called for further inquiry; but he did not think that it was one which justified disfranchisement. It was a grave subject of inquiry, and he felt disposed to aid that inquiry; thinking it a most fit occasion for the House to exercise its inquisitorial functions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00520"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> thought it was material that it should be distinctly understood what was the principal object of the present measure. If he thought the real question involved in the proposition of the hon. gentleman was that which had been contemplated by two hon. gentlemen on his side of the House&#x2014;that it was to decide whether East Retford was to be disfranchised or not&#x2014;he might be disposed to vote against the proposition of the hon. gentleman. But he understood from his speech, that he only called on the House that evening to agree to his motion, in order that further evidence might be obtained, to enable members to make up their minds. If this were the case&#x2014;if the House was to agree to the second reading of the bill, in order that evidence might be adduced at its bar, and that it might by personal examination of the witnesses determine the extent of corruption in East Retford&#x2014;he should not refuse to the hon. member the opportunity of establishing his facts. He did not feel himself called upon to enter into the question of whether there was or was not a <i>prima facie</i> case of corruption; but he could not refuse the hon. member the opportunity he asked. Some regard should also be paid to the past proceedings of the House. The House had come last session to the second reading of a bill on this subject; he therefore thought it would be too much to set aside a former decision. On these grounds&#x2014;the special report of the committee, and the past proceeding of the House&#x2014;he gave his consent to the second reading of the bill. One part of the bill he thought objectionable, namely, that which stated the way in which the elective franchise
<col>676</col>
was to be disposed of; which was assuming the guilt of East Retford. The part of the bill to which he most objected, was that which transferred the elective franchise to Birmingham. They ought to receive evidence without any previous prepossession in favour of the bill; and if after the evidence had been gone through, they should be satisfied that the borough of East Retford had been guilty of the imputed corruption, and therefore deserved to be disfranchised, their next measure would be to decide on the place to which the forfeited franchise should be transferred. Such, he conceived to be the course which justice and propriety dictated. To all those who might have an inclination in favour of the proposed change of franchise, he would suggest the inexpediency of making a transfer from a limited jurisdiction to a place so populous and extensive as that in contemplation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00521"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> observed, that in the case of the bill for disfranchising Grampound, the name of Leeds was introduced, as the place to which the elective franchise was to be transferred; and that in the bill now in progress for disfranchising Penryn, the name of Manchester was introduced in a similar way. He had no hesitation in saying, that he was prepared, on the report of the Select Committee, to proceed to disfranchise East Retford; and he trusted that the legitimate object in view would not be met by Jesuitical evasions; but that the House would determine to do its duty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00522"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution>, in explanation, observed, that all he wished was, to wait until the evidence before the committee had proved the expediency of disfranchising East Retford: after which he should support the proposition for introducing into the bill the name of the place to which, in the opinion of the House, the elective franchise ought to be transferred.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REPEAL OF THE TEST AND CORPORATION ACTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00524"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> rose and said:&#x2014;<lb/>
I rise, Sir, in consequence of the notice which I some time ago gave upon the subject, for the purpose of submitting to the consideration of the House, a motion which, although it has not, for many
<image src="S2V0018P0I0346"/>
<col>677</col>
years, been submitted to the House, will, I am sure, not be esteemed less worthy of their attention, either on that account, or on account of the weakness of the advocate by whom it is about to be supported. I am satisfied that the great number of petitions in favour of civil and religious liberty, which are now upon your table, will, at least, induce the House to take the question into their most serious consideration; and if they do dismiss it, at least not to do so until after the investigation which its importance demands. There is one consideration, personal to myself, which I certainly feel very forcibly. It is not that I have the smallest doubt of the strength of the case. On the contrary, I feel that if brought before a House with no preconceived opinions&#x2014;no long-cherished prejudices&#x2014;an assembly, in short, new to the subject of the debate, I could not fail of success. Neither do I feel any diffidence arising from the conduct of the petitioners, whose conduct is such that no man, however he may differ from them, can impugn. There is, however, I confess, one circumstance which makes me approach this subject with a sort of awe, which, but for circumstances which I shall presently mention, would end in despair. I mean that, when the question was last before the House, though urged by the eloquence and enforced by the argument of Mr. Fox, than whom no man was ever more splendid in the one, or more forcible in the other, it miscarried. The contemplation of that failure, for such it was, is, I must confess, so dispiriting to my mind, that I would resign the case as hopeless, but for the conviction that if I cannot wield the same weapons as Mr. Fox, I have not the same enemies to encounter [hear]. So great has been the improvement in knowledge and liberality, particularly among the middle classes, that the successors of those who most warmly opposed the motion of 1790 are, in 1828, its most zealous supporters. For instance, let us look to what has taken place in the common-council of London. It is notorious, as has been mentioned by an hon. alderman, that in the year 1790, the corporation passed some strong resolutions against the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts, and voted thanks to those members of the city who had opposed the repeal is this House; but so great has been the change in men's minds on the subject since that time, that
<col>678</col>
the corporation has recently agreed to resolutions declaring those acts hostile to the principles of religious liberty. Another circumstance which I look upon as favourable to my motion is, that the powerful antagonist of Mr. Fox, in 1790, Mr. Pitt, as is now well known, did in a few years after his opposition to the measure, completely change his mind on the subject, and express a wish that the Test and Corporation acts should be repealed. He saw, as every man of enlarged and enlightened mind must have seen, that all things around him were changed since the passing of those acts; that the religious questions which had been the subject of the world's debate at the time of their enactment had given place to divisions purely political; that the dispute for power no longer lay between Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist, but between the adherents, of despotism, representative monarchy, and democracy; that he could only defend the constitution by rallying round it the victims of an extinct quarrel, and calling on men of different religious opinions to defend the same form of political government. There is only one word more which I would add by way of preface. It may be asked, if I remove these securities, what other tests would I propose? My answer is, that I am opposed to religious tests of every kind. What I should wish would be, to adopt and extend the principles of an act, the 5th of his present majesty, which enacts that persons taking office in the Customs and Excise shall not be compelled to take any oath but the oath of allegiance. I would wish to see applied to persons taking seats in parliament, and all the offices of government or corporations, a simple provision, that they should be called upon only to swear allegiance to the king.<lb/>
I now come to the great principle involved in the numerous petitions before the House; petitions signed by the whole body of Dissenters, by Roman Catholics, and by many members of the established church. That principle is, that every man ought to be allowed to form his religious opinions by the impressions on his own mind, and that, when so formed, he should be at liberty to worship God according to the dictates of his conscience, without being subjected to any penalty or disqualification whatever; that every restraint or restriction imposed on any man on account of his religious creed is in the nature
<image src="S2V0018P0I0347"/>
<col>679</col>
of persecution, and is at once an offence to God, and an injury to man. This is the just and noble principle on which the Dissenters claim the repeal of the Test laws. But I will fairly admit, that there may be an exception to its application, and I will illustrate it by reference to the general principle of non-interference by one state in the internal affairs of another. It may be stated, that one state would not generally be justified in interfering in the internal concerns of another; but if some of the internal regulations or political institutions of one state are of such a nature as to tend directly to the injury of another, then the interference properly commences on the part of the state making such regulations, and not on the part of the state which complains of them. I will say the same of religion: if the religion of any body of men be found to contain political principles hostile to the state, or militating against that allegiance which is due from every subject of the Crown, in that case the question ceases to be a religious question; and you have a right to interfere and impose such restrictions as you may deem necessary, because you do not impose them on religious opinions; you impose them only on political doctrines [hear, hear&#x0021;].<lb/>
Having said thus much generally, I proceed, Sir, first to state the history of the acts of disqualification; and secondly, to inquire whether there is any thing in the circumstances of the present time which renders the continuance of those acts necessary.<lb/>
And first for the history. It is well known to every one, that soon after the Reformation, many struggles took place in Europe, in which religion and politics were invariably connected. We are informed by the Italian cardinal who has written the History of the Troubles of the Low Countries, that Philip the 2nd upheld the Roman Catholic religion, not merely because he thought it the true religion, but likewise because he thought it the best security for political union, and obedience, throughout his vast dominions. In the same way our James the 1st professed the maxim, "No bishop, no king." On the other hand, Mr. Hume has declared it as his opinion, that for all we enjoy of liberty in this country we are indebted to the Puritans.<lb/>
It is notorious, indeed, that the Presbyterians and Independents formed the main force of that party which commenced,
<col>680</col>
carried on, and finally triumphed, in the struggle against Charles the 1st. It was natural, therefore, when his son recovered his regal rights, that one of the first steps which he took, should be to endeavour to apply a cheek to the power of those who he knew, had contributed to the deposal and death of his father. In the preamble of the Corporation act it is stated, with reference to its purpose, that the succession in corporations should be perpetuated in the hands of persons well-affected to his majesty, and the established government; "That, notwithstanding all his majesty's endeavours and unparalleled indulgence in pardoning all that was past, nevertheless many evil spirits were still working." It was to counteract the working of these evil spirits, that the Corporation act was introduced; providing that commissioners should be appointed to see that no persons should be allowed to enter into any corporation, without taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, renouncing the Solemn League and Covenant, and on making oath, "that they did not consider it lawful, upon any pretence whatsoever, to take arms against the king, and that they abhorred the traitorous position of taking arms, by his authority, against his person, or against those who were commissioned by him." In the course of discussing the measure, however, some difference took place between the two Houses of parliament; the House of Lords wishing to give the Crown the power of retaining the authority of corporations in its own hands. This the House of Commons resisted; and at length successfully; consenting, however, to the admission of a clause, providing, that no person should be admitted into any office or place contemplated in the bill, without previously taking the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the rites of the church of England.<lb/>
Sir, it is somewhat remarkable, that Hume, in his History of England, seems to have considered this clause as of so little consequence, that although he gives a pretty full abstract of the act, he never thinks it worth his while to mention this particular clause. And so far was the act from contemplating the exclusion of Dissenters generally from situations of trust and honour, that there were then about fifty Presbyterians sitting in this House, of whom only two scrupled to take the sacrament according to the rites of the Church; of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0348"/>
<col>681</col>
England. It may be said, indeed, that the act intended the exclusion of those who separated entirely from the Church of England, and that when the Presbyterians ceased to partake the communion of the Church of England, they properly came within the scope of the statute. This argument is a fair one, and I am not denying its justice; I am only stating the fact generally, that the Presbyterians were not as a body intended to be excluded. The battery was directed against the "evil spirits," who refused all reconciliation, all compromise, with the Church.<lb/>
The next act of which I have to take notice, and the only other act which I propose to refer tea committee, is the Test act. This act, every body knows, took its rise at a most remarkable period of our history&#x2014;a period at which the fate of the country was at an awful crisis. It was passed when the minds of men were in a state of agitation and alarm&#x2014;a state which, if it did not make them magnify the danger, at least prevented them from exercising their calm judgment in providing a fit remedy against it. The Test act was passed at a time when the nation was irritated and terrified at a knowledge that it possessed a concealed Roman Catholic king&#x2014;a duke of York, the successor to the Throne, an avowed Papist&#x2014;an odious alliance with France, secretly formed for the purpose of destroying the liberties of England, and an army at Blackheath ready to overawe all deliberation. Under these circumstances the Test act was passed, and about the object of it there can be no dispute, for this is clearly explained in the preamble, which also describes the public necessities out of which it arose. The act is entitled an act "for preventing dangers which may happen from Popish recusants, and quieting the minds of his majesty's good subjects, &amp;c." The minds of his majesty's good subjects were disquieted&#x2014;by whom?&#x2014;by the Dissenters? No, by the Roman Catholics. It was, then, quite evident, that the Test act was not passed with a view of excluding Protestant Dissenters&#x2014;so little so, that while it was under deliberation, and many persons were inclined to vote against it, because they thought it would operate against Dissenters, a well-known Dissenter rose in the House, and said, that the "Dissenters would rather lie under the severity of the law than clog so necessary a work." The
<col>682</col>
Test act, therefore, was intended as a guard against the partiality of the king upon the throne for a particular sect; but it is now made to apply to sects for which it was never intended, and to a sovereign of a totally different disposition.<lb/>
The House of Commons attempted, on various occasions, to relieve Protestant Dissenters from the burthen which this' act imposed upon them; but the king always evaded the obnoxious measure, several times proroguing the parliament, and on one occasion the clerk of the Crown was ordered not to present to the' king a bill which had been passed by both Houses for the relief of the Dissenters. Thus the Commons were strong to persecute the Catholics, but not to relieve the Dissenters, and the king, who found' himself unable to relieve the Catholics, consoled himself by persecuting the Dissenters.<lb/>
Let us now observe the difference in the manner of proceeding with regard to the Dissenters, and with regard to the Roman Catholics. When parliament wished; to dislodge the Dissenters they naturally and properly, properly, I mean, with a view to their object&#x2014;gave to the king the power of purging the corporations, and imposed a test to exclude members who might be elected by a dissenting majority. They did not exclude them from offices under the Crown. Why? because they did not suspect the Crown of any partiality towards the Protestant Dissenters, and where there was no danger they took no security. 'But when they wished to guard against the Roman Catholics, they proceeded very differently. They put up their bar against the entrance to office; they guarded the road to the royal palace. Why? because the king was suspected to be a papist.<lb/>
I wish, Sir, to lay the more stress upon, this, because, much as we hear of the wisdom of our ancestors, I think that wisdom, such as it was, is not properly appreciated. A religious test on admission to offices of the Crown is, in ordinary circumstances, an absurdity. It is at best a circuitous mode of ascertaining a man's political opinion. It is often a very false mode. For instance, in the hottest rage of the wars of the Reformation, queen Elizabeth could trust the Roman Catholic peers with the defence of the court of England against the Armada of Philip the 2nd, the great patron of Popery. To take an instance on the other side from, more modern times
<image src="S2V0018P0I0349"/>
<col>683</col>
&#x2014;during the Irish rebellion&#x2014;Wolfe Tone could have taken any religious test you could have put to him, but it would have been the height of imprudence to place him in any office of trust, and in all likelihood he would have joined the invading army. A religious test, therefore, is a bungling and fallacious proof of loyalty. A man's opinions are known from his conversation, his character, his associates; and the best security you can have in the disposal of office is to leave to the discretion of the executive to reward the loyal and keep down the disaffected.<lb/>
But at the time of which I am speaking, this test could not be used. The king himself was pretty well known to be of the dangerous sect. Parliament, therefore, the best security failing, resorted to one of an inferior kind; the best under the circumstances. But for us, who have the security of a king attached to the Church of England, by law, by affection, and by principle, what need have we of keeping up the barrier that was erected, not to defend the throne from the people, but to defend the people from the throne? As a further illustration of what I have been saying, allow me to mention what appears at first sight a strange anomaly in our law. The sacramental test is not applied to ecclesiastical offices. A bishop's chancellor for instance, or a bishop's registrar, was never subject to it. Why? because parliament could safely confide to the discretion of the bishop that he would not appoint an enemy to the Church.<lb/>
I come now to the time of our Revolution, when it might be expected that these illiberal and impolitic laws would be repealed; but in fact no alteration whatever was made in them. William came down to parliament and openly expressed his wish that all Dissenters, who were "willing and able to serve," should be admitted to offices and places of trust; but those who had to conduct the government, considering that the Revolution had changed the dynasty, and that the Church was greatly offended by the introduction of the Toleration act, did not think it safe, if it was meant that the establishment should last, to grant any further liberty to the Dissenters at that time. I hope that my right hon. friend near me (sir James Mackintosh) will confirm the statement I now make of the view which our Whig ancestors took of the position of affairs at that time. Indeed, I have the authority of
<col>684</col>
Bishop Burnet for saying that the church at that time was anxious for the repeal of the Toleration act, and wished for the restoration of the Stuart family. Under such circumstances, therefore, it would have been dangerous, by granting further concessions, to provoke the more active enmity of the great body of the clergy. In the same situation, affairs continued daring all the changes of parties (for when the high Tory party were in power, they, of course, were against granting any liberty whatever) till the time of George 1st, when earl Stanhope, a zealous Whig, proposed to introduce a clause for repealing certain parts of the Test and Corporation acts into a bill brought into the House of Lords. The clause met with serious opposition in the House of Lords, but at the same time was supported by some of the men most eminent for loyalty and public spirit, and likewise by some of the most learned among the bishops. I mention this latter circumstance, because we are not accustomed in the present day to hear from bishops sentiments favourable to liberty. The clause proposed by earl Stanhope was supported by the bishops of Gloucester and Lincoln, but more especially by Hoadly, bishop of Bangor, and Kennet, bishop of Peterborough, from whose speeches I will, with the permission of the House, read two short extracts:&#x2014;Bishop Hoadly said, that "the imposing of religious tests as a qualification for civil and military employments abridges men of their natural rights, deprives the state of the services of many of its best subjects, and exposes the most sacred ordinances of the church to be profaned by irreligious men for temporal purposes. The principle of depriving men of any of their civil rights on account of their religion, however moderately exercised, and however speciously covered by the name of self-defence, would justify the persecutions of Heathens against Christians, and those of the Inquisition against Protestants." Bishop Kennet said, that "he could not allow this bill to be against the Church, but thought it tended rather to its advantage and security; that he had observed from history, the Church was most flourishing when the clergy did not affect more power than fell to their share, and were tender of the liberties of their fellow subjects; but that when the clergy promoted arbitrary measures and persecutions, as they did in the reign of Charles 1st, they brought scandal
<image src="S2V0018P0I0350"/>
<col>685</col>
and contempt upon themselves, and at last ruin upon the church and state." "That the words 'church,' and 'danger of the church,' had been used out of their original use to carry on sinister designs; that those words made a mighty noise in the mouths of silly women and children" [hear, hear]. I would not venture to use such language. The House will remember it was a bishop who was speaking. His speech continues in these words, "in his opinion, the Church of England, which he defined to be a scriptural institution upon a legal establishment, was founded upon a rock, and could not be endangered so long as we enjoyed the light of the Gospel and our excellent constitution." Similar sentiments were entertained by some of the most enlightened prelates of that day. Still, however, lord Stanhope failed in his object, and the clauses were rejected. Sir Robert Walpole, who succeeded, being a man who never gave up, during his long career, any practical good for the sake of a large and general principle, constantly opposed every effort made in parliament for removing the restrictions on Dissenters, at the same time telling them that he was favourable to their objects; that he approved of their views, but that he never would support them. Such was the wisdom of our ancestors at that period. They thought that the House of Hanover would not receive the support of the Church if they gave further relief to the Dissenters, and the Dissenters themselves consented to endure their privations for the sake of the inestimable blessing which they found to flow from the expulsion of the Stuart dynasty and the establishment of the Brunswick family. The Dissenters, indeed, as zealous in behalf of the House of Hanover and the political liberties of the country, as they were, in the reign of Charles 2nd, shewed themselves willing to submit to the operation of a severe law rather than allow the necessary work of the establishment of liberty to be at all endangered.<lb/>
From the feeling of the government on this subject&#x2014;merely wishing to favour, and not attempting to remove at once all disabilities&#x2014;arose an anomalous state of things. Four acts of indemnity were passed in the reigns of George 1st, and 2nd. and before the year 1743&#x2014;-acts indemnifying persons who had not complied with the forms of the Cor-
<col>686</col>
poration and Test acts. In point of strict justice nothing could be less defensible. If the Dissenters were dangerous, they ought to have been excluded altogether; and if not, they should have been fully admitted. A single instance will suffice to show the absurd and anomalous position in which the question regarding Dissenters was thus placed. In 1745, many Nonconformists came in to assist in supporting the government, and suppressing the rebellion raised by prince Charles, who attempted to obtain possession of the Throne. They acted most gallantly in co-operation with the king's forces, and their exertions were crowned with success. It might naturally be supposed, that they would have received some acknowledgment of their services. What reward does the House suppose was bestowed upon the men who had defended the king, maintained the authority of parliament, and vindicated the liberty of the country? Did the Crown shower orders and honours upon them? Did parliament vote them their thanks? Did the people express to them their gratitude? No such thing: the sovereign gave them no honours, the parliament no thanks, and the people no gratitude&#x2014;they received for their glorious services from the munificence of king, parliament, and people&#x2014;a full and free pardon. Is any thing more wanting to shew the absurdity of laws, which brand the most loyal of the king's subjects, and inflict penalty on the best deeds of patriotism and courage they can perform? The act of 1747, so far from being singular, however, has now for eighty-five years been the principle of your legislation on this subject&#x2014;A pardon, such as it is, not like the act of 1747, but conditional and incomplete, is passed yearly to forgive good men for doing good service to their country.<lb/>
So much for the history of these acts&#x2014;And it brings me immediately to the principle upon which they are founded&#x2014;you enacted them to guard against a particular danger; does that danger now exist? If danger were apprehended from Dissenters, why pass acts from year to year pardoning those who by law are excluded from taking office for taking office? I can easily imagine the necessity of pursuing such a course for five, ten, or fifteen years. Government may have said, "Wait a little, we are not assured of the loyalty of these persons: do not give them freedom
<image src="S2V0018P0I0351"/>
<col>687</col>
all at once, but see first how they will act." But that parliament should go on with acts of indemnity for eighty-five years&#x2014;that they should not, at this time of day be satisfied of the loyalty of the Dissenters, is a thing against all rules of justice, of policy, and of prudence.<lb/>
The next objection is to the nature of the Tests required, which are of a very serious and solemn character. The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is held by the Church to be most sacred, and it is declared that those who receive it unworthily "eat and drink their own damnation." There are other words of similar import in different parts of our Liturgy. This solemn rite is used for the purpose of ascertaining the fitness of persons to hold civil office. A person of eminence in the last century, Dean Sherlock, said, indeed, "We oblige no man to take the sacrament, but if he can, and does receive it, we admit him to office." But this is a mere evasion&#x2014;When men are told that if they take the sacrament, they will be fit to hold office, and not without, it is in fact holding out to them a temptation to abuse the sacrament, and to pervert the most holy of God's ordinances to purposes of the most paltry ambition. It is putting the consideration of patronage and profit in contradiction with the most sacred duty a Christian can perform. I beg to call the attention of the House to the practice which prevailed before the indemnity bills came into operation. It might happen that when a person went to receive the sacrament the clergyman would refuse to administer it, from motives of personal malice. If this were the case he sustained a civil injury. The learned dean to whom I have before referred, says, that "if a person were refused the sacrament from malice on the part of the clergyman, he might go into a court of law and complain of the civil injury which he suffered in consequence." It is held in the courts of law, that if any person who is refused the sacrament has committed some open sin, no civil injury has taken place. Let the House imagine the situation in which a clergyman is placed, who may from his own knowledge be aware that the person applying for the sacrament is not worthy to receive it, yet cannot prove that he has committed any open and notorious sin. According to the oath which he has taken, and the ordination imposed on him, he should refuse the sacrament under
<col>688</col>
such circumstances; but then he knows that if he does so, he will be dragged into a court of law, and forced to pay a penalty. This was the situation of a clergyman at the period to which I allude, and consequently being obliged to administer the sacrament to all persons, such scenes of scandal took place as it is hardly possible to describe. It is stated in historical works, that it was the custom for persons to be waiting in taverns and houses near the church, not going in until service was over. The ceremony used to be called "qualifying for office;" and an appointed person called out, "Those who want to be qualified will please to step up this way." Persons, then took the communion for the purpose of receiving office, and with no other intent whatever. Such are the consequences of mixing politics with religion. You embitter and aggravate political dissentions by the venom of theological disputes; you profane religion with the vices of political ambition, making it both hateful to man and offensive to God.<lb/>
Seeing the right hon. representative for the University of Oxford opposite, I must really put it to him, whether he is prepared to say, that that University desires such acts as those now complained of to be continued, in order to maintain the purity of religion?&#x2014;whether he thinks that legislation of this kind is calculated to induce men to entertain a greater respect for religion, or to induce Dissenters to believe that the church from which they differ is pure and blameless.<lb/>
It is said, however, "after all, the grievances of which you complain are only theoretical&#x2014;they no longer exist in practice&#x2014;Dissenters are not in fact kept out of office." I will say, in the first place, that if the case be so, that is not a sufficient argument in support of these acts. Statutes imposing penalties and restrictions, on men on account of religious belief can be justified on no other ground than that of necessity. When that ground is taken away, the acts remain exposed in all their naked deformity of principle, and that principle is religious persecution. But it is not a fact that no practical grievance is suffered by the Dissenters. Indeed the fact is far otherwise&#x2014;the real practical grievance is a great deal more than the legal grievances which appear on the face of the statute. Though it be true that by later; statutes indemnity was given to those who
<image src="S2V0018P0I0352"/>
<col>689</col>
omitted to qualify, yet that indemnity was given on the ground that the omission was occasioned by ignorance, absence, or unavoidable accident. Those words evidently do not apply to those persons who had omitted to qualify from grounds of religious scruple. The situation in which the Dissenters at present stand is evidently considered one of practical grievance by the best and ablest defender of the acts, I mean lord North, who said, speaking of those Dissenters who took advantage of the indemnity, "This sort of mental fraud did not recommend these persons to the indulgence of the legislature; it was an evasion and an abuse of an act of parliament." With, such a declaration as this staring them in the face, how can it be expected that men whose nice scruples are the cause of their dissent will submit to the stigma&#x2014;will render themselves liable to the imputation&#x2014;of acting fraudulently, in order to obtain offices and emoluments which the Church would allow them to obtain in no other way? That they will not do so, I know for a fact. A great portion of the Dissenters say among themselves, "we will not accept of office on these conditions: if we cannot hold office without the degradation of being liable to an imputation which we scorn, we will refrain from office and emolument altogether." What is the consequence? The state is deprived of the service of men who would be amongst her bravest defenders in military achievement, and the most illustrious of her servants in civil capacity. The individuals thus shut out will always retain&#x2014;I will not say a bitterness&#x2014;but&#x2014;a soreness of feeling against the church which excludes them, and the state which makes their admission to office a reproach to them.<lb/>
Not only this; it should also be recollected, that it is in the power of any corporation, actuated by bigotry, or personal animosity, to carry the Corporation act into effect against Dissenters. I have in my possession a statement of cases which have occurred in the course of the last few years, in which persons who had a minority of votes in elections for corporation offices have been declared duly elected, because a previous notice had been given that the individuals who had the majorities could not act from being Dissenters. If there are so many cases of this kind that appear in the records of a court of law, how many other cases must
<col>690</col>
there be in which the Dissenters will not come forward to expose themselves to the risk of such an objection? More than this: persons admitted to office ought, under the Test act, to produce their certificates. Dissenters do not like to expose themselves to the chance of those certificates being demanded. Rather than that, they will consent to forego office. The consequence is, that not one tenth part of the Dissenters who ought, in proportion to their numbers, at present hold office.<lb/>
I have now stated, Sir, some of the practical grievances under which the Dissenters labour, but I am aware, whilst I am proving that these acts operate to the exclusion of Dissenters, I am only confirming many persons in the belief that it is necessary to continue them. I allude to those persons who use the argument of the security of the Church, and who think that in proportion as the number of Dissenters excluded is large, it is so much the better for the Church, that the establishment is so much the safer. I however, cannot admit that the security of the' Church is founded on any such exclusion. I think with bishop Kennet, and I believe the security of the establishment consists in its moderation, its fair temper, and in its decent worship being conformable to the wishes, sentiments, and consciences of the majority of the people; and if it were not so&#x2014;if it were not agreeable to the people&#x2014;can it be imagined that any Test, any exclusive laws, will save the Church, and prevent its being destroyed by the overwhelming mass of its enemies?<lb/>
"But," says a learned prelate of the present day, "the property of the Church will be liable to be affected by the various classes of Dissenters, if you admit them all to office." I think that argument is the most impolitic that could be advanced; for if those who use it ostentatiously declare that they cannot admit the numerous millions&#x2014;I will not say how many&#x2014;of Protestant and Catholic Dissenters, to the enjoyment of the civil rights of English-: men, because such enjoyment necessarily tends to the destruction of the church property, in the minds of all those Dissenters the enjoyment of civil rights and the division of church property are sure to be confounded. I consider it most impolitic to use such an argument, and I likewise consider it quite unfounded. With respect to the Protestant Dissenters&#x2014;at least the greatest part of them&#x2014;they can-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0353"/>
<col>691</col>
not be supposed to entertain the desire of taking any of the church property to themselves. And why? Because they consider that a rich Church is not the instrument by which Christianity can be best promoted; and, therefore, they can have no wish to aggrandize themselves. If the security of the Church of England be founded solely on the Test and Corporation acts, I will ask what is the security for the Church of Scotland? By the articles of Union, the Presbyterian is declared the true religion&#x2014;it is the established Church of that country, and yet no Test or Corporation acts exist there. Nothing of the kind. If these laws be necessary for the security of the Church of England, they ought likewise to be enacted for the security of the Church of Scotland.<lb/>
But their case is still stronger.&#x2014;In order to diminish still further the security of our northern Church, persons of the Church of Scotland cannot come to this country and take office without being liable to the penalties of these acts, although being of the church established by law in another part of the kingdom. Then, with respect to Ireland: if the Corporation and Test acts be necessary to the security of the Church in England, it would be supposed that they must necessarily exist in Ireland. That, however, is not the fact. The Corporation act never, I believe, existed in Ireland. The Test act was introduced there in the reign of Anne, and was abolished some forty-eight or forty-nine years ago, since which time it has not existed in that country. Yet the House will remember, that a right hon. friend near me, not many years ago, told them, that, in conversation, a person of considerable importance in the state said it would be dangerous to concede the Catholic claims, because it would lead to the repeal of the Test act in Ireland, without which the Church never would be safe. This anecdote shows how much of what is really fanciful and imaginary, enters into the arguments of those who talk of danger to the Church, and call for securities.<lb/>
Another argument in support of these acts, which was much relied on in the course of the last century, was found in a letter of our great deliverer; who declared it to be "a thing contrary to all the laws and customs of all Christian states, whether Protestants or Papists, who admitted none to a share in the government, or public
<col>692</col>
employments, but those who professed the public and established religion, and endeavoured to secure it against all attempts whatsoever." Such was the argument of king William; but how does it apply to the present time? Is it now the case, that persons who do not profess the religion of the state are excluded from civil and military employments in all countries? The fact is notoriously otherwise. In France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Austria in Italy, no such law exists; but persons of all religious persuasions are eligible to office. The English Protestant Dissenter, if he were to leave his country, might be admitted to all the employments of Catholic Austria, might go from exclusion at Bath or Huntingdon, to sit in the municipality of Prague or of Milan, might even be admitted to the council of state of Vienna, and yet here he still stands a suppliant, imploring tardy justice from the parliament of Protestant England&#x0021;<lb/>
I have now gone through the chief points I wished to press upon the attention of the House. I have shown that history will not justify you in maintaining these acts. The first of them was raised as a barrier to the throne against a party who had recently overturned it. But whatever the Dissenters of that day might feel towards the House of Stuart, the Dissenters of the present feel nothing but loyalty towards the House of Hanover. The Test act, again, was intended as a barrier against the king, who was a converted Papist; you have now a sovereign who is firmly attached to the established religion. For a long period these acts were maintained for fear of driving the Church into the arms of the Jacobites: there is now no fear that the clergy will look for promotion or favour through any other than the legitimate channel of his majesty's Treasury and Chancery. I have shown you that all ground of necessity fails, the acts having been suspended for more than three quarters of a century. I have proved, I trust, that they violate the sacred rights of conscience, and are of the nature of religious persecution.&#x2014;I have shown that, so far from not inflicting any hardship on the body upon whom they operate, they are fraught with great mischief, irritation, and injustice. I have shown, that they are totally at variance with our own policy in Scotland and Ireland, as well as with the enlightened legislation of all the Christian countries of Europe. If I am asked what advantage
<image src="S2V0018P0I0354"/>
<col>693</col>
the country is to derive from the abrogation of such laws, I answer, that the obvious tendency of the measure, independently of its justice, will be, to render the Dissenters better affected to the government, to inspire them with dispositions to bear the heavy burthens imposed on them by the necessities of the state with cheerfulness, or, at least, with resignation; and, above all, it will be more consonant to the tone and spirit of the age than the existence of those angry yet inefficient and impracticable laws which are a disgrace to the Statute-book. I have heard with considerable pain, that it is the intention of the new ministry to make this what is called a government question, to array all the power which their influence can muster against it. I am sorry to learn this; not on account of the question itself, whose progress they may retard, but never can prevent&#x2014;I am sorry to hear it, because it is an indication, on the part of government, of a determination to resist the liberality which is daily gaining ground in the great mass of society. Whatever kings or parliaments may think of their power, they must more or less submit to be influenced by the spirit of the times in which they live. The history of the last few years speaks aloud this undeniable truth.&#x2014;Of lord Liverpool, his warmest admirers must admit that the country governed him at least as much as he governed the country. It was conformity to this spirit that constituted all of hope and fame that attached to the political character of Mr. Canning&#x2014;his name was great because he went along with the spirit of the times. Even the illustrious person now at the head of his majesty's government must consult the same voice, and conform to the same standard. That illustrious person is justly hailed as the preserver of Portugal, the deliverer of Spain, the conqueror of Waterloo,&#x2014;as one of the greatest military chiefs his country has ever produced&#x2014;that country, to whose gratitude and admiration he is entitled by a list of services never to be forgotten. But even he, with all his fame, standing in such a position as few men have ever stood in, with the patronage of the church, and the state, and the army in his hands,&#x2014;an army of one hundred and ten thousand men, attached to him not merely by their interests or their professional hopes, but by the memory of past dangers&#x2014;possessing the confidence, I had
<col>694</col>
almost said the authority, of his Sovereign&#x2014;yet even he, with all his character, with all his patronage, with all his power, must modify the exercise of those several qualities, and in the tone and features of his government, if he would have it last, conform to the spirit of the times in" which he lives. No matter how great his achievements or his glory, to the spirit of improvement which has gone abroad he must bow. It is wisdom to do so without reluctance or hesitation,&#x2014;it is wisdom to take his lesson from the signs of the hour, without waiting for the dictation of necessity, or allowing a meritorious body of: individuals to stand, year after year, at the doors of parliament, asking for what it is a disgrace to have so long refused. Such is the line of conduct that would best become the government; but, whether adopted by the government or not, the House is interested in observing it, and by agreeing with the motion with which I shall conclude, they will but discharge their duty, and render an act of justice to three millions of their fellow-subjects. I move, Sir, "That this House will resolve itself into a Committee of the whole House, to consider of so much of the Acts of the 13th and 25th of Charles 2nd, as requires persons, before they are admitted into any office or place in Corporations, or having accepted any office, civil or military, or any place of trust under the Crown, to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the Rites of the Church of England."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00525"><member>Mr. John Smith</member><membercontribution> rose to second the motion. He began by observing, that from conversations which he had lately held with several members of parliament, he was much surprised to find that great ignorance prevailed amongst them with respect to the nature of the statutes of which the Dissenters complained. He would, therefore, take the liberty of stating what those statutes were, in order that the House might see the necessity for its interference.<lb/>
The Test act was passed, as his noble friend had said, without any reference whatever to the Dissenters; but its operation extended over a much wider range than those who had not examined the subject would be inclined to believe. It affected all persons who held any office under the king, as well as under those persons who derived their authority from the king; so that not only those who held
<image src="S2V0018P0I0355"/>
<col>695</col>
offices in the household, in the army, and in the navy, but a number of obscure individuals, who held small employments in any department connected, however remotely, with the government, were liable to the penalties of the act. Nor was it merely the commissioned officers of the army and navy who came under it. The non-commissioned officers, the sergeants, and corporals, were affected by it, as well as a whole host of civilians in the humblest walks of life, down to the very pedlar who hawked his goods about the country.<lb/>
He would now point out the penalties to which those persons were exposed for not taking the sacrament. In the first instance, there was the forfeiture of the place which the offending individual held. Next, he was rendered incapable of holding any other. Again, he was disqualified from maintaining a suit at law. Still further, he was prevented from accepting the office of guardian, and, to crown all, he was rendered incapable of inheriting a legacy; and after being robbed of his property by the sweeping injustice of the act, he was saddled with a penalty of 500<i>l</i>. It was true, that these laws were so cruel that they were never enforced; but could that be alleged as a reason for keeping them in the Statute-book, or was it not an unanswerable argument in the mouths of those who called on the legislature for their repeal? He understood it was the intention of the right hon. Secretary, the member for the University of Oxford, to oppose the motion. Such at least was the report which he had heard, on more than one occasion, out of the House. But, whatever ground the right hon. gentleman might adopt in support of his views, he would not&#x2014;he could not&#x2014;rest his argument on the ground of religious opinions. Nor was it easy to imagine how he could argue for the continuance of such acts upon any principle of political expediency. Looking at it in that point of view, he would ask whether it would not be more merciful to throw a man into the Thames at once, than to deprive him of his civil rights, and expose him to all the injuries of a defenceless and degraded condition? The right hon. gentleman was one of those who knew how to feel for the distresses of others, and this was an appeal to his benevolent feelings too strong to be easily set aside. The whole of the penal statutes went upon one unfortunate and absurd mistake. Our ancestors, whom (he knew
<col>696</col>
not why) we were in the habit of calling wise, had considered that belief was an act of the will, and not of the understanding. Upon that false assumption they had gone on adding penalty to penalty, and statute to statute, in the vain endeavour to control, by fear and by force, what was only to be effected by persuasion. And who, he would remind the House again, were the individuals exposed to those acts, if they were enforced? The officers of the army and navy, commissioned and noncommissioned; the numerous persons employed in the various departments of the Customs and Excise; together with all those who were in the service of chartered companies, of whatever kind or description. He had spoken within these few days to an old friend of his, a Bank director, and had asked him, amongst other questions, whether he had qualified for that station? The answer was, that he supposed so, of course accompanied with some surprise that his qualification should be doubted. The next question he had put was one for which his friend was still less prepared:&#x2014;it was, whether he had conformed to the religious ceremony required by these acts? It was scarcely necessary to say, that he had not conformed; for he did not even know that such a ceremony was required by the existing law. The House might take it for granted, that the officers of the army and navy were not much better informed on the subject than his friend. He had himself been in company with a field-officer not long ago, who had served in the four quarters of the world, but who had never heard of the Test act, its demands, or its penalties, through the whole course of his promotion and services. It was true he had never suffered from its operation; but that was not enough to sanction the existence of unjust and arbitrary laws. Why should they have any laws which they were ashamed, or incapable of enforcing?<lb/>
The Dissenters of the present day were as intelligent, as loyal, as prosperous, and as industrious, a class of people as any within his majesty's dominions. It was now three or four and twenty years ago since the people had enrolled themselves as volunteers for the defence of their common country. At that period he had had the honour to command a corps raised in the city of London, and consisting of many Dissenters. He had had an opportunity of observing their conduct, not only in his
<image src="S2V0018P0I0356"/>
<col>697</col>
own corps, but generally throughout the country, when two hundred thousand Dissenters were volunteers. No men could display greater enthusiasm in the cause&#x2014;no men could conduct themselves with more discretion. It had never entered the head of any one to suspect them of disaffection, or to represent them as unfit to be intrusted with arms. In every capacity it was the same&#x2014;their conduct would bear the strictest scrutiny. In learning, in talent, in morals, they had distinguished themselves, as well as in the humbler virtues which constituted the worth of citizens. He could mention names amongst them which would at once command the reverence of Christians of every sect&#x2014;that of Lardner, for instance; but it was unnecessary to particularize. They could boast of eminent men in all professions&#x2014;of useful men in all the avocations of life. It was ridiculous, absurd, and mischievous, at that time of day, to slander such a class of persons by keeping on the Statute-book acts which, though they were not enforced, amounted to a gross insult. When he considered the nature of religious enthusiasm, and looked back at the actions it had given rise to&#x2014;when he saw amongst the Dissenters of later date, men who had fought the battles of the country, and had shed their blood in its defence&#x2014;men to whom we owed our former glory and our present safety&#x2014;it was impossible not to feel the gross injustice, as well as the imprudence, of continuing these obnoxious statutes. The body of men of whom the non-commissioned officers were composed were generally Scotch. Of the Scotch, he would say, what had been said of them by a high authority&#x2014;that the Scotch Presbyterian was not a very docile animal: on the contrary, he was disposed to adhere firmly to his religion; and it was the opinion of one of the most eminent men in the Scotch church, that a Presbyterian complying with the regulations of the Test act, abandoned his own faith and followed that of the Church of England. They had had Scotchmen amongst them who held situations of high importance; a circumstance not to be wondered at, when it was considered, that their talents, their industry, and their moral character, were of a description to give them a preference over the natives of most other countries. He asked, were such individuals to be exposed to the annoyance of an enactment like that now in question? Was it to be
<col>698</col>
expected that their soldiers, their officers and non-commissioned officers, would bear with such a law? He held it to be impossible. It was in vain to think of enforcing the conditions required by these acts on a people so attached to their own opinions as the Presbyterians, and so instructed, by those whom they regarded as authorities in matters of church government and discipline? They could not enforce it on them, nor on such officers of the army and navy as were Dissenters. Nay, if it was the misfortune of England to have a minister weak and wicked enough to enforce the legal penalties for the neglect, the Speaker of that House might expect some afternoon, while he was at his devotions, preparatory to the business of the day, to see a party of zealots enter the House, as once they had done, and tell him, that he must go and "seek the Lord elsewhere." To be sure, it was said on the other side, "We do not intend that these acts should be put in force, and we show you that we entertain no such intention by passing an annual Indemnity bill." What did hon. gentlemen mean by adopting this course? Was it that they desired to hold the Test act over the heads of the Dissenters <i>in terrorem?</i> Did the penalties mean nothing? If they did not, they were only calculated to inspire ridicule and contempt. He left it to the House to determine whether the course hitherto adopted ought to be persisted in.<lb/>
In looking back at the history of the debates on this subject, he had observed an argument put forward under the sanction of some of the greatest names ever known in this country. It was an argument that was expected to silence all opposition, and was to this effect:&#x2014;"That Dissenters were troublesome and impertinent persons, to complain of the exercise of that right which every government enjoyed, to regulate as it pleased the conduct and profession of all persons who should take office under it, either civil or military." This right, it was contended, was an abstract right, which every government might enforce, it being for those who sought office to consider whether or not they would comply with the regulations imposed upon them. He was ready to meet the assertion of this principle with utter disdain. He denied it altogether, and would take the liberty, as a plain man, to employ his common sense in looking at it. He held that no man could claim to exercise a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0357"/>
<col>699</col>
right to the wrong or injury of another. If this was true in the case of a single individual, it was true as it regarded a country. He submitted the assumption which was made to fix certain regulations upon taking office to the criterion of public utility. He meant by the phrase "public-utility," that course which gave the greatest happiness to the greatest number of individuals. Referring to this principle, he could not discover how the right claimed contributed to the happiness of any; but he clearly perceived that it impaired, or might impair, the happiness of all. It was, therefore, incumbent on the House to repeal an act which in principle was so hostile to the spirit of the constitution, and which in practice was found to be attended with so many inconveniences. The subject was too ridiculous to admit of argument. He would refer to a publication by a gentleman whom it was impossible to name without respect and admiration&#x2014;one who had always exerted his talents, and they were various, on the side of liberality&#x2014;he alluded to the rev. Sydney Smith&#x2014;who, in one of his publications, had said, in reference to the exclusive principle unhappily adopted in our domestic policy, that it was not more rational to persevere in it, than to make a regulation that we should employ no individuals who happened to have red hair. The Dissenters felt no objection to the sacramental rite, but in so far as it was considered a holy one; but they did not wish that a rite ordained by the author of our religion, for sacred purposes, should be profaned by applying it to the attainment of civil offices. Rather than do so they were content to remain in poverty and obscurity: and surely their objection was a conscientious one. A Baptist or Unitarian might, for different reasons, say, that they would not comply with the sacramental test, because they entertained conscientious scruples which they were not content to sacrifice to their personal advantage. This might be considered a foolish principle, but he respected it. The parties making objections of this kind took for their rule the law of the Almighty, as they understood it, and by that law endeavoured to regulate their actions. Hypocrites in religion might dispense with the form as well as the substance, when it suited their convenience to do so; and it was the curse of a country which enacted such laws, to make hypocrites by act of parliament. But the men who,
<col>700</col>
in defiance of such laws and the penalties they threatened, and the poverty they entailed, stood firm to their conscientious opinions, instead of being objectionable, were "worthy of all acceptation," and were much more worthy of employment than those who were capable of courting it by the surrender of their principles. Was there any man in that House who could withhold his admiration from the purity of sentiment, and from the elevation of mind, which these individuals had so long displayed? And yet, what was the reward which they had hitherto received? Their reward was a cruel and unjust code of penal laws. He was sorry that such laws should ever have found their way into our Statute-book; for in every country in which such laws had been established, they had been found the certain promoters of bitterness and discord, if not of bloodshed and civil war.<lb/>
The motion of that night called upon them to do an act of justice to three-eighths of the population of Great Britain, who were insulted, and grossly insulted, by the continuance of these unjust, and ridiculous, and antiquated laws. Let the House also reflect on the injury which these laws were inflicting on the inhabitants of another part of the empire. They were injuring, in Ireland, seven millions of persons, by keeping them in a state of degradation and ignorance, which was not only dreadful to themselves, but dangerous to the common weal. Were these laws repealed, the Dissenters would cherish feelings of amity towards the established church, and a union would be cemented between England and Ireland, which had hitherto existed in little but name. They lived in an age that well deserved to be called extraordinary and wonderful&#x2014;an age in which moral improvement, and scientific improvement, and mechanical improvement, were raising men far above their former level, were giving them powers and endowments which they had never previously possessed, and were inciting them, with a force which could not be resisted, to those manly and invigorating pursuits after truth, which could not fail to confer the most signal benefits upon society. Would they, under such circumstances, persist in the support of laws which had been engendered by fanaticism, and nourished by unrelenting ignorance and prejudice? They ought not to forget, that Great Britain had been the nurse
<image src="S2V0018P0I0358"/>
<col>701</col>
of toleration; and that, though she had often acted in the spirit of persecution, she had been the first to teach a milder and a better spirit to the civilized world. He was sure that if common sense should continue to exercise its influence in the country, all the acts which disqualified individuals for civil offices on account of their religious opinions, must be obliterated from the Statute-book. Whenever that blessed period should arrive, Great Britain would be hailed as the arbitress and benefactress of mankind; and he was convinced that she was only prevented from enjoying that high distinction at the present moment, by the cruel enactments which she still retained among the statutes of her land. He was sorry to have trespassed so long upon the attention of the House; but the importance, the paramount importance, of the subject must be his excuse. "If you shall determine to proceed in the career which you have so long pursued," said the hon. member, "you may depend upon it, that great evils will impend over you, whereas all of them may be averted by your adopting a different course: peace and happiness may then come among you, and remain with you to the most distant generations." In conclusion, he thanked the House for listening to him so patiently, and ended by seconding the motion of his noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00526"><member>Mr. Marshall</member><membercontribution> said, that having presented many petitions from his constituents, who were anxious for the repeal of these intolerant laws, he could not give a silent vote on this occasion. He did not participate in the great anxiety which some persons felt for the repeal of these laws, because he considered them as virtually repealed by the annual Indemnity acts. The Test act had been laid asleep for nearly a century, during which period not one opportunity had occurred, not one solitary occasion, upon which the friends of intolerance and bigotry had dared to put it in force. Could they, then, hope-could they flatter themselves, that any future occasion could arise, which would give them the power of enforcing this odious law?&#x2014;A law which might inflict the most atrocious penalties on a man, who had served his country in some useful office, but who had refused to profane a solemn religious rite for secular purposes. It would be too revolting to the spirit of the age, too gross an insult on common sense, for any legislature, for any House
<col>702</col>
of Commons (even constituted as that House was), to enforce such a law. Then why keep it on the Statute-books? It was worse than childish to hold a rod over our backs which they dared not use. These intolerant laws had been repealed in every civilized country, but our own. England, enlightened England, was the only country which cherished and preserved them&#x0021; It was believed by some, that these laws were a security to the established church, but this was a most mistaken opinion. What could compensate the church for the odium which these laws created against it? for the irritated and resentful feelings of a majority of the population of the kingdom, who were deprived of equal civil rights with that class of their fellow-citizens, who enjoyed the whole of the revenues which the state appropriates to religious services? The Dissenters were accused of denying to their Roman Catholic fellow-subjects, the enjoyment of those equal rights which they claimed for themselves; and it must be admitted, that some Dissenters were not free from old anti-catholic principles; but these prejudices were now fast disappearing. The House had received many petitions for the repeal of all civil disabilities, on account of religious belief. The Corporation act was yet very generally acted on, to the exclusion of Dissenters. This was, in some respects, a privilege rather than a penalty to the person excluded, who could decline to serve a troublesome office, without being subject to any fine for not serving it, which others would be subject to. But the act was here injurious to the public interest, by limiting the choice to a smaller number, and excluding men who might be most competent to fulfil the duties of a useful office. It was also highly injurious to the public interest, by keeping up that intolerant party-spirit, for which some corporations were so remarkable.</membercontribution></p>

<col>703</col>
mately involved, that I make no further excuse than to acknowledge my incapacity to do justice to the great cause in which I find myself engaged.<lb/>
That a state should be placed in such a situation as to be obliged, for whatever reasons, and under whatever circumstances, to renounce the services of a considerable part of its subjects, ought ever to be esteemed a matter of serious regret; but when those causes which gave rise to a necessity have ceased to operate&#x2014;when those circumstances have been changed by the lapse of time&#x2014;then that exclusion which state policy originally might have justified, becomes little less than a tyranny, and an arbitrary interference with the sacred and equal rights of mankind.<lb/>
If I were inclined to trace this exclusive policy to any other feeling than to that common vulgar feeling which actuates men to monopolize to themselves, and to a small circle around them, the honours and emoluments of the world; were it necessary to trace it to any other principle than to that principle by which the strong are universally found to oppress the weak, I might ascribe it to the prevalence of a system, or rather to the abuse of a system, which has grown out of a supposed alliance, between the Church and the State. Now, Sir, according to my view of this subject, I cannot conceive two things, the origin of which is more distinct, and the purpose of which ought to be more dissimilar, than Religion and the Civil government. And yet by this system, we are taught to blend' and to confound them together. We are taught to clothe the State with the sacred mantle of Religion, and to ascribe to it a character and attributes which cannot be said to belong to it: and we are taught to look upon religion as the mere handmaid of the government, itself a constituent part and estate of the realm, and we end by worshiping it as an engine in the hands of the civil power, and as the stepping-stone to individual ambition. Not that I am ready broadly to assert that, under no assignable circumstances, a state can be justified in making religious distinction the ground of civil disability. I am not prepared to say that our ancestors have universally been wrong in making religious faith the criterion by which to judge of loyalty and attachment to the state. But then this great distinction ought never to be lost sight of; namely, that these disabilities were im-
<col>704</col>
posed, not on account of the religious opinions of those who were their victims; not because this man believed in transubstantiation, or that held doctrines inconsistent with the national creed; but because there were certain feelings and political attachments supposed to be inherent in, and inseparable from, these religious professions. If you can prove that the Catholics of the present day are aiming at the subversion of our constitution, and are desirous of bringing back a race of kings, whose only pretension to the throne of these kingdoms was founded upon the shadowy claim of legitimacy, I own that they might fairly be looked upon as objects of suspicion. But then, the burthen of the proof rests with those who would deprive them of their rights as citizens. If you could prove that the Protestant Dissenters were plotting the overthrow of our establishments in church and state, I then&#x2014;as undoubtedly was the case in the century before the last&#x2014;should be obliged to confess that it would not be unjust or unfair to debar them from all offices of trust and power. But then another consideration would present itself: I should ask, do they possess the means, the physical power, to carry their designs into effect? for it would be absurd in us to enact new laws, or what, in fact, is the same thing, to continue laws already existing, in order to suppress mere abstract opinions&#x2014;opinions not demonstrated by any overt act. But, were I even to allow, for the sake of argument, that these evil dispositions did exist in conjunction with the means of giving them effect; and here I must be understood, as admitting that proposition for the sake of argument only; for I do not think that there exists a body of men more loyal and more attached to the constitutional liberties of the country, then the Protestant Dissenters&#x2014;then would come before us this great question, and then only would it be necessary to entertain it, for where there is no danger, there is no need of security&#x2014;whether the laws as they now stand, whether the Test and Corporation acts, and the other restrictive laws, are adapted to furnish that security, and to ward off the danger which, under that supposition, might be said to impend over us.<lb/>
Now, Sir, I think it might easily be shown, that of all the laws that could be devised, these are the least calculated to effect the purpose which they profess to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0360"/>
<col>705</col>
have in view. And this for two reasons:&#x2014;In the first place, a man may be a very good and regular communicant with the Church of England, and yet entertain ideas very hostile to the liberties and the constitution of his country. Let me cite the example of the bishops who, in the reign of Charles the 2nd, all, with the exception of three, voted against the Bill of Exclusion; and the same bishops did, in the succeeding reign, unanimously oppose the Revolution and the establishment of king William. Thus, if these orthodox communicants had obtained their object, which was the permanency of their legitimate king, they would not only have destroyed the civil liberties of the state, but they would also have upset their own hierarchy, the preservation of which they owed, in great measure, to those very Dissenters whom, afterwards, they had the meanness to persecute.<lb/>
My second argument is one to which I think some favour ought to be shown in this House. And here, it must be confessed, that we have an advantage which rarely falls to any disputants; for we are not only supported by those who are usually called the friends of religious liberty, among whom may be reckoned some of the brightest characters of the age, but we have also the silent acquiescence, and the tacit consent of our opponents themselves; for, to what other principle of common sense can I reconcile it, that these gentlemen should come down to this House, year after year, and give their votes for the bill of Indemnity (which is. in fact a virtual repeal of those laws which they now pretend are essential as bulwarks to our establishments) unless they were in their own minds intimately convinced of their utter inutility and worthlessness.<lb/>
Were it necessary for me to go into the historical part of this question, I think it could easily be shown, that the Test act was enacted as a check upon the royal power, at a time when the king could not be intrusted with the nomination of his own servants. Strange it is, that it should now be supported under a monarch of a different character, and upheld, too, by gentlemen who have lately derived so much benefit from the free exercise of this prerogative; I think, too, it could easily be shown, that the Test act was intended to control the Catholics; for its immediate consequence was the deprivation of lord treasurer Clifford, who was one of the
<col>706</col>
most powerful and dangerous of that body, and to compel the resignation of the duke of York, (which in fact was its real object), who then held the office of high admiral.<lb/>
But I should ill requite the indulgence which the House seems inclined to extend to me, were I unnecessarily to take up any considerable portion of its time, and I should give but a poor specimen of ray discretion upon the first time of addressing it, were I to enter upon a field which has been already occupied with so much ability by the noble lord who has preceded me. I shall, therefore, confine myself to make a few remarks upon the most obvious and prominent of those objections which have usually been made to the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts. In the first place, I must take notice of that argument by which it is pretended, that, in consequence of the annual act of Indemnity, these laws are rather an imaginary, than a real, grievance. Now, I must say that it is a singular mode of defending any body of laws, to say that they are only made tolerable by their constant and systematic infraction. But it must be recollected, that a bill of Indemnity, however useful for the service of the state, and to protect even members of the church from the penal effects of those statutes, is but a temporary concession, it is a licence granted; it is not a liberty recognised; on the contrary, it recognises that false and vicious principle of government, by which the stronger are allowed to suppress and exclude the weaker portion of the community on account of their religious opinions. But I deny that they can be esteemed merely imaginary grievances. What&#x0021; is it no grievance for an Englishman to hold his liberties by an annual lease only? Is it no hardship to hold his rights by such a precarious tenure? Is it no grievance to be subject to the caprice of any one branch of the legislature, and to owe it to their forbearance only that he is not crushed by the weight of the penalties attached to these laws? Are these no grievances?<lb/>
And here I must generally remark, that the evil of exclusive, and restrictive, laws does not consist so much in the actual deprivation of place and power to those who are their victims, as in the stigma which they cast upon them, as in the degradation into which they undeservedly plunge them, and in the insolent superiority with which they awe their opponents.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0361"/>
<col>707</col>
In the same strain of reasoning, it is attempted to be shown that the Protestant Dissenters are indifferent to their present situation, and consequently to the repeal of these acts. Now, Sir, I should have thought that the petitions laid upon your table, if not unequalled in numerical quantity, but such as have been rarely surpassed by liberality of sentiment and in unity of purpose, would have been a sufficient answer to this objection; but if there had not been a single petition laid upon your table, I still must have argued, that no Englishman could have sat down contentedly under such a deprivation of his rights; and if that argument were true, as applied to Englishmen in general, with how much greater force must it not come when it refers to a body of men not the worst educated in the community, and who have ever shown themselves the friends to the liberties of their country; at times, too, when those liberties were forgotten and perhaps betrayed by churchmen?<lb/>
There are some gentlemen who are unwilling to repeal these acts because they say, they know not what will be the next concession required of them. This is a singular argument. What will you refuse that which is proper, because you may perhaps be asked for what is unreasonable? Will you refuse to pay a just debt, because your creditor may afterwards be induced to commit a robbery upon you? I know not what may be the ultimate object of the sectaries: I am not in the confidence of their committees or associations. I know them only by the casual intercourse of society; but this I know, that were I a Dissenter, I should never cease to knock at the doors of the constitution till they were thrown widely open to me; and I should never cease to raise my voice until I was placed upon a perfect equality with the rest of my fellow-countrymen.<lb/>
Now, let it not be inferred from any thing I have said this night, or, if I may take the liberty of saying so, from any thing that has fallen from the noble lord below me, that we are hostile to, or indifferent to, the interests of the church. Whatever might be my opinion upon a review of the abstract question, I have no hesitation in declaring, that in this country an establishment is essential for the preservation of order, morality, and religion. I wish to see an establishment high and respected; respected from its own conduct,
<col>708</col>
and respectable from its situation; but I wish to see it stand on any other ground than on the narrow basis of exclusion. I wish to see it rely upon any other prop than upon the feeble one of persecution. Let others, if they please, shew their zeal for the Establishment, by supporting it with arguments connected with intolerance. I will shew mine by endeavouring to wipe off those blots that deface it, and which are at once derogatory to its honour, its interests, and its strength.<lb/>
These Sir, are the principle reasons, however imperfectly expressed, which have induced me this night to come forward in support of the motion of the noble lord. What will be the conduct of those gentlemen who have uniformly shown themselves averse to make any concessions to the sectaries, it is not difficult for me to anticipate. But there are some honourable gentlemen, I am told, who are friendly to the Catholic question, and who now refuse to listen to the prayer of their Protestant brethren. How they are to reconcile this to their professions of liberality, it is for them to explain. From all that has fallen from me this night, it cannot be doubtful to those who have done me the honour to listen to me, that I must be a friend to that great cause, whether as regarding the peculiar interests of Ireland, or rather with reference to the great principles of general toleration. But I have yet to learn how the liberation of one body of men is to be effected by rivetting the chains of another. On the contrary, I think that every step we make this night will be in favour of Ireland&#x2014;every advance we make for the relief of the Dissenters will be so much gained in the great cause of Catholic emancipation. Break but once through the line of bigotry and prejudice, and the victory is our own.<lb/>
I must now call the attention of the House to a part of this subject which I own I approach with something like fear and reverence, but one which I trust will never be deemed incompatible with the duties, nor alien from the feelings, of a British House of Commons. That there is a religion of an origin and character infinitely more sacred than those which I must call human establishments in the world, and which are, in fact, but forms, and modifications of this original religion, is a truth which will hardly be disputed by the warmest advocate for Church and State. If, then, there is such a religion as the one
<image src="S2V0018P0I0362"/>
<col>709</col>
which I have described, the common source, and mother of all the different sects which diversify the Christian world, something to which we ought all to appeal, amidst our differences and our discords, our sects and our systems, I should be glad to know from any candid professor of that holy religion, whose ideas are not too far secularized by a connection with the state, how that can be useful to the offspring, which is hurtful to the parent; how that can be advantageous to the Church of England, which is destructive to Christianity itself.&#x2014;I would further wish to ask him, whether he thinks that it can be deemed conformable to the principles of that religion to make that ceremony which ought to be the bond of union and affection among mankind, the very ground and symbol of their differences. I would ask him, whether it be pious to make the holiest rite that can subsist between man and his Creator the stepping-stone of ambition, of avarice and of vanity&#x2014;whether it be decent
<quote>"To make the symbol of atoning grace,</quote>
<quote>An office key, the pick-lock of a place."</quote>
It has been said, in opposition to this view of the question, that there is no greater objection to make the sacrament the test of civil qualification, than to make an oath the test of truth. Whatever apparent resemblance there may be between these two cases, on further examination we shall find that there is no analogy whatever between them, and that no common inference is to be drawn from them. An oath is the best possible mode of securing the truth, and well adapted for the purposes of its institution. I do not mean to say but that by our present system of legislation, oaths have been so much multiplied as to render them in many instances inefficacious, but they could not have been appointed for any other object than for the adjustment of human differences. Will any one pretend that this was the object of the ordination of the holy sacrament, or that it is not a profanation of its purpose to convert it to the uses to which it is daily applied? If we must persecute, if we must indulge that wicked instinct of our nature, let us, in God's name, refrain from the use of such means and of such an instrument as ought at least to be secure from such unholy contamination.<lb/>
Considering, then, this question not merely as one designed to relieve a great and deserving body of his majesty's sub-
<col>710</col>
jects, but regarding it as equally interesting to all Christians and as a step in the great career of religious liberty, I will give my most zealous support to the motion of the noble lord. In giving that vote I trust that I shall this night have the happiness to see a decisive blow given to that system of laws, which has long been the reproach of this country and a disgrace to the enlightened age in which we live&#x2014;a system of laws useless for any good purpose, impotent to protect, to defend or to save&#x2014;powerful only to irritate, to harass and oppress, and which, in point of fact, has a devout tendency to produce the very evil, and to create the danger, which it affects to control.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00529"><member>Sir R. H. Inglis</member><membercontribution> rose and said:&#x2014;<lb/>
I approach, Sir, the consideration of this great question with the same distrust of myself, but with the same confidence in my cause, which, on his part, the noble lord&#x2014;my noble friend, if I may so call him&#x2014;has felt and expressed in submitting his motion to you. I shall be very happy, if I can carry to the discussion of it the same talent and temper which he has displayed.<lb/>
Sir, in the history of the acts in question, and in the history of the attempts successively made to repeal them, I am, not disposed to differ much from my noble friend; except that I do not think that he has quite done justice to the character and earnestness of Walpole in pursuit of the same object which he himself has now in view; since Walpole was clearly hot content to rest in the failure of his first endeavours to procure the repeal of them, but renewed those endeavours in the year 1736, and quarrelled with one who, oh other points, had been among his greatest supporters, because, in this instance, he opposed him. This, however, is a minor I point, which it is scarcely necessary to notice.<lb/>
I proceed, then, at once, to the consideration of the real question: Are the restrictions, the repeal of which is now required, restrictions on the natural rights of man? The passage in the noble lord's speech, in which he insisted on this position, was much cheered by the House, or rather by those who sat more immediately around him; and, in fact, it is on this ground that much of what we hear elsewhere, or see in the petitions, much of; what the noble lord, much of what the hon. gentleman who last addressed you,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0363"/>
<col>711</col>
have urged, mainly rests. On this ground, therefore, I will first meet the question. Let me say, in the first instance, that, on this, as on a somewhat similar subject, I should feel ashamed to resist, on the mere ground of expediency, a claim which any man, or any body of men, could urge as a matter of right and justice. It is because I do not see any such right or justice in the present case, that I resist the motion of my noble friend. Sir, the question of power is one of pure unmixed expediency: no man has an abstract right to it: power, as Burke has stated it, is the creature of society: when once established, indeed, its sanctions are from a higher source: but, in the beginning it is not like the right of life, or of liberty, original and absolute, but it is the arbitrary and artificial arrangement of men, modified and distributed in different ages and countries in every possible variety of combination. No one can, by nature, independently of the conventions of society, claim a right to govern his fellow men. The question, therefore, whether any man or any body of men, ought to be eligible to power is a question of pure expediency, not of justice; and such power may be regulated by sex, by age, by property, or by opinions, without any wrong to any one's natural claims. Sir, it is the highest right, and the first duty of every man, to worship God according to his own conscience; and God forbid that any man should be compelled to worship in one way, or be prohibited from worshipping in another, by any despotism of society: but I repeat it, a man's opinions may just as reasonably as the measure of his property exclude him from power: and, therefore, the question is still left one of mere policy, upon which men equally conscientious may well arrive at different conclusions.<lb/>
Some established opinions every government, in every age, and in every country, with one single and late exception, has recognized and enforced. Some established form of religion there has ever been in every other civilized state:&#x2014;all reason, all experience, all history, ancient and modern, the United States of America alone excepted, justify such a measure on the part of every government. Now, the very idea of an authorized religion implies some preference. I cannot conceive how an establishment can exist without some special protection and preference. The ques-
<col>712</col>
tion then follows, what preference of those belonging to that establishment, what exclusion of others, may be necessary to its preservation? I am very willing to admit that the least degree of exclusion, the lightest restraint, which can meet and satisfy that object ought to be imposed. But some exclusion, some restraint, is inseparable from the idea of the public and. recognized establishment of a Church. The question, in the present case, is not&#x2014;let it ever be recollected&#x2014;whether this connexion of church and state be or be not desirable in the abstract: with us that question is already decided. We are not legislating for a new country; we are not forming a constitution for New Zealand. We possess a church establishment inseparably connected with our state: and that establishment and that union we are bound to maintain:
<quote><i>Spartam nactus es, hanc orna.</i></quote>
I am to consider, then, whether, in the view of preserving the Church, more grievous restraints are imposed on those who dissent from it, than the necessity of the case requires. And here I cannot but remark the extraordinary fact, that, for thirty-six or thirty-seven years there has hardly been uttered one complaint to parliament on the subject of these restraints. It is true, that they now occupy a very considerable space in the petitions upon the table: but I cannot help thinking, that the silence, with which they had been treated for more than an entire generation, is a strong proof, that practically the grievances are not so great as for the purposes of argument they are represented. The substance of those grievances is embodied in a statement industriously circulated, called the "Case of the Dissenters;" and here I was surprised to observe, that the last rejection of their claims which is therein noticed is described as carried by only twenty against them; leaving an inference as if this House were nearly divided in opinion when the question last came before them: but what was the fact? The division stated took place, indeed, in 1789, but in 1790 the question was again brought before the House; and was lost by a division of two hundred and ninety to one hundred and five, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Burke voting in the majority.<lb/>
To return to the point. The silence of the Dissenters since that time may safely be considered as a proof, that the griev-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0364"/>
<col>713</col>
ances under the Test and Corporation Laws were not much felt; were not, in degree, so excessive as they are now described to be.<lb/>
I come, then, to the mode, the particular Test, applied by these Laws for the purpose of securing the Church. And here let me say, that those who object to the mode, and who do not profess to object to the purpose, ought perhaps themselves to propose a substitute. I will, however, consider the Test actually adopted, I own, that I think bishop Sherlock's defence of it is in theory, at least, unanswerable. Receiving the Sacrament is not the qualification; but the evidence of qualification, namely, the evidence of being a member of the Church of England. The Church requires all her members to receive the Holy Communion three times every year; and the law requires only, that you should give evidence of having done that which your own Church has already required you to do, whether you take office, or not: the constitution assuming that you are a member of the Church, or, at least, not so hostile to it, as to refuse communion with it.<lb/>
As to the profanation of the rite, I thank my noble friend for the manner in which he treated this part of the subject. In the tone of his reference to it, he has set us all an example which I take the liberty of saying we shall all do well to imitate. Profanation is not necessarily, I hope not frequently, connected with this test: at any rate the abuse is not in itself an argument against such a test, any more than perjury is an argument against oaths. In practice, the test is seldom enforced. It has been repealed by law in respect to the more numerous classes to which it once applied; and in respect to others, is covered by the act of indemnity. In a county with which the noble lord and I are particularly connected, the whole number of persons who have qualified since the accession of the present king is only twenty-three. I speak of the county only, and not of the corporation. That number includes all members of the Church of England of course: whether any persons of the twenty-three felt it to be a violation of their consciences to take the sacrament according to the Church of England, I have no means of knowing; but the whole number is so small, as to prove, at any rate, how little the evil can be, in that quarter at least.&#x2014;In fact, the act of indemnity relieves all scruples, as well as
<col>714</col>
all neglects. The original laws are kept in existence, to be enforced only when some great necessity shall arise: no one wishes to enforce them on the one side; and no great body of men, I should have thought, felt them a grievance on the other. They are at the same time the power which the constitution of England keeps in her own hand to protect the Church and herself, whenever such a combination of circumstances shall again arise as that which, two centuries ago, overthrew the altar and the throne, the Church and the State, in one common destruction.<lb/>
Against the recurrence of these dangers the laws in question were framed. Something has been said by the noble lord, and still more by the hon. member who seconded the motion, and something also by the hon. gentleman who has just set down, on the "wisdom of our ancestors;" a topic often introduced, on late occasions, with a sneer. It seems, indeed, the best, because it is the most frequent, joke of those who use it. Now, Sir, I am willing to admit, that, in physical science, new and improved views are every day opening on mankind: but in moral science, and even in the arts of governing men, I am yet to learn that we are superior to our ancestors. The foundations of all moral truth were laid in a revelation not of yesterday. The principles of political government are to be found in the great authors of antiquity. No where can you find more intimate knowledge of human nature in society, than in the ten first books of Livy, in Tacitus, and in Thucydides; and in respect to the Institutions of our own country, I am content with the principles of the constitution, as established at the Revolution. I do not desire to be a better Whig than lord Somers; and I am surprised at the way in which the descendants of his great associates speak of the wisdom which established the safeguards of our present constitution.<lb/>
The Dissenters of the present day enjoy the fullest rights of conscience: and I am willing to admit that there is nothing in their overt acts from which I apprehend any danger. With some of them I am intimate, for many more I have the highest respect; but it is perfectly clear, that the principles of Dissenters conscientiously opposed to the Church, can never give the same undivided allegi-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0365"/>
<col>715</col>
ance to the constitution in church and state which a churchman does. The principles, if carried to the same extent as formerly, would produce the same results. The laws which restrain Dissenters are, and will ever be, left inoperative, so long as those principles slumber also: but I think that they should be retained for the purpose of being exerted in extreme cases, if such should ever arise. In fact, a richly-endowed Church, with all its privileges and immunities, will always be an object of jealousy to those who differ from it: but, connected as it is with the constitution, the state is bound to protect it against any dangers from any quarters. Dangers will always exist: and, if the present disabilities were removed, and Dissenters placed on the fullest equality as to power with the Church, some new question, perhaps of property, would immediately be started, on which new struggles and new dangers would arise. The question of tythes would probably come: and, as we should have followed the example of America in giving no preference to any Church, we should be called upon to follow it further, and to enact that no man should pay any thing to any pastor but his own [hear, hear]. I accept the cheer of the hon. member for Montrose as a proof that my inference is correct; that there are those who would go so far.&#x2014;No, Sir, differences must always exist; and the removal of the present matter of grievance will only bring the discontent one step nearer. I therefore prefer that the contest shall still continue about the out-works, and that we should not surrender them, because I am too sure that, in that case, we should have to fight for the citadel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00530"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> said, that, during the greater part of the speech of the hon. baronet, who had just sat down, he had reckoned on his vote in favour of the motion of the noble lord; for he had not thought it possible, until the hon. member had so declared it, that setting out as he did by laying it down as a principle, that the question was one of political expediency, and admitting that the least possible restriction should be put upon the Protestant Dissenters, that was consistent with the public security, and the protection which was due to the religion of the state, the hon. baronet should come to the conclusion, that the Dissenters ought to be
<col>716</col>
excluded by law from all offices in the state, civil and military.<lb/>
The hon. baronet had taken for granted two material points that remained to be proved: first, that our constitution, in church and state, required protection; and, secondly, that such protection would be afforded to it by the exclusion in question. The hon. baronet had, indeed, said, that although he would not consent to the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts, he did not object, in ordinary times, to the passing of the act of Indemnity, by the provisions of which the Dissenters were protected from the penalties of the law; but that to guard against the recurrence of events, which in former times had overwhelmed both church and state, it was necessary and fit, that the power should be retained to put the law in execution, when a change of circumstances might require it. This, then, was the boasted indemnity of the Dissenter, that he was to be safe from those dreadful penalties, only as long as the dominant party in the state should be of opinion that the enforcing of those penalties was not necessary for their own security. See the situation of the Dissenter, who was told by some of those who oppposed his claims, that he suffered no practical grievance, for that he was, and would continue to be, protected by the act of Indemnity, annually renewed; whilst others, of which number was the hon. baronet, told him, that the protection of him (the Dissenter) depended on this&#x2014;whether or not the ruling power should at any time consider, that the conduct, not of the individual himself, but of his party, continued to be such as to entitle him to indemnity, or subject him to punishment.<lb/>
The hon. baronet had said, that it was extraordinary, if the Protestant Dissenters had any practical grievance to complain of, that their voices had not been heard within the walls of that House for the space of thirty-seven years. But under what circumstances was it, that the Dissenters had ceased to urge their claims before that House and the public. In the years 1787, 1789, and 1790, they on three different occasions attempted to awaken the legislature to a sense of the justice of their claim. On Mr. Beaufoy's second motion in May, 1789, the question was lost by a small majority, 22 only; but on Mr. Fox's motion, in March, 1790, the majority had increased to 189. Important events had occurred in the interval
<image src="S2V0018P0I0366"/>
<col>717</col>
between these two motions.<sup>*</sup> On the latter occasion all the artillery of Mr. Burke's eloquence was brought into the field. The example of the French revolution was held out as a warning against innovation; and all the topics connected with that event were brought in aid, and enforced with all the powers of oratory possessed by that extraordinary man. It was certain that the overwhelming majority on that occasion was obtained, not on the merits of the case, but on extrinsic circumstances, which were attempted too successfully to be associated with it. But the hopes of the Dissenters for the time were extinguished. A period of alarm ensued; and amidst the terror and dismay which spread itself over the land, and which it required years to dispel, what chance was there of redress for the Protestant Dissenters? It would have been wholly useless for the Dissenters to have brought forward their claims at such a period. It would have been, perhaps, worse than useless. It might have embarrassed and weakened the government at a time when its whole strength was required to meet the exigencies of that troubled period. It might be said, that the Dissenters had prolonged their silence far beyond that period; and it was true, that for very many years, they had not approached that House with their complaints; but were their just application to be refused for no other reason but because they had failed in importunity? The question was not, how long they had been passive under their sufferings. It mattered not whether it was thirty-seven, or fifty, or a hundred years. The question was, whether they had grievances to complain of, not how long they had consented to be silent under them. If they had real cause of complaint, there was but one course to be taken by a just and wise government, which was, to remove it.<lb/>
This was the object of the motion of the noble lord, who bore a name worthy to be associated with the consideration of any question in which the liberties of the people of England were concerned. He had listened with unmixed satisfaction to the speech of that noble lord, whose talents enabled him to do so much justice to the cause of which he was the advocate. He had left little or nothing to be said by those who were to follow him in the debate. He (Mr. F.) would, therefore,
<quote><sup>*</sup> Parl. Hist., vol. xxviii, pp. 1, 387.</quote>
<col>718</col>
touch shortly on the principal topics which this discussion necessarily involved.<lb/>
First, as to the history of these acts. The Test act, it was clear, was levelled at the Roman Catholics alone. He admitted that the Corporation act, the first in point of time, was not passed with any reference to the Roman Catholics; nor was it intended to guard so much against the Presbyterian, as against the republican, sectaries, who had overturned both church and monarchy, and had driven the Presbyterians themselves out of the field. It was necessary, indeed, by the act, to take the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the usage of the Church of England; but the Presbyterians did not at that time refuse to communicate with the Church of England. It was the act of Uniformity which produced the final separation between the two religions. The Sacramental Test was not the only evidence of qualification which the Corporation act required. No declaration, indeed, was required against transubstantiation, as nothing probably at that early period after the Restoration was feared from the Roman Catholics; but political tests were required by the Corporation act. It was required, that the person admitted should testify by oath, that it was unlawful, under any pretence, to take up arms against the king, and by declaration that the solemn league and covenant was unlawful and not binding. In short, it would be found that the provisions both of the Corporation and Test acts, were intended as the probes by means of which the political principles of the party were to be got at; partly, no doubt, and in the latter act principally, by ascertaining his religious creed, which was supposed to be the evidence or test of his political principles. The Test act, which was not passed till eleven years after the Corporation act, was evidently intended to meet the dangers of a political crisis which threatened the subversion of the constitutional liberties of England. It was levelled against the Catholics, not as a religious, but a political, sect, at the head of which was the duke of York, and even the king himself, who aimed at the introduction of arbitrary rule, by assuming a power to dispense with the law, and who, although he had recalled his Declation of Indulgence, was still prepared to carry into execution his plan for establishing arbitrary power through the means of an army commanded by popish officers,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0367"/>
<col>719</col>
stationed almost at the gates of London. Churchmen and Dissenters joined to avert the impending calamity, and the Test act was passed, which compelled the duke of York and the popish officers to resign their employments, the Dissenters themselves submitting, for the public safety, to the disabilities to which they themselves became subject by the operation of the law.<lb/>
Let the House judge how that body had been requited for this act of self-devotion. Although the parliament which passed the Test act appeared to be sensible of the merits of the Protestant Dissenters, and a bill for their relief had actually passed both Houses, it was lost, by the prorogation of parliament, as some state, or by the clandestine removal of it, as others say, from the table of the House of Lords, by the order or with the privity of the king. It was admitted by all, that the Test act was not passed at the time to meet any danger that was apprehended from the Protestant Dissenters; and yet it was argued, that it "was now necessary to preserve its enactments for the security both of church and state. As to the security of the state, when (Mr. Fergusson asked) had it been endangered by the conduct of the Protestant Dissenters? Who would venture to put the question upon that issue&#x2014;upon the loyalty or disloyalty of that body? Had any class of his majesty's subjects ever given more striking, more efficient, or more generous, proofs of their attachment to their sovereign and to the constitution of their country, than the Protestant Dissenters? No prince of the house of Brunswick could ever, he was assured, be insensible to the claims which the Protestant Dissenters had to his protection and favour&#x2014;he would add, to his gratitude. It was matter of history, almost of recollection, that when the crown and person of the then reigning prince of that illustrious family were both in peril, when the armies of the state had been defeated; when the pretender to the throne was advancing with his victorious troops into the very centre of the kingdom, sweeping the west of England, and carrying in his train numerous and powerful adherents, of the first families of the land; when the fidelity of too many of the members of the Church of England was shaken, what was the conduct of the Protestant Dissenters? Not one Dissenter was known to have joined the rebel force. Nay, in the face of those dreadful penalties that awaited them, they
<col>720</col>
flew to arms in defence of their sovereign and of their country; and by their courage and conduct in the field, contributed largely to the happy, but once doubtful, issue of that great contest.&#x2014;What was the result, as far as respected the fate of the parties who had been engaged in that struggle?&#x2014;One might imagine such an inquiry to have been made in foreign countries, where it might have been asked, What became of the rebellious subjects of the king, who had thus failed in their attempt upon his crown and life? A few were executed for the sake of example, and the rest were pardoned.&#x2014;What became of those men, who so nobly and generously, and at so much hazard, had defended with their arms the person and authority of their king? They were pardoned too&#x0021;&#x2014;And how pardoned? Pardoned for an act of loyalty, but left subject for the future to the same penalties which the law denounced against a similar act of self-devotion.<lb/>
The hon. member said, he would now turn more particularly to that portion of Dissenters, who were so only because they were members of their own national established church&#x2014;the Church of Scotland. They were equally with the English Dissenters excluded from office and employment. They could not by law hold commissions in the army or navy&#x2014;not the army and navy of England alone&#x2014;but the army and navy of Scotland as much as of England&#x2014;the army and navy of Great Britain&#x2014;the army and navy which formed the defence of their common country, and to the expense of which they contributed in common. By law they were excluded, unless they renounced their faith, and excluded under the severest penalties. That they served their country, at the risk of those penalties, and served it effectually, was well known. Scotland had taken at all times her full share, if not more than her share, of the danger and the glory which attended the service of the country. In the field of Waterloo, where the question of the independence, not of Britain only, but of Europe and the world, was to be decided, who could tell what would have been its fate, even under the immortal leader of that day, had no arms been uplifted in its defence, but those of the sons of the Church of England&#x2014;had the 42nd regiment, and the Scotch Greys, and the; numerous officers and soldiers, natives of Scotland, who fought on that day&#x2014;had&#x0021; the brave Irish too, the proscribed Catho-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0368"/>
<col>721</col>
lics, been withdrawn from that glorious but deadly contest? If they had the assistance of such men in the hour of peril, ought they not to conciliate them in a time of security and peace? Did they believe, that the services of the members of the Church of England were sufficient for the defence of the country? If so, let the Dissenters of all descriptions withdraw themselves from a service which was imputed to them as a crime; and let the government then see, whether it would be in their power to wage another war?<lb/>
By the enactments complained of, the majority of the population of the three kingdoms&#x2014;for such were the Dissenters of England, of Ireland, and of Scotland&#x2014;were excluded from the service of the State, unless they renounced their faith, or became offenders against that law, and criminals subject to the severest penalties, In respect of the exclusion of the members of the Church of Scotland, it was the proscription of a whole nation. It was the exclusion by law from the service of the State, of every member of the religion of the State. The Presbyterian religion was as much the established religion of the State, as the religion professed by the members of the Church of England. It was so declared by law, and secured by solemn national compact, the Union between the two kingdoms. Upon that occasion Scotland&#x2014;an ancient kingdom&#x2014;the more ancient of the two;&#x2014;treated with England upon an equal footing. Previously to the Union, the parliament of Scotland passed an act "for securing the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian church government within the kingdom of Scotland." By the act, after reciting that, by a former act, it was provided that the commissioners for the treaty of Union between the kingdoms should not treat of or concerning any alteration of the Scotch discipline or government of the Church of Scotland, it was enacted that the Presbyterian church government and discipline, should remain and continue unalterable, and be the only government of the Church within the kingdom of Scotland. The parliament of England in like manner passed an act for securing the Church of England as by law established, containing a similar prohibition to the commissioners from treating of any alteration in the liturgy, rights, ceremonies, discipline or government of the Church of England as by law established, and confirming and securing
<col>722</col>
the same, each of those acts providing, that they should be inserted in any treaty of Union to be concluded between the two countries; and they were accordingly inserted in the articles of Union, and were thereby declared to be essential and fundamental conditions of the said Union. Yet the members of one of their national and established churches could not serve their common sovereign and their common country without incurring those dreadful penalties. He did not, however, wish to put the claims of the members of the Church of Scotland on higher ground than the claims of other Protestant Dissenters from the Church of England. He wished to rest the case of both on the same broad ground of religious liberty. He would ask&#x2014;he had almost said, he would take&#x2014;nothing for his countrymen, which was not communicated to others who were suffering for the same cause.<lb/>
He could not for a moment think that the continuance of such a law as that which was complained of could be necessary for the preservation of the Church of England. It was not found necessary for the preservation of the Church of Scotland, nor for the preservation of the Church of Ireland. He (Mr. Fergusson) was a member of an established church. His opinion was favourable to a national church establishment. He thought it was best fitted to the state of society in which they lived. A liberal provision should be made for the maintenance of the clergy, who should not be obliged to look to contribution for their support. They ought to live independent and respected; and they ought to have ample means for that purpose. They would, he feared, be reduced to a miserable state if "they were compelled to trust to the contributions of the faithful." If every man were to pay his own clergy, according to the plan of the hon. member for Aberdeen, he did not know what was the clergy which that hon. member would pay. He (Mr. Fergusson) was for up-holding the Church of England&#x2014;indeed, he, as one of the members for Scotland was bound to uphold the Church of England by the terms of the Union between his own country and this, whose members were in like manner bound to uphold the Church of Scotland.&#x2014;To admit the members of the Church of Scotland, and the general body of Dissenters, to the same rights as the members of the Church of England, to free them from the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0369"/>
<col>723</col>
penalties to which they were now subject for exercising those rights, could not in any manner affect the stability of the Church of England. The Church of England was safe in her privileges and immunities. She was safe in the enjoyment of her property. She held it under the sanction of the law&#x2014;the same law under which the property of every member of that House was holden and no other. Was it to be supposed, for one moment, that the Dissenters entertained the insane project of possessing themselves of the property of the Church? On what ground could any hope rest of disturbing that property? If such fears were entertained of the Dissenters, why were they allowed by law to sit in that House? The very idea of such a danger, if any such was ever apprehended, was preposterous; and he could not believe, that any who might affect to entertain such apprehensions could be sincere. Let the House remember, to whom the spoils of the church had at all times fallen. If the Church of England was ever to be despoiled, it would not be by a religious sect, but by the hand of power. He believed, that that property was as safe as any other, and that nothing could shake its stability, that did not affect the security of all other property in the state.<lb/>
The hon. gentleman said, he would now proceed to another, and distinct part of the case. The House had been told, and it had been relied upon as a complete answer to all the arguments for the repeal of the Corporation and Test acts, that the Dissenters suffered no practical grievance, for that by the acts of Indemnity, which were passed annually, they were saved and protected from all penalties and forfeitures for having omitted to do, what the acts, under those penalties enjoined that they should do; namely, to take the oaths and make the declaration required by the acts, and also to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the rites and usage of the Church of England. He would take leave, with the permission of the House, to consider, in the first place, what was the nature and the extent of this indemnity. Honourable gentlemen might suppose that it was in the nature of a free pardon or act of grace for the offence which had been committed. It was no such thing. It was an indemnity upon a condition&#x2014;and that condition, was, to do the very thing which the Dissenter could not do, according to the principles
<col>724</col>
of his religion&#x2014;and the not doing of which was the reason why he required an indemnity or pardon. Yet the Dissenter, unless he did that very thing, was never pardoned. The indemnity never did or could take effect, until the Dissenter received the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the usage of the Church of England. Let it be observed too, that the indemnity, such as it was, was in its turn an indemnity for the past and not for the future. It seemed to be confined to persons who <i>at</i> or <i>before</i> the passing of the act had or should have omitted to qualify, that is, persons who at the time of the passing of the act of Indemnity held offices which required them to qualify, and had omitted so to do. He did not see how the words or the spirit of the act could properly be held to extend to persons who should be appointed to offices after the passing of the act, and should be guilty of the omission. He would not pretend to say, whether, if a person were appointed to an office immediately after the passing of the act, and be allowed the six months to elapse without qualifying, an informer might not commence proceedings against him, and proceed to judgment before the next act might pass, in which case there was no indemnity; as it was expressly provided, that it should not extend to persons against whom judgment had been obtained.<lb/>
There was another question of importance. What was the sort of omission which the act referred to? The words were "should have omitted <i>as aforesaid;</i>" and, in referring to the preamble, they would find that the persons who were to be indemnified "as aforesaid," were those who, "through ignorance of the law, absence, or some unavoidable accident, shall have omitted" to qualify.<lb/>
It was the plain meaning of the act, that such persons, and such persons only, should be indemnified; and it was clear, that if the intention of the act were to be complied with, and the words just cited from the preamble were to be considered as embodied into the enacting part, no Dissenter who held an office without having complied with the provisions of the Test act, would be protected from its penalties, if his default had been wilful, and not occasioned by any of the causes enumerated in the preamble. The Dissenter, therefore, who year after year, should have continued to hold an office
<image src="S2V0018P0I0370"/>
<col>725</col>
without complying with the terms of the statute of Charles 2nd, was not likely to be able to plead any of the excuses mentioned in the act of Indemnity; and if not, he could not be saved by it, if its spirit and intention were to be followed.<lb/>
But, supposing as the law now stood, that the Dissenter was protected by the terms of the act of Indemnity, what answer could be made to a member of either House of Parliament, to one of the bench of bishops for instance, who, by way of amendment, when the bill of Indemnity should be in its progress through the other House, should, with a view to make the letter of the law conformable to its spirit, propose that the words "through ignorance of the law, absence, or some unavoidable accident," should be embodied into the enacting part of the bill. The proposition would not be an unreasonable one, if it were thought right to prevent the abuse of the law, which the wilful omission to take the sacrament had always been considered to be, and had been so admitted by Mr. Fox in former debates on the Test acts, agreeing in that respect with lord North, the most able defender, as Mr. Fox was the most able opponent, of the provisions of that law.<lb/>
He begged to call the attention of the House once more to the point, that the Dissenter was never pardoned unless he qualified; so that, if it should ever happen that the Indemnity act should not be renewed, a Dissenter, who had ceased to hold office for twenty years, would still be subject to the penalties of the law. Was it quite certain, that the Indemnity act would always be renewed? Might not one conceive times of party heat and violence, in which the sanction of some part or other of the legislature might be referred to the passing of this act? for, let it be remembered, that the Test and Corporation acts were existing laws, and, although it required the authority of king, lords, and commons, to suspend those acts, or to mitigate their severity, it required parliament only to be passive to leave them to their full operation; or, if the measure of relief should be attempted in parliament, it required only the authority of one branch of the legislature to prevent that relief. Other causes Gould be imagined that might prevent it. There might be an interregnum of the government, as there had been lately, which might stop the passing of the act. It
<col>726</col>
was known that a very few of the members of that House might delay considerably the passing of any act. They were then within twenty-eight days of the act of Indemnity expiring. The act might expire from any of the causes which he had enumerated; and every Dissenter who either held or had held an office, might be subjected to all the penalties which the law denounced against him. He might be told, that such fears were chimerical; for that which had been done for eighty years would continue to be done, and that there was not and ought not to be any apprehension whatever that the Dissenter would be left without protection. If this were the case, what became of the terror which was said to hang over the Dissenter lest the day might come when he was not to be indemnified, which was considered by some as a sort of security for his good behaviours But if a case could not be supposed, in which the legislature would refuse to protect the Dissenter by an indemnity; was there common sense in allowing the penalties to remain in the Statute-book for a single moment? Either the Dissenters had nothing whatever to fear from these penal enactments, and then they must cease to operate on their conduct altogether, or there was ground to apprehend that they might, some time or other, be brought into operation against them, and then the act of Indemnity was to the Dissenter not a protection but a snare. This was a dilemma, out of which he had never been able to see how the enemies of the repeal of I those penal acts could escape. It seemed also to be forgotten altogether, that one of those acts occasioned a real, substantial, practical, grievance, to the Dissenter, from which the act of Indemnity was not and could not be any protection to him whatever&#x2014;he meant the Corporation act. That act required, that the person chosen into office should within twelve "months before that time, have received the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the usage of the Church of England. It had been decided in the court of King's-bench, that where there were two candidates for a corporate office, one qualified by having taken the sacrament, the other not, and where the qualified candidate had given notice to the electors that the other was not qualified, and that the votes given to him would be thrown away, although the majority was in favour of the candidate who had not qualified, the candidate who had qualified,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0371"/>
<col>727</col>
was held with, the smaller number of votes to have been duly elected into the office. Could it be denied, then, that the provisions of the Corporation act operated so as to produce a direct positive disability in the conscientious Dissenter to be elected into any corporation?<lb/>
He had only one point more to touch upon, and he should do so very shortly. He referred to the public scandal that was produced by the profanation of the most sacred ordinance of the religion of Christ, to the purposes of worldly ambition, interest, or cupidity. Mr. Fox had supposed the case of a person advancing to the altar for the purpose of receiving the communion, and it being asked, "Is this man going to make his peace with God and repent him of his sins?" The answer would be&#x2014;No, he is only going to "qualify for the office of first lord of the Treasury." This profanation of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper for the purposes he had mentioned, was to be complained of by the members of the Church of England still more than the Dissenters; for it was the solemn rites of their church that were thus profaned.<lb/>
Before he sat down, he would address a few words to the members of the House, who had taken opposite sides on the great question of Catholic emancipation; he submitted to those who had voted, most conscientiously, he doubted not, against any further concessions to the Roman Catholics, that they might vote with perfect consistency for this measure of relief to their Protestant fellow-subjects: the repeal of the provisions respecting the sacramental test, did not weaken the security which the declaration against transubstantiation, and the oath of supremacy, still left as against the Roman Catholics. To those who had voted, as he had voted, for Catholic emancipation, he would say, that the cause of religious liberty, on which the foundation of their votes in favour of the Catholics could alone rest, was equally involved in the question then before the House. The questions differed only in degree. He would say with confidence, that no man, who upon principle, supported the cause of the Roman Catholics, could refuse his support to the cause of the Protestant Dissenters. He hoped and believed that the motion of the noble lord would receive support from all parties in that House; and, notwithstanding the formidable array which he saw opposed to him, he anticipated victory. He hoped
<col>728</col>
and believed that the cause of religious liberty would have that evening a signal triumph in the success of the motion of the noble lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00531"><member>Mr. Robert Palmer</member><membercontribution> said, that this was not a question of party, but one that should be decided on its own merits. Whether he had received a ministerial circular to attend or not, be would assure the hon. gentleman who had last spoken, that he should form his opinion on the question to the best of his ability, and give his vote as his conscience dictated. It had been conceded by every speaker, that the laws against the Dissenters were harsh in a high degree; but it was contended, that they were absolutely necessary to the safety of the church establishment. Again, it was said, that they were repealed every year by the operation of the Indemnity act; but that seemed to prove, on the other hand, that no necessity for them existed. He, however, certainly considered their existence no small grievance to the Dissenters. He was as much attached as any man could be to the church establishment, but he thought some better test might be devised than that of taking the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. As to the importance of this subject in the eyes of the Dissenters themselves, if the House judged of it by the enormous number of petitions laying on their table, they might fairly conclude that the Dissenters felt the grievance vitally, and, consequently, that it was one to which the House was bound to give its most mature consideration. Before he concluded, he could not avoid remarking the total absence of any petition in favour of the Test and Corporation acts. This was a sign that no great fear was entertained, on the part of those who had the greatest interest in the established church, that any mighty danger would arise from the repeal of those acts. He was anxious for it, as an act of kindness and conciliation, and he returned his thanks to the noble lord for the ability with which he had brought the question before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00532"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, he fully agreed with the noble mover in considering the imposition of religious tests, as the means of civil qualification, highly objectionable. He certainly regretted their existence upon the Statute-book, but he had likewise to express his regret, that, under the present circumstances of the country, and at the present time, the noble
<image src="S2V0018P0I0372"/>
<col>729</col>
lord thought proper to bring forward this motion [a laugh, mingled with cries of "Oh&#x0021;"] As soon as the noise had somewhat subsided, we understood the right hon. Secretary to beseech the indulgence of the House, and to express a hope that he should be allowed to explain the reasons which governed his conduct upon this occasion. He would repeat, then, that he regretted that, under the present circumstances, the noble lord had thought proper to introduce this motion. He was free to confess his objection to the Test and Corporation acts; but, after all that had occurred, he doubted whether the motion of the noble lord was calculated, or directed, to remove or to repress any urgent grievance. If, then, the motion was not directed to the cure of some urgent grievance, its agitation at present must militate against another and a more important question, and which involved grievances of a practical and distressing nature. The hon. gentleman who had spoken last but one had laid great weight upon the grievances of which the Dissenters had to complain. If the hon. gentleman knew any thing of the laws or constitution of the country, he must know that those grievances were rather of an imaginary character. Was the career of honour closed against the Dissenter? Could he no longer share the laurels of Waterloo or Trafalgar? Could he not reach the highest offices in the service of his country? There was no situation in the army or the navy of the country which did not lie open to him. He had yet to learn what obstacles existed against the honourable ambition of the Dissenters. They were qualified to fill the first military offices; and they had their full share of the civil power of the country. He stated facts which did not admit of contradiction. Were there any of the hon. member's (Mr. Fergusson's) industrious and intelligent countrymen who entertained the least apprehension that any law interfered with them in the prosecution of their efforts to obtain independence and station? He had now had the honour of sitting in that House for two and thirty years, and during that long period, he was now called upon for the first time to approach this question. It had been already truly stated, that nearly forty years had elapsed since the question had been agitated in parliament. It would be allowed on all hands,
<col>730</col>
that that was a sufficient proof that this was not a matter of great public and pressing grievance. But reasons had been assigned for this silence of the Dissenters for a period of nearly forty years? It was said that, on account of the foreign wars in which the country had been engaged, and of the progress of dangerous principles at home, the Dissenters conceived it better pot to agitate the public mind with the discussion of their question. Did the noble lord know the history of the last forty years? Was he not aware that a question analogous to this in principle&#x2014;that a measure affecting the civil and religious disabilities of a large portion of his majesty's subjects&#x2014;a measure of momentous importance to the empire at large had, during that period, been over and over again discussed&#x2014;that it had engaged more than any other the attention of this House&#x2014;that it had excited differences and. dissensions between the greatest men and the first statesmen of the day, and had led to changes of the utmost consequence in the government of the country? This was the history of the country, during the period to which allusion had been made. On the other hand, was it to be credited that the respectable petitioners now before the House, many of whom possessed acute intellects and elevated minds, enjoyed the highest consideration in the country, and were deservedly respected&#x2014;was it to be credited that if such men conceived there was any thing in the state of the law to impede the fair, useful, and honourable, exercise of their talents, they would not have long since respectfully, but firmly and unanimously, called upon that House to remove the grievance? If an oppressive grievance existed, if a wrong of some kind or other were committed, would they have failed to remonstrate against the continuance of the system? The fact could not be so; for, during the long period of forty years, the parties most interested had preserved a total silence. He well recollected the debate upon this question in 1791. He was not then a member of that House. Since that period the question had not been discussed, and the happiest results had been the consequence. All those distressing feuds which formerly existed, had ceased: an end was put to those differences which had sprung up in society, and had interfered with the relations of public and private life. Men came toge-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0373"/>
<col>731</col>
ther in society, without any reference to those religious dogmas, upon which they happened to differ honestly and conscientiously. The members of the Church of England formed a cordial union with their Dissenting brethren. In that work of conciliation none had been so conspicuous as the ministers of the established church, and none were more ready now to foster that spirit which they had been the first to promote.&#x2014;It was plain that this happy state of things must be interrupted by the agitation of the present motion; seeing that it would, at all events, tend to renew discussions which had better be avoided. It would draw attention to periods of our history which it would be well to cast in the shade, and it would revive sectarian animosities, which the charitable and the good were anxious to see buried in oblivion. The forbearance which had been hitherto manifested on these matters had been productive of the best effects; and not the least amongst them was the spirit of good-will and mutual kindness, which had grown up between the established church and the different Protestant communities of this country. It was therefore with no small regret that he found this motion brought forward under such circumstances, and without any urgent or practical grievance to warrant its introduction. There was no gentleman in that House who had observed his career in public life, or who had done him the honour to attend to what he had said, who did not know that he was no friend to the principle of religious tests, in reference to civil rights. He was no friend to such a principle. If a man's conduct and intentions were moral and pure, religion ought not to be employed as a test to exclude him from any situation, civil or military, in the service of his country. He should be glad to see all such tests abolished. But when he found them in existence, he would say that on coming to the consideration of this momentous subject they were bound to look at the system as a whole, one portion of which could not be properly dealt with, unless reference were made to all the rest. Now, he must say that, in that view of the question, he considered those tests not a very pressing evil but an evil of a very secondary nature indeed. He would look at the whole spirit of the system at once; and he would appeal to its results. Notwithstanding that some
<col>732</col>
classes of the community were suffering under great and crying grievances&#x2014;notwithstanding that, so far, great detriment accrued to the best interests of the state&#x2014;looking at the system altogether, it was impossible to separate it from the results which had followed in its train&#x2014;it was impossible, in regarding the system, not to perceive the connexion between it and the strength and security of the empire at large. The strength, and security, and prosperity, of the empire mainly depended on the present system; although a portion of that system, in the sister country, bore a taint which destroyed every thing good and useful, and stimulated every thing bad, into increased activity and danger to the state and the condition of civil society. Impressed with these feelings, and under this view of the subject, he should be opposed to a change in the system.&#x2014;In regard to the question immediately before the House, he could refer to the sentiments of one of the greatest statesmen that ever lived&#x2014;a minister, whose views and counsels upon this, as upon all other subjects, he had endeavoured to support, and by whose judgment he had been guided he meant Mr. Pitt. His sentiments upon the present question would be found in the Correspondence which had been recently published, and which took place so far back as the year 1801, between that right hon. gentleman and his late majesty. It would be there seen how anxious Mr. Pitt was to modify the laws which affected the Dissenters; and it would be also seen, that, notwithstanding his great anxiety upon that head, he was opposed to any modification whatever of them until the Catholic question had been settled. Then, and not till then, did Mr. Pitt conceive that a proper opportunity would arise to take those laws into consideration, with a view to their revision and modification. In that very interesting correspondence the opinions of Mr. Pitt upon this and many other important subjects were fully detailed; and he begged to return his sincere thanks to the individuals who had given it to the world. The correspondence to which he had alluded, bore ample testimony to the sincerity of that great man on the subject of Catholic emancipation. Now that it had been published, he trusted that they should never again hear, either in that House, or in any other place, that Mr. Pitt's feeling, with respect to this question,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0374"/>
<col>733</col>
was merely an evanescent scintilla which had passed across his mind&#x2014;a something that had not assumed any fixed shape, that had not been followed up by any definite plan, in conformity with the principles which he professed. It was because he felt anxious for the success of those principles, and because he thought that the present discussion would not advance them, but that, on the contrary, it was calculated, to create dissension and discord in the country, that he honestly and fearlessly expressed his regret that it had taken place. He looked to the probable consequences which would follow this discussion. He spoke of the consequences of the proposed measure, and of the present discussion, with reference to peculiar principles. He must say, that the principle which the question then before the House involved, appeared to him to be this&#x2014;that whereas, up to the present hour, as the law stood&#x2014;he would not say in its practice, but certainly in its principle&#x2014;the rule of this country was to render conformity to the established church the condition of holding civil offices; but now an attempt was made to remove those laws, leaving others in existence, which bore upon a different part of the population. If, then, they repealed those laws which were the object of the noble lord's motion, and left other laws which were considered by many of an oppressive nature untouched, what became of that general rule? He contended, that from the moment such a course was adopted, the rule was entirely changed, and they created an exception. And who formed that exception? The Roman Catholics alone. The exception, it was quite clear, would, under such circumstances, be levelled and directed against the Catholic faith alone. They would, by acting as the noble lord desired, make that an exception which was now only part of a general rule. Having stated this, he would ask of those who, like himself, were anxious for the success of the Catholic question, whether the making of that change from the position in which the Roman Catholics were placed in the eyes of England and of the world, would not be the means of giving countenance and support to the doctrine, that the Roman Catholics were not, and ought not, to be allowed the same privileges as other nonconformists, unless they were prepared to do away with the spiritual authority of the see of Rome, and thus to remove all idea
<col>734</col>
of a divided allegiance? He was not prepared, he confessed, to take a step that; was likely to make an unfavourable impression with respect to that great question&#x2014;the Catholic question&#x2014;to which he' had always been a friend. He was not abstractedly unfriendly to the propositions of the noble lord; but he could not assent to it, because he was sure that with reference to the Catholic claims, it would make a bad impression. Upon that point he would appeal to the noble lord opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00533"><member>Lord Nugent</member><membercontribution>, across the table, dissented from this proposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00534"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> continued,&#x2014;Would the noble lord take upon himself to say, that the feeling in favour of the Roman Catholics was general, was universal, through all the Dissenters of this country? He was convinced that the present step, so far from being a step in favour of the Catholic claims, would be the means of arraying an additional power against them. He knew something of the feelings of the Dissenters, as well as the noble lord? (Nugent) who presented the petition of the Roman Catholic nobility and gentry in their favour; and he could tell that noble lord, that it would, he owned, be revolting to his feelings, to continue the disqualification of the first duke of the realm, and at the same time to display an ostentatious liberality, by attempting the repeal, with respect to the Dissenters, of certain forms to which every exciseman was subjected; and to do away with which, he believed the whole collective body would not subscribe one day's pay. He would tell the noble lord who had introduced the subject, that he was satisfied, if the question; were carried and finally settled, that the noble lord would find in the great body of Dissenters (not indeed amongst the liberal and enlightened part of that body) a strong feeling of opposition to the Catholic claims. He would tell the noble lord, that this question might be argued by different persons in very different ways. Would he deny that there were in this country a great many persons, perhaps a majority, who most sincerely, and conscientiously, and honourably, entertained the greatest apprehensions lest the Roman Catholics should be allowed a further participation in the privileges of the constitution, unless under certain engagements? He was ready to contend, that there was not one of those persons who was not convinced that, whenever concession was made, it ought to be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0375"/>
<col>735</col>
accompanied with some strong tests&#x2014;with some efficient securities. If this were so, he would ask the noble lord, if he did not think that this class of sincere Protestants, who, if the oaths against supremacy and transubstantiation were removed, were anxious that some other securities should be given&#x2014;would not feel it desirable to ask, with reference to the Roman Catholics, that on their part some guard, some security, should be given, if fresh rights were extended to them? Not only might the Protestant Dissenters, but the church of England men exclaim, in the event of a concession of the Catholic claims,&#x2014;" We will have this check&#x2014;we will have an annual bill of Indemnity." He did not mean to say that they could have this for ever, but he would assert, that if such a proposition were moved previously to the introduction of the Catholic question, it would raise new obstacles to the accomplishment of that measure. He begged gentlemen to recollect, that the Test act was introduced to guard against the Roman Catholics; and it was not impossible that very many persons in this country&#x2014;indeed, he believed such to be the fact&#x2014;were still desirous to retain this check on their conduct.&#x2014;with a view to the success of the great question to which he had so often adverted, he must say, that he was not prepared to part with this security; and he felt this the more strongly, when he recollected that, only four years ago, they had passed an act to admit Roman Catholics into all the offices of the revenue, from the highest to the lowest, in this country; and that at that period they retained the principle to which he had adverted. It was in this view of the subject, that he for one was not prepared to support the noble lord's motion. He thanked the noble lord for the moderate, yet able, manner, in which he had brought forward his case. He was quite sure, if the discussion led to dissension out of doors, or to any exasperation, of those feelings which were generally mixed up with questions of this kind, that such an effect could not be traced to the way in which the subject had been introduced. Such dissensions and such feelings could only arise from the nature of the case itself, and could not be attributed to the tone or temper in which the noble lord had approached the subject. Nothing, he was bound to say, could be more mild, more prudent, or more discreet, than the way in which the noble lord had brought
<col>736</col>
the question before the House. Such were his feelings on the subject, and being strongly impressed with the truth and justice of the important principles contained in Mr. Pitt's correspondence, he deemed it to be his duty to take the position which, he had done on this occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00535"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> said, that if he understood the true principle of a free constitution, it was, that the general rule existed, that no one was to be excluded from any of his civil rights on account of his religious principles. He therefore thought, that if this principle was to be recognised in the present case, the <i>onus probandi</i> was on the adversaries of the present measures, and not only on those who were desirous of placing a restraint on men on account of their religious sentiments, but also on those who were for supporting those restraints which already existed. The hon. baronet (sir R. Inglis) had said, that he was unwilling to admit that every person had an equal right to power; but though the (lord Althorp) perhaps was not prepared to say that every person had an-equal right to power, he was at least quite sure that every one had a right to a-n equal capability for power. He therefore thought, that, unless the hon. baronet was prepared to shew that such admission to power was likely to be dangerous to the State, it would be the duty of the House&#x2014;the duty of the legislature&#x2014;to put all classes of persons on an equal footing. The hon. baronet had said, that the existence of those laws was necessary for the protection of the established church. Now, he was as desirous as any man for the protection of that church; neither could he agree with the hon. baronet when he, stated, that the lowest support in favour of the established church would be sufficient&#x2014;that the lowest amount of disqualification was all that was necessary in that respect. With that position he could not agree, for he thought that no disqualification at all was necessary. That the established church ought to be supported he was quite ready to admit; indeed, no one could reverence that establishment more than he did; and, therefore, that its funds should be appropriated to one particular sect he should be the last to deny; but beyond this, he did not see that it was necessary to the support of the established church, that all other sects should be disqualified from a participation in, an equality of rights and privileges. The hon. baronet
<image src="S2V0018P0I0376"/>
<col>737</col>
had said, that he should be the last man to interfere with the right of all men to exercise their religious worship in whatever way seemed to them most proper; and had appeared to take merit to himself, that he admitted the principle of toleration to be proper. Now, he had certainly never expected in the present day&#x2014;in the nineteenth century&#x2014;when men's opinions were expanding and developing&#x2014;he had never expected to hear any hon. member pluming himself upon his liberality in admitting the principle of toleration. But, if the acknowledgment of this principle was so great a thing, what would the refusal of it be? It would be the most unjustifiable tyranny&#x0021;&#x2014;it would be imprisonment&#x0021;&#x2014;it would be confiscation&#x0021;&#x2014;it would be murder&#x0021; That was what the refusal of it would be; and he was therefore certain, that any thing like the excuse, that such and such things were to be tolerated, would never be admitted; and, indeed, he had thought that he should never have heard such a position advanced. The right hon. gentleman who had just sat down, in the course of his speech had stated, that the evils of the present act, which it was the object of this motion to oppose, were of a very trifling nature. The right hon. gentleman was for admitting that the principle of the act was merely conventional&#x2014;that the reasons for supporting the bill were simply theoretical; as it was, in fact virtually repealed every year; but he would by no means admit that it embodied any practical grievance. Now, he contended, that what was kept to hang over the heads of so large a body was, in fact, a practical grievance; and he contended too, that it was a practical grievance to the Church of England. Was there any one in that House who would pretend to say, that the profanation of religion was not a practical evil? Was there any one in that House who would say, that the holding out an inducement to men to take oaths in which they did not believe, was not a practical evil? The Church of England proclaimed, that she was not at hostility with her neighbours, while the law assured them that every one who took office was guilty of a violation of its edicts. Those who were accustomed to look lightly at such matters might think that these things were no evil, but he was not one of those who could regard such matters with levity; and it therefore gave him much pain to see such points sanc-
<col>738</col>
tioned by the law, and laid open to the grossest abuses. Without trespassing further on the time of the House, it was for these reasons that he intended to support the motion of the noble lord, and he trusted that it would meet with the approbation of the House, as he was sure that it would be one of the steps to those important changes which it was time to make in behalf of those who were suffering for conscience sake.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00536"><member>Lord Nugent</member><membercontribution> said, that, from the temper in which the House had come to the discussion, he hoped that the recommendations in the opening speech of his noble friend on that score would be superfluous. The example of his noble and honourable friends, the mover and seconder, more powerful than even their recommendations, would, he was sure, be sufficient to deter gentlemen from the expression of any heated feelings on a question, on which, if some gentlemen were of opinion that the interest of the established church were indirectly menaced, some millions of persons in this country, of all the most useful, and of some of the most distinguished classes, felt their common law privileges to be cruelly and unjustly assailed.<lb/>
A great deal of matter had been brought forward, particularly by the right hon. colonial secretary, which, whatever effect the right hon. gentleman might think it might have in justifying his own vote, did not, in strictness, bear on the question before the House. Nor should he (lord N.) have offered any observations, had he not been personally invited so to do, by the right hon. gentleman. He would not, however, be led into mixing up in the discussion of the claims of the Protestant Dissenters any opinions of his own on the grievances suffered by the Roman Catholics. He was perfectly ready to avow, for his part, that it was on one great principle of universal, undistinguishing right to religious liberty, and on that alone, that he gave his support to the Catholic question, and to that now under consideration. Still, he felt that the questions were not only entirely independent of each other, but were as distinctly separable in principle as any two questions could be that never can by possibility be opposed to each other [hear]. He could not comprehend, even after the speech of the right hon. gentleman, and, after all the attention with which he had listened to it, how it was possible for any honourable member who was in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0377"/>
<col>739</col>
the habit of voting for the Catholic question, to vote against this. Still any gentleman might, with the clearest consistency, vote for the motion of his noble friend, and oppose, if he felt he could do so with justice, any further relaxation of the Popery laws.<lb/>
When he said that he could not conceive how it was possible for any supporter of the Catholic question to vote against this, he well remembered the avowal last year of one of the most illustrious and powerful of that phalanx of great men who, from time to time, have lent their aid to advance the Roman Catholic claims&#x2014;one whose death has set a solemn and sacred seal on the opinions which his great talents and matchless eloquence supported in life.&#x2014;But sadly had that authority been misapplied this night.&#x2014;Mr. Canning's objections, he well remembered, were stated distinctly as with reference to the state of the question, and to the state of the government last year. He had heard it with sorrow&#x2014;but how did it now justify the right hon. gentleman, who almost in the same words states the same conclusion, on premises how widely different&#x0021; The right hon. gentleman said he would oppose the motion, because it stood in the way of the Catholic question; and he had done him (lord Nugent) the honour to appeal to him on that point. That appeal he would answer in one word. A substantive proposition was put to him which admitted at once of a plain answer. He looked at this question on its own grounds. He saw that the Protestant Dissenters were unjustly and wantonly aggrieved. He had, then, no choice left. He had no right to take into consideration what it might or might not stand in the way of. He must do justice [hear]. A man had lived a few years in this world to very little purpose, if he had not discovered this truth; that, when the road to justice and right lies plain and open, to choose a circuitous and bye path, was a course generally as remote from political wisdom as it was from political honesty. He need not now say that to the great question of Catholic emancipation he bore as eager and undeviating fidelity as any man breathing. If, in giving his vote, as he intended to do this evening, that vote should, in any respect, injure the cause of the Roman Catholics, he was sorry for it. But his consolation even then would be, that, if he had voted against their interests, he had
<col>740</col>
voted at least in conformity with their prayer [hear]. The Roman Catholics, whose names the right hon. gentleman had put forward to justify his vote were directly opposed to him upon it; and, if they were not, he (lord Nugent) should look with shame and sorrow upon those great names which he had seen with pride affixed to the petition he had the honour the other night to present from the British Roman Catholics for the repeal of the laws against the Protestant Dissenters [hear].<lb/>
But the right hon. gentleman considered the Test and Corporation act to be mere theoretical grievances. Insult is no theoretical grievance.&#x2014;The Protestant Dissenters felt themselves practically aggrieved by those laws. He did not know whether the exclusion of the Roman Catholics from eligibility to parliament and office could be considered a practical, substantial, injury to the great majority of that body&#x2014;except in this&#x2014;that it constantly reminded them, and gave others the power of reminding them, that they were of a class and caste pronounced inferior to others of their countrymen, because ineligible to what others were eligible to. So with the Protestant Dissenters. A man must know little of our common nature who was not aware that, in a free country, such disabilities did amount to a severe practical grievance. It is a very different thing to enjoy privilege as a freehold, or to hold it as a tenement, built as it were on the waste and unclaimed land of the constitution, but only suffered to endure from year to year upon the humble and vexatious tenure of an annual indemnity. Was it a fanciful grievance to the Dissenter when he found himself annually, he would say continually, exposed to a weight of disabilities which he could only remove by submitting to a form of plea which obtained for him, under a pardon, what all others enjoyed under a right, purchasing immunity at the expense of submitting to an insult, and exemption from actual persecution upon the presumed intention of committing an act of profanation. Was it no real suffering that, in failure of this, he should be subject to statutes which prevented Un from inheriting or bequeathing property, which would not allow him to be guardian even to his own children, degrading the father in the eyes of his children, the master in the eyes of his servants, and the citizen in those of his fellows?<lb/>
And how was the grievous and intoler-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0378"/>
<col>741</col>
able nature of such persecution practically mitigated to the Dissenter? By an annual bill of Indemnity, of which no longer ago than the year 1789, no less a man than lord North had said, "That any Dissenter who availed himself of the pretext of the Indemnity bill was guilty of mental fraud,&#x2014;of an evasion and abuse of the act of parliament which solemnly requires the tests to be fairly and fully given." Now, if these tests were "fully and fairly given," what was the situation in which these persons would be placed, in which every member in the House might, by possibility, and by the vigilance of an informer, be placed? His noble friend who had opened the debate had clearly shewn they were exposed to the base interests, and still baser passions, of informers, who might be urged by their own views, or by those of others, to betray them. Were they to place the Dissenters under such disabilities because they differed from the Church of England on doctrinal points? If not, they were placed in a still greater difficulty.&#x2014;It was not in that House, or in office, that their political doctrines could be dangerous.&#x2014;If they were dangerous to the established church, the danger would break forth in very different ways, and in very different places&#x2014;where the flame could not be extinguished because it could not be reached. If the church be part of the state, preserve the church by reconciling all hearts in the service of the state. Do not yearly remind them of the only differences existing between them and you&#x2014;the religious differences&#x2014;approach them with feelings of fellowship and brotherhood, instead of annually reminding them of a fanciful and inoperative, and obsolete, proscription.<lb/>
There was one part of the right hon. gentleman's speech, which he had heard with the greatest astonishment,&#x2014;namely, that one of the motives which induced him to refuse his assent to this motion, not to the Dissenters, not to his (lord Nugent's) noble friend, but to the country at large, was, that for eight and thirty years the Dissenters of England had suffered these injuries patiently. Because the Dissenters had not complained,&#x2014;because they had borne with these unjust laws,&#x2014;because they had endured them in silence,&#x2014;therefore redress was to be withheld&#x0021; [hear]. This was a dangerous lesson for a government to teach a people. That, because they had been loyal and long-suffering,&#x2014;because, though ill-treated, they had shewn
<col>742</col>
an undeviating attachment, and given a steady support to the government during a long and dangerous and eventful period,&#x2014;that therefore their prayers should be rejected, their grievances under-rated, and the cause of them unremoved [hear]. Was it right to say this to three millions of people in this country, was it wise of a minister of the Crown so to say it that it might be heard by seven millions of people in Ireland. Such an expression, when it went over to Ireland, would be strangely construed. It would chill the hearts of the loyal, and justify the violence of the disaffected. How would such a sentiment be hailed by the Catholic Association? He should most cordially support the present measure; first, he would support it, because he considered those laws as leading to the profanation of a most sacred right; secondly, he would support it, because he conceived those laws were calculated to set up a religious party against the state; and thirdly, he would support it, because he thought that those laws enlisted the proudest if not the best feeling of the human heart in support of non-conformity. They afforded a reason for nonconformity. These laws would deter any gentleman of high feeling from conformity, lest possibly it might be attributed to him that he was induced from an improper motive to come forward. These few words had rather been extorted from him by the right hon. gentleman, than called forth by any wish of his to mix himself up with a measure which had already been so triumphantly debated by hon. members near him. If he had obtruded himself on the House, he had done so, under the excitement of strong feeling, and under the influence of his own decided conviction that the concession now required ought to be granted without delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00537"><member>Lord Milton</member><membercontribution> said, it was not long since a disclosure had been made of the course his majesty's ministers meant to take on this occasion. Since that disclosure had been made, he confessed he entertained a very great, and he hoped not an impertinent, curiosity, to hear the arguments on which those gentlemen meant to rest their opposition to this motion. At the commencement of the right hon. Secretary's speech&#x2014;a speech which the right hon. gentleman would give him leave to say, was not at all like those clear statements which he was accustomed to give, with reference to commercial matters, for his con-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0379"/>
<col>743</col>
elusion was wholly at variance with his arguments&#x2014;at the commencement of that speech, he undoubtedly felt not a little surprised. The right hon gentleman uttered many lamentations, because his noble friend had, under existing circumstances, as the right hon. gentleman expressed it, thought proper to moot this question in the House. But, for his part, he could not see any good ground for the right hon. gentleman's lamentations. They all knew what a convenient phrase "existing circumstances" was to any politician, to any gentleman in that House, who wished for an opportunity to defeat a particular measure. The right hon. gentleman spoke much about "existing circumstances," and he was naturally anxious to learn what those circumstances were, which rendered the introduction of the present measure so improper; but at last he found, towards the conclusion of the right hon. gentleman's speech, that the reason for not granting this boon to the Protestant Dissenters was, not that "existing circumstances" were opposed to it, but that it would stand in the way of the Roman Catholics. He begged to congratulate the Catholics of the sister kingdom, and the whole of its great population, on the manner in which the right hon. gentleman had that night shown the sincerity with which he advocated the Catholic cause. He did not know, however, whether the right hon. gentleman's arguments were also the arguments of government; or whether they were to wait for information on that point from another right hon. gentleman, with whom the right hon. gentleman has recently united himself? Which of these gentlemen was to propound to the House the feelings of government on this subject? What he had heard that night might be merely the sentiments of the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies; but ha should be exceedingly happy to hear from the right hon. gentleman behind him (Mr. Peel) that his opposition to this measure rested on the same ground as that of the Colonial Secretary; namely, an apprehension that its success would interfere with the Roman Catholic claims [hear]. The argument of the right hon. gentleman was a most extraordinary one. He said, he could not vote for the Protestant Dissenters, because their case formed a part of a whole, and that whole be confessed to be civil and religious liberty. Now, if that right hon. gentleman's opinions were cor-
<col>744</col>
rect&#x2014;if he were right in his determination then he ought to vote also against the Catholics for precisely the same reason. The same reason which he had told the House prevented him from giving his vote in favour of the Dissenters, must be equally strong against his voting for the Catholics. But he must be allowed to say, that he differed entirely from the right hon. gentleman. One exclusion always became an apology for another. The exclusion of the Catholics thus became an apology for the exclusion of the Dissenters with one set of persons and the exclusion of the Dissenters an equally good apology with others for the exclusion of the Catholics. He did agree with those who had characterized those statutes as a disgrace to the age in which they lived, and he heartily wished they were got rid of. The origin of these acts had already been stated to the House in the course of the debate. The Corporation act was passed in that heighday of loyalty which followed the Restoration; but even then it was not passed without strong debates, and would not perhaps have been allowed to pass at all, if that powerful minister, lord Clarendon, had not come down to the House with what, in modem times, would have been called a "green bag," filled with rumours of insurrections, and alarms of plots which the Presbyterians were meditating. These plots were, in all probability, merely sham plots; but if, under sham plots, the Catholics were, sixteen years afterwards, excluded, so also by sham-plots were the Dissenters excluded by means of the Corporation act. The House had been told, that these acts were no practical grievance. He did not exactly understand what meaning some persons attached to the term "practical grievance." The Protestant Dissenters were a most respectable body, but, generally speaking, they did not move in the higher orders of society: he meant, that in the very highest ranks of society Dissenters were by no means frequent. It was very well for persons standing upon so high a ground to look down into the vale in which the Dissenters lived, and say, at a glance, that no practical grievance existed there. Let them look a little closer. Was it no practical grievance that in a town one might be an alderman, and another, who was. quite as good a man, might not? It ought to be recollected, that to be an alderman was quite as great
<image src="S2V0018P0I0380"/>
<col>745</col>
an honour to a grocer or a linen-draper as to be a member of parliament was to other men. It was quite true that these were objects of ambition. It might be very unphilosophical to care about them: it might be very unphilosophical in Mr. Tomkins, or Mr. Thompson, to wish to be an alderman [a laugh]; but they might have that wish&#x2014;and why might it not be gratified? He would go a little lower. Was it not a practical grievance to a lower order of persons to be excluded from filling those situations in the departments of Customs and Excise for which they might be very well calculated? As matters now stood, they had men at every quarter sessions coming to qualify for such offices, by a profanation of the most shocking description. It was not, however, the Dissenters only who were affected by the present state of the law; many persons of the Church of England refused to qualify for office by taking the sacrament. The operations of these acts were not felt equally in all counties. In some counties there were Dissenters, nay, even Catholics, acting as magistrates under the protection of the Indemnity act. In other counties, however, this was not allowed; and thus there was no uniform rule for the whole country, but the practice of different counties varied according to the caprice of a lord lieutenant, or a bench of justices. In one county the orders of a magistrate (formerly a member of the House) had been disputed, because he had neglected to qualify by taking the Sacrament, and though the orders were good in law, they were nevertheless abandoned. In his opinion, these were practical grievances. In the county which he had the honour of representing, they were felt to be so, in consequence of Dissenters refusing to act as magistrates. For many of them were more scrupulous than others, and did not choose to act under the Indemnity act, which was passed every year; and this, therefore, was a practical grievance, not only upon the Dissenters, but upon the country at large. He did trust that these acts would ere long be erased from the Statute-book; he believed they would, notwithstanding the formidable array of household troops which had been referred to by an hon. member, and he certainly did see a great number of faces which they were not often in the habit of seeing, and which induced him to think there had been the application of what they used to call
<col>746</col>
"the whip;"&#x2014;and notwithstanding the doubts of the right hon. gentleman opposite&#x2014;[Mr. Huskisson said, he had not expressed any doubt]&#x2014;he begged pardon. At all events, he understood the right hon. gentleman to make this inference&#x2014;to infer, from the silence of the Dissenters, that they did not think they were labouring under any practical grievance from the continuance of these acts. Now, he did think it a little hard, that because in times of great distress, the Dissenters had not pressed their grievances on the House&#x2014;he did think it a little hard to turn round upon the Dissenters now, and say, "You have not pressed your complaints upon us for eight and thirty years, and therefore we do not think it worth while to interfere and excite irritation in the country. The right hon. gentleman had argued in this way, but he must take the liberty of telling that right hon. gentleman, that his speech was the only one which tended to excite any irritation. From the commencement of the debate until that right hon. gentleman spoke, there had not been one syllable uttered which had a tendency to excite any thing like irritation. It was the right hon. gentleman who introduced the irritation, for they must be well aware, that the moment they began to talk about irritation, it was sure to be excited in persons who would not have thought of it if they had not been put in mind of it. The right hon. gentleman had talked about the excellent manner in which the church of England had behaved. He concurred in this eulogium, and thanked the Church of England for its silence on this occasion: but he hoped the right hon. gentleman would recollect, that when he had given them this meed of praise for their silence now, they ought to deserve the same upon all similar occasions. He hoped that they would see that such a line of conduct was more consistent with the sacred duties they had sworn to fulfil, than the course which they had too frequently been induced to adopt. He hoped that they would not forget the lesson of abstinence which the right hon. gentleman had read them on this occasion. From the silence of the Church of England, he thought that this inference might very fairly be drawn; namely, that no dangers could result to the Church of England from the repeal of these acts. He was quite sure, from the evidence he had had on former occasions; that they would not have been backward

in stating their fears, if they really saw ground for entertaining any. He would merely add, that far from being inclined to excite, it was his anxious wish to allay, irritation, and he thought that would be effected if the present motion were successful. He hoped to see that state of things arrive when no man could know what the religion of his neighbour was, by seeing the disabilities under which he laboured, and when a man's conduct through life should be the only test by which another could ascertain what religion he professed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00538"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> rose and said;&#x2014;I am anxious, Sir, not to defer to a later period of the evening, the delivery of the very few observations which I think it incumbent upon me to make in reference to the motion which the noble lord has so ably introduced to the attention of the House. In the course of the very able and temperate address, the noble lord appealed to me personally, not as an individual member of this House&#x2014;not as a minister of the Crown&#x2014;but as the representative of the University of Oxford; and he made that appeal, as I understood, for the express purpose of eliciting from me the opinions which that learned body entertained upon this question, and the instructions which they have thought it right to convey to their representative for the guidance of his conduct in this debate. Sir, I beg to state, in reply to this appeal of the noble lord, that I have not been instructed on this occasion by that University, to deliver any opinion, nor have they intrusted me with any petition to present to the House in opposition to the claims of the Dissenters. I beg to state further, that I am not in possession of any instructions as to the course of conduct which they desire their representative to adopt; and I am, therefore, disposed to infer from this silence, that they have not thought it fit to do any thing with reference to this question, and that they are disposed to rely with confidence upon the judgment of this House. I cannot, however, permit myself to infer from this silence that the members of that University acquiesce in the prayer of the Protestant Dissenters, or that it is their wish that I should support it. All that I gather from it is, that I am left entirely unfettered in the application of my judgment, as to the vote which I may think proper to give upon the question. I approach the consideration of the noble lord's proposition unfet-
<col>748</col>
tered, therefore, by any obligations dependent upon my situation in this House, and prepared to decide upon that which may appear to me the real merits of the se. I trust, however, that I may be permitted to claim the merit of never having on any occasion taken any course with regard to the Dissenters, which might indicate any prejudice or bigotry in the judgment which I might form upon their claims for relief. I am sure the hon. member for Norwich (Mr. William Smith) will admit that he has not found in me, at any time, a prejudiced or bigotted opponent at those seasons when he has before brought the question of their situation before the House. And on one occasion, when the Dissenters Marriage-bill was under consideration, he must admit that I endeavoured to afford him all the assistance in my power towards the accomplishment of his object. I trust, therefore, that I may be at liberty to discuss this question, and to consider its merits in the various views which I may feel it incumbent on me to take of it, without subjecting myself to the imputation of indulging in hostility or bigotry to any class of my fellow-subjects.<lb/>
I entreat the noble lord, however, to consider, in the very outset, the difficulties under which I and other ministers of the Crown are placed when they approach the discussion of these subjects. The noble lord has no responsibility beyond that which arises from the ordinary duty which he owes to his conscience; but a minister of the Crown must be influenced by other considerations, totally independent of the ordinary claims upon a member of the legislature. He has to bear in mind the effect which these measures may have upon the interests of all the various classes of his fellow-subjects. He is to be swayed by many considerations totally independent of his situation as a member of this House; and he must, therefore, be viewed as approaching the question not as a representative for any particular place, but as a responsible adviser of the Crown. In the first place, then, I beseech the noble lord to observe, that this question, like the Catholic question, though it may have in its favour the authority of some great men who have swayed the House by their eloquence and talent, has had equally strong authorities against it. By the admission of the noble lord himself, lord Stanhope, about eighty-five years ago had
<image src="S2V0018P0I0382"/>
<col>749</col>
endeavoured to procure the repeal of these acts, and had failed. Sir Robert Walpole, after him, was favourable to the same question upon principle; but he never could succeed in carrying it. Lord Chatham, who was prime minister of this country, certainly took no prejudiced or unfavourable view of the claims of the Dissenters; and yet, during his administration, nothing material was done in their favour. Lord North, however, took a much higher ground than any minister who has succeeded him, and opposed all concessions, on the point of principle. Then came the discussions in the time of Mr. Pitt, when, in the years 1789 and 1790, the repeal was opposed, both on the ground of abstract right and of expediency. With respect to the opinions of later administrations, I beg the House to recollect, that Mr. Canning, too, expressed his determination to oppose the claims of the Dissenters. I do not say that he was opposed to them on the ground of abstract right, but he certainly did declare, in his place in this House, during the last session, his intention, and I believe the intention of his administration [cries of "no, no"]. Well, then, I do not mean to add to his authority any of the opinions of those who acted with him; but, at least, it must be admitted that he declared his intention to oppose the Dissenters. To these high names must be added that of Mr. Burke; for although he may be said to have been at the time favourable to their claims, and that his subsequent opposition was founded upon a temporary view of our situation, yet it must be admitted, that he opposed them. When the question was discussed in the year 1790, Mr. Burke declared, that, if it had been brought forward ten years before, he should have felt himself bound to support the claims of the Dissenters; but he then saw so much danger to be apprehended to the establishment of the Church of England and the constitution of the country, that he could not consent to repeal the acts of which they complained.<lb/>
I say, therefore, again, that there is not such high authority to be found in favour of the repeal of these acts, as we find advanced in favour of the Catholics; and that a minister of the Crown, charged with the responsibility of protecting all the interests of the country, may be permitted to consider the propriety of their repeal with something like
<col>750</col>
diffidence, when he considers the weight of high names who felt doubts upon the propriety of granting what is now require ed. That the subject is full of difficulty I am ready to admit; and I trust it will not be supposed that, for the sake of supporting my doubts, I could be guilty of concealing the impression I entertain of the real difficulties by which it is surrounded. A great deal has been said about the Sacramental Test, and I cannot but say, although there was some attempt to sneer at what he said, that my right hon. friend, the Secretary for the Colonies, took a very just view of that part of the subject. At the time when the Sacramental Test was first enjoined, it certainly was not considered either a desecration or a profanation. In fact, it was then usual, even for those who professed themselves Dissenters to take the Sacrament at least three times within the year; and there was then no objection among Dissenters to communicating with the Church of England, or to take the Sacrament, and I believe it is even stated by Baxter, the great ornament of this body of Christians, that such was the practice amongst the Dissenters. I am ready to admit that this Sacramental Test, which became a proof of qualification for office, and is still a proof of qualification, was not originally intended for that purpose. The whole of the arguments upon that question are, however, exhausted, in the controversy between dean Sherlock and bishop Hoadly, as well as in the various debates which have taken place in this House, and in which Pitt, Fox, and Burke argued upon all the circumstances of abstract right, or temporal expediency, and exhausted the subject. I do not, therefore, think it necessary for me to touch upon them now; but if I admit that the state of the law has undergone some alteration from the lapse of time, in requiring the Sacramental Test to be taken as a qualification for all offices, the Indemnity act saves those who take it from the profanation which is supposed to be attendant upon the consenting to such an act [cries of "No, no"]. I do not say that it does so in principle; but I contend that it must have that effect in practice. The House ought to recollect, that the Dissenters are in a very different situation now, from the time when it was usual to have a church in London appropriated to the express purpose of qualifying for minor offices; and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0383"/>
<col>751</col>
when those who were to take their turn before the clergyman waited in a neighbouring tavern, until they were called upon to take the Test. All this is now saved by the operation of the Indemnity act, and I cannot therefore see the grievance to be so great as has been contended.<lb/>
I am not prepared, I confess, to argue that this question is essentially interwoven with the protection of the Church of England. I do not think that the two are so connected, that the Church of England must fall if the Test and Corporation acts are repealed: but in considering whether such ancient laws as these ought to be repealed, to argue thus&#x2014;" should we enact them now?"&#x2014;is not, in my opinion, by any means a fair mode of viewing the question. Whether we should or should not enact such laws in modern times, is not the test by which to judge of the propriety of repealing laws in an ancient monarchy like this, where manners and customs may often have grown up and become interwoven with the laws. I must say that the principles on which I am disposed to look at these laws&#x2014;with the exception of their bearing upon the Catholic question, which I of course exclude&#x2014;are precisely the same with those that have been laid down by my right hon. friend. With this exception I take the same view of them as my right hon. friend has taken. I think that my right hon. friend's principle is a right one: is there that great practical grievance, that insult resulting to the Dissenters from these acts, which calls upon the House to repeal them? Is there any thing so absurd in these tests as to make the repeal of them necessary? Or are they of such a nature that, if repealed, the Dissenters will be in a better situation? Nothing, in the whole course of this debate, has surprised me more than the enlarged, and I think, aggravated account of the practical grievance which these acts impose upon the Dissenters. I can only say, that so great is my respect for that large and respectable body denominated Protestant Dissenters, that if I could be satisfied that they really labour under such grievances as have been described, I should be very strongly induced to vote for the repeal of the acts complained of. But I do not think that the great body of Dissenters look at them, together with the Indemnity act, as so great an evil as hon. gentlemen have described.<lb/>
<col>752</col>
We have been told, Sir, to look at the number of petitions that have been presented to the House. Now, if I were sure that these petitions had been quite spontaneous, and not set in motion by any external influence, I candidly declare that I should be disposed to pay much more attention to them. I am only speaking of them as a proof&#x2014;for so they have been called&#x2014;that the Dissenters look upon these acts as an insult and a grievance; and I must say that I cannot think they were altogether spontaneous; but that they are attributable to something else besides this feeling which has been attributed to the Dissenters. If they really felt it a grievance, nothing certainly could be more unfair than to urge their forbearance against them, as an argument why that grievance ought not to be removed. I do not think that my right hon. friend has argued in any such way; but that he merely inferred, from the silence of the Dissenters, that they did not feel the grievance to be so heavy as it has been represented to be, and as it has been said that they did feel it. I confess that I am inclined to draw the same inference. At all events, however, if the number of these petitions which have lately been presented is insisted upon as a strong argument, ought not the silence of the Dissenters to be taken in account the other way?&#x2014;[An hon. member said "No."]&#x2014;The hon. member says "No;" but I beg leave to differ from him. It had been said, "Look at the thousand petitions presented last year, and the six hundred this year"&#x2014;and I am therefore tempted to ask, how many were presented at former periods? In consequence of what has been said upon this part of the subject, I have had the curiosity to search for the numbers which were presented in former years. I have taken the last ten years, and I will read to the House the number which were presented in each of those years. In 1824, there were four petitions presented; in 1825, one; in 1820, one; in 1817, not one; in 1818, not one; in 1819, not one; in 1821, not one; in 1822, not one; in 1823, not one; in 1826, not one. The whole number, therefore, in these ten years amounted only to six.<lb/>
But what has been our own impression upon the subject? And here I must call upon the noble lord himself as an authority. In the discussions which have taken place on the Roman Catholic claims, have
<image src="S2V0018P0I0384"/>
<col>753</col>
the hon. gentlemen opposite insisted upon this topic, and urged upon the House the grievance and the insult of which they now complain? Have they ever proposed to remedy it? In the year 1813, Mr. Grattan passed a bill to remove the disabilities of the Roman Catholics, and the professed end of that bill also was, the removal of every civil disability, of whatever kind, on the score of religion. But what was the effect of that bill? It professed to do what I have stated; but, what did it do? Why, the bill actually subjected Catholics in this country to the operation of this very act, which is now said to be an insult and a grievance. The last bill, which was introduced in 1825, by the hon. baronet, the member for "Westminster, professed to remove those disabilities altogether; but that bill also left the Roman Catholic subject to the operation of this act in England. I must beg leave to call the attention of the House to the preamble of that bill, which ran as follows:&#x2014;" And whereas, after due consideration of the situation, disposition, and conduct of his Majesty's Roman Catholic subjects, it appears just and fitting to communicate to them the enjoyment of the benefits and advantages of the constitution and government happily established in this united kingdom, so that all his Majesty's faithful and dutiful subjects may grow into one nation, whereby there may be an utter oblivion and extinguishment of all former dissensions and discords between them, thus consolidating the union between Great Britain and Ireland, and uniting and knitting together the hearts of all his Majesty's subjects in one and the same interest, for the support of his Majesty's person, family, Crown, and government, and for the defence of their common rights and liberties, it is provided," &amp;c. Now, when it is considered, that a bill which was to have all these admirable effects never proposed to relieve the Roman Catholics from the operation of the law, of which the Protestant Dissenters are now complaining, I think I "am entitled to assume, that the grievances suffered from that law are rather of an imaginary than a practical and real nature. And of the fact that there was nothing in the provisions of that bill to repeal the law in question, there could exist no doubt. Upon a question raised by a noble lord as to that point, Mr. Canning, the warm supporter of the bill, had said,
<col>754</col>
"Sir; this bill does not tend, as is imagined by the petitioners, to equalize all religions in the state, but to equalize all the dissenting sects of religion. I am and this bill is, for a predominant Established Church; and I would not, even in appearance, meddle with the laws which secure that predominance to the Church of England. I would not sanction any measure which, even by inference, could be shown to be hostile to that establishment. But I am for the removal of practical grievance. And in this view of the subject, what is the fact with respect to Protestant Dissenters? It is this&#x2014;that they labour under no practical grievance on account of their religious differences from us&#x2014;that they sit with us in this House, and share our councils&#x2014;that they are admissible to the offices of the state, and have, in fact, in very numerous instances, been admitted to them; but they hold these privileges subject to an annual renewal, by the annual act of Indemnity; so with the Roman Catholics, if this bill should pass. They will be admitted only to the same privileges, and they will hold them liable to the same condition." This, then, as I take it, is sufficient evidence that the Roman Catholic Relief bill of 1825 had never contemplated the relieving the Catholics from the operation of the Test and Corporation acts, as mitigated by the annual indemnity acts. I shall now offer a few words upon the actual nature and extent' of the operation of those acts. An hon. member opposite (Mr. Fergusson) has described, in very powerful and affecting terms, the distressing effect of these acts upon a country towards which no man can feel more cordially than I do&#x2014;Scotland. I applaud the patriotic warmth (if I may be allowed so to express myself) with which the hon. member delivered himself; but, at the same time I cannot help thinking that there were points in his statement which were not a little tinged with exaggeration. For instance, in describing the condition of his countrymen under the Test and Corporation laws, with respect to the disposition of civil office, the hon. member said of Scotland, "that she was exposed to horrid penalties, and that her state at the present moment, was that of the absolute proscription of a whole nation&#x0021; Now, I really think, that this declaration does go a little beyond the strict fact; and I appeal to my hon.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0385"/>
<col>755</col>
friend beside me, whether that is the real state of Scotland at the present moment? Whether it is not rather an inflamed and exaggerated description? Indeed, the hon. member's anxiety for Scotland in particular is not new. On former occasions great endeavours were made by particular individuals of that country, to obtain an especial consideration for her. Even after the debates of 1789 and 1790, it will be found that Scotland did not entirely despair of making out a peculiar case, and getting a peculiar adjudication; and sir Gilbert Elliott, aferwards lord Minto, had brought forward a petition from the General Assembly upon the subject. On that occasion, however, so slight did the real grievance of the question appear, that two noble persons, not likely to be in opposition without especial cause, upon such an occasion, lord Minto the then Lord Advocate, and lord Melville, voted against the motion. But, Sir, I go farther. The hon. member speaks of "horrid penalties," and "proscription." What are the feelings of Scotchmen generally now upon the subject? Where are the petitions from that country? From the whole of Scotland? There has not teen, I believe, a single petition for the repeal of these acts; and even if there had, I should have been prepared with a ready answer to them. Upon the military offices and honours it is not necessary to say any thing. The hon. gentleman says, "You have accepted the services of Scotchmen. You have shed the blood of the 42nd in the peninsula, and thinned the Scotch Greys at Waterloo. It is reasonable that we should have some reward for our services." Now, no one is more ready to admit the value of those services, than I am. But of the higher offices of government, the hon. member complains. "From these," he says, "the Test act shuts us out." Now, I must take leave to say, that of the present cabinet, composed of fourteen members, three&#x2014;lord Melville, lord Aberdeen, and the President of the Board of Trade&#x2014;are good Presbyterians, whom these acts nevertheless have not succeeded in shutting out. I desire not to be understood to say one word against a country which, by its native talent and unwearied industry, has raised itself to an honourable eminence among surrounding nations, and towards which, I repeat, no one can feel more warmly than, myself; but I do think, that the wrongs done to
<col>756</col>
Scotland by the Test and Corporation acts, that hon. member, in the ardour of his national partialities, has considerably overrated.<lb/>
In the same way a noble lord on the other side has intimated that the parties interested in this question were not generally in the highest rank of life; and that from the mediocrity of their station, their rights are likely to be overlooked or to be forgotten. Perhaps the noble lord has properly described the Dissenters as belonging chiefly to the middle class; but, nevertheless, many persons of that persuasion move in a very exalted situation; and I fully agree with the noble lord, that the corporate privileges and honours to which those not immediately in that class aspire are fit and laudable objects of ambition for persons of their condition; such as it is a grievance to be excluded from, and which it is the duty of the legislature to uphold and sanction, rather than to make light of or offend. But, Sir, what is the fact as to the corporate honours? Are the Dissenters practically excluded from corporations? I believe that they are not. What is the practice in the city of London, for instance? I believe that Dissenters are admitted into the corporation of London [cries of "No&#x0021;"]. I may be mistaken upon that point; but my impression is, that practically I am right [repeated dissent.] Then I am possibly wrong. In corporations, the test of the Sacrament certainly by law is necessary: in the case of admission to government offices, I believe the oath of submission is all that is required. But still I believe that the power which individuals have of putting the test to parties applying for admission to corporations, has not been constantly exercised. For example&#x2014;an hon. member (Mr. Sheriff Spottiswoode) has just suggested the fact to me, that the very highest officer in the corporation of London&#x2014;the lord mayor&#x2014;was last year a Protestant Dissenter.<lb/>
But the next question is this&#x2014;can it be made at all apparent, what will be the effect of an alteration in the law? Under the existing system, there has, perhaps, been less of religious difference in England, for the last forty years, than in the same extent of time at any period of our history. Now, that fact, which an hon. member has treated as a reason for repealing the laws complained of, seems to me to be quite as capable of being made an argument
<image src="S2V0018P0I0386"/>
<col>757</col>
the other way. An hon. alderman informed us, the other night, that thirty-nine years ago, in the city of London, a few persons only had the resolution to stand up for a repeal of these acts; while at present there were not more than six or seven who venture to support them. Is not this a proof of the good understanding which has grown up between the Dissenters and the members of the Church of England? An understanding which I should be sorry, by any alteration of the system, to disturb. And it is not at all clear to me, that the Dissenters would gain what they expect by the repeal of these acts. If they excite suspicion and dislike, will they not, as far as the alteration goes, do mischief? The fact is, that the existing law merely gives a nominal predominance to the Protestant established church. A predominance of some sort will be admitted, on all hands, to be necessary, and the present is as slight a one as can well be imagined. Therefore, Sir, I confess I am sorry that I am called upon to vote upon the question, and heartily wish it had been allowed to remain quiescent; practically offensive as I am convinced it is to no one. All the intercourse between the Dissenters and the members of the established church, has been marked, of late years, by the most perfect cordiality; and I regret that any chance should be hazarded, by which it is possible that that temperate and candid feeling should be weakened. What the issue of the debate of this night may be, I cannot say; but of this I am certain, that I have entered into it with every disposition to assist and protect the real rights and privileges of the dissenting body. If the motion of the noble lord opposite shall be defeated, any sentiment of triumph which I may experience from the success of my own policy or opinions will be greatly abated by the fact, that such a result must be attended with disappointment to a class of persons for whom I have the highest respect&#x2014;I may add, the warmest feelings of personal kindness.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00540"><member>Sir T. D. Acland</member><membercontribution>, who said:<lb/>
Sir; I fear I shall scarcely be pardoned for pressing my claim on your attention in preference to that of my hon. and learned friend (Mr. Brougham), who has endeavoured to catch your eye; but, in truth, I am quite aware that, at a later period of the night, and when the hon. and learned gentleman shall have made
<col>758</col>
his observations on the speech we have just heard, I shall have very slight pretension to your notice; and I also wish to state my opinions shortly at this moment, because the candid and conciliatory tone of my right hon. friend opposite, seems to me to afford a favourable opportunity for the introduction of a suggestion which may facilitate an approximation, already, I think, sufficiently perceptible between the opposite views taken of this question. It is surely a fair inference, from the whole tenor of the debate, but especially from the speech of the right hon. gentleman, whom we have naturally regarded as the most formidable opponent of the proposed repeal of the Test and Corporation acts, that there is in reality far less <i>practical</i> difference than was supposed between those who support, and those who object, to the motion of my noble friend.<lb/>
The House cannot have failed to observe, that, on both sides, the main stress has been held on arguments of the negative kind, more than on any contradictory, and irreconcileable, assertion of conflicting principles. My right hon. friend continually urges, that the Dissenters have no practical grievance to complain of, from the operation of these laws. On the other side it is alleged, that no practical benefit is secured to the church from their continuance. Now, supposing both these assertions true, which, to a certain extent, may be the case, the question would be, to which side should the indulgence of the legislature be granted? I have no hesitation in saying, that it should in fairness be exercised in relief of the supposed grievance; for, though the grievance may not be greatly or practically such, it may still be worth removing, if it be keenly felt by a large and respectable body, while, if the benefit be not real, it cannot be worth the keeping, especially when it loads the church with the burthen of unnecessary jealousy and discontent. The only just ground for restriction is, that it is necessary to the maintenance of the essential institutions of the state; but when such a restriction is, or is considered to be, a grievance, and while the benefit it confers is wholly imaginary, it is untenable on any ground of justice or policy. An imaginary benefit, in such cases, is none; but such is the constitution of Our nature, that, whether substantial or not, a grievance, once thoroughly considered as such, will retain as strong a hold on the minds of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0387"/>
<col>759</col>
men, excite as violent heart-burnings, implant as settled feelings of discontent, as though a real injury had been sustained. The highly-wrought speech of the hon. and learned gentleman near me (Mr. Fergusson), in his energetic description of the wrongs of Scotland, confessedly the weakest part of the case, has afforded ample proof to night of the truth of my position.<lb/>
My right hon. friend, however, raises an argument against the Dissenters on this point&#x2014;they cannot, he "says, really feel the grievance complained of as they assert, for they have allowed the question to remain at rest for thirty-seven years; and for ten years previous to the last, not a single petition have they presented.<lb/>
Sir, in my view, the question is, not what they felt ten years ago, but what they feel now&#x2014;what they are likely to feel for ten years to come; and this is the view which should be taken by a prudent government, and a wise legislature. Sir, I think that the seven hundred petitions already presented this session&#x2014;the thousand petitions that covered the table during the last, afford ample disproof of any imputation of existing indifference on their part. Besides, I need not tell my right hon. friend, that it is the part of reasonable and calculating men, to press the suit they have at heart at such times as they may have the fairest hopes of bringing it to a successful issue. If they thought the temper of the House and the country unfavourable to the prosecution of their claims in former years, they did wisely for their own purposes to abstain from petitioning. If, in the present time of public feeling they discern more propitious symptoms, they do as wisely to come forward. What behoves us well to weigh is this&#x2014;that they do petition now; that they do marshal themselves in eager and earnest anxiety for the event; and if the right hon. gentleman should succeed in rejecting their prayer at the present moment, what does he think will be their feelings and their conduct for the next ten years? He may depend upon it he will not lack abundant proof of these feelings. He will have plenty of petitions for the future. I know nothing of the plans or purposes of the Dissenters; I am no party to their proceedings; but I know still less of the workings of human nature amongst any class of men, if the right hon. gentleman's argument, that the indifference of the Dissenters is to be implied from their former silence, will, after the
<col>760</col>
use he has made of it this night, ever be left him again. Sir, I counsel him strongly to meet the forthcoming claims of this body by kind anticipation, while he may do so with dignity and conciliation; and I must again say, that I already hail, as the dawn of better days, as holding out a prospect of some final, and not very distant, adjustment of the question, the candid and temperate speech which he has just concluded. I see, in that speech, no hostility or bitterness towards that body or their claims. I heard no direct and substantive argument against it; and if really the whole of his objection, and that of all who have preceded him on the same side amounts to no more than this, that they wonder why the Dissenters should feel so much at a mere theoretical distinction, I do think so negative an objection must fall to the ground.<lb/>
But, Sir, whatever may be the nature of the right hon. Secretary's objection to the Repeal, the objection to the laws themselves rests on far more substantial grounds, and is not confined to the Dissenters alone. If I should object to them as a Dissenter, I object to them still more as a Churchman. I cannot consent patiently to sanction by their means, the habitual profanation of the altar, the desecration of the most solemn and sacred rite of the Christian religion.<lb/>
Even in the case of those who are in the habit of receiving the Sacrament in the regular discharge of their religious duties, the superinduction of a secular purpose, and interference on any particular occasion, does appear to me to be, so far, a contamination of the purity of the holy ordinance.<lb/>
This was certainly my own case in early life, when I first qualified on taking the office of a magistrate in my own county&#x2014;and I must say, that subsequent reflection has much increased my repugnance to mix up with that religious duty any civil matters with which it can have no possible connection.<lb/>
But if these are my feelings, Sir, with no religious scruples as to the ordinance itself, what should and must be the feelings of those, not Dissenters merely, but even members of our own church, who, having less excuse for availing themselves of the act of Indemnity, are induced, as I doubt not many are, notwithstanding the researches of my hon. friend, the member for Ripon, to approach the Lord's Table
<image src="S2V0018P0I0388"/>
<col>761</col>
for the first time in their lives, by the requisition of the civil magistrate; and prostrating themselves at the altar of their Saviour, profess to humble themselves with the lowliness of a Christian, as creatures in the immediate presence of their Creator, solely as a step to the possession of some temporal advantage?<lb/>
Surely, Sir, it is time that some remedy should be found to prevent the recurrence of such a profanation as this&#x2014;and, if for no other reason, I would decidedly support my noble friend's motion to night, in the hope that it will lead to some change in those laws, which I believe to be absolutely indispensable to the feelings of Churchmen as well as Dissenters. I do not say that I am prepared to go the whole length with him, of supporting an unqualified repeal; nor do I mean to pledge myself now as to the precise extent to which I may be willing to go in the committee, with respect to the entire removal of the law. Indeed, I much wish not to be misunderstood as to the nature of the support I give to this present motion, and which is quite consistent with the principles on which, since I first came into this House, I have always supported the removal of the disabilities of the Roman Catholics. I have always thought those disabilities unnecessary, and therefore unjust; prejudicial to the state, and therefore expedient to be removed; but I have never been an advocate in theory, of what I understand by "the cause of civil and religious liberty." Practically, I am willing to carry that liberty to any extent consistent with the safety of the state, and its essential and fundamental institutions: to concede to Catholic or Dissenter the freest admission to the civil rights and privileges of their fellow citizens, limited only by necessity or danger clearly made out. I would concede this liberally, and without jealousy, as I would desire it myself in a similar case.&#x2014;I see no such necessity now; I anticipate no such danger, either in near or distant prospect, and therefore my opinion has never varied on the Catholic question, though entertained irrespectively of abstract right.<lb/>
The right hon. Secretary for the Colonies, who has placed his opposition to this motion from apprehension of its unfavourable influence on that great question, must excuse me for saying that I take a very different view of its effects, and that I am confident its success to night would great-
<col>762</col>
ly strengthen the ground on which the Catholic claims really stand.<lb/>
Another reason, Sir, why I think these laws may be safely repealed is, that, in point of fact, and by the admission of my right hon. friend (Mr. Peel) himself, no real change will occur practically, as to the admission of Dissenters to civil office. He tells us, that at this moment three good Presbyterians are members of the cabinet, and that the lord Mayor of London last year was a Protestant Dissenter. I apprehend that he means to infer, there is therefore no cause of complaint to the Dissenter under the present state of the law.&#x2014;My inference is, that no danger can arise to the church from the nominal removal of obstructions, which appear thus to have been done away entirely in practice, and that in the highest offices of both kinds to which the laws apply. I should be curious to know whether they were enforced in the case of the three members of the Cabinet, or whether they hold their seats-at this moment by virtue of the Indemnity. It is clear, at all events, that the laws are useless, absolutely nugatory, for any political purposes of the State.<lb/>
An hon. member tells me, that the lord Mayor of last year did qualify for his office by taking the Sacrament, and that others, similarly situated, have done the same. If, Sir, this be so, if any scruples have been forced in their case, then I say that these laws do operate as a religious tyranny and oppression, the freedom and just rights of conscience have been violated, and we owe these gentlemen the only atonement we can offer them, that of relieving for the future, all who think and feel with them from the risk of similar degradation, by the earliest possible abolition, or effectual change, of a system liable to be carried into such unjust operation.<lb/>
A suggestion has occurred to me, Sir, in which, should this motion be rejected, that relief might be immediately secured, by which all the practical evil of the system might be removed, and in which both parties might for some time safely and fairly concur. Indeed I think my noble friend ought himself to coincide in any middle course which offers present relief, and with it a fair prospect of the certain ultimate: arrangement of the whole subject.<lb/>
My right hon. friend, too, would surely not object to any method of safe and effectual relief, which should still leave the theoretic principle of the law untouched
<image src="S2V0018P0I0389"/>
<col>763</col>
for the present. I really cannot anticipate opposition from him to this suggestion. We equally consider the Church of England, I can assure him, an essential part of the constitution of our country. We equally feel it a duty to resist any encroachment which would be attended with danger to the establishment; and I hope we also equally agree in the propriety of affording the Dissenters all the freedom from vexation and restraint which is consistent with the safety of the Church. What I would take the liberty of suggesting to him is this, that on the next passing of the Annual Indemnity bill, he should also introduce a bill for the Suspension of the Test and Corporation acts, <i>pro futuro</i> say for one year or more, and renew it periodically, until the time shall arrive for a more permanent and satisfactory settlement of the question. The principle of the laws would not be abandoned, and the power to call them again into operation in case of danger or necessity, would exist as fully as it now does, though I have yet heard of no one who seriously contemplates the possibility of such an occurrence. I am however not disposed to part with one security even in the abstract, without obtaining another&#x2014;but by suspending these bills we should part with no security&#x2014;we should rid ourselves of the present anomaly&#x2014;we would simply substitute a plain, intelligible, and prospective mode of relief for the retrospective, clumsy, and in some instances, precarious, protection we now afford by the Annual Indemnity.<lb/>
I am willing to admit that it may not be easy to discover at once the exact mode by which the two-fold object we have in view of relief to the Dissenter, and continued securities to the church establishment, may be attained, and secured on a permanent footing. But at all events time would be gained, and the friendly hand of conciliation extended to the petitioners&#x2014;these are great steps&#x2014;every vexatious interference and suspicious surmise would be at an end. Mr. Burke was of opinion, that the substitution of an oath for the Sacramental Test might be enacted, and actually produced a form which he had prepared, and considered adequate to meet the views of both parties. It is not for me to enter now into this part of the question; but, with good-will, I doubt not, some such scheme might be effected. If we are not yet ripe for so complete a change, we may have recourse
<col>764</col>
to the temporary measure of suspension, which would place the Dissenter at any given moment, in precisely the same situation as the actual repeal, and therefore remove, <i>pro tempore</i>, all possible ground of offence to him. By the Church, as the law is, in any beneficial view of protection, virtually a dead letter, no loss could be sustained&#x2014;the principle of protection would remain on record&#x2014;the power of renewing the restriction would not be done away.<lb/>
But my own hope is, that we may possibly still arrive at a final and amicable adjustment, and with that view, and thanking the House for having listened to these suggestions, I shall certainly give my vote to night for going into a committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00541"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;<lb/>
Sir;&#x2014;I assure my hon. friend, that I never gave way, upon any occasion, with greater pleasure than I did to him in the first instance, when I did not know what were the arguments which he intended to advance: but that pleasure has been greatly increased as the speech of my hon. friend proceeded&#x2014;a speech which has relieved me from the necessity of referring to many points, to which I should otherwise have felt it my duty to advert. At the same time, I cannot remain entirely silent, after the course which has been pursued by the two right hon. Secretaries of State, who have opposed the motion of my noble friend.<lb/>
One of those right hon. gentlemen, indeed, opposed the motion so slightly, as to leave little or no necessity for offering a reply to what fell from him. The first objection that presents itself to my mind applies to a point of constitutional doctrine laid down by the right hon. Secretary of State for the Home Department. That right hon. gentleman has stated what I am not prepared to admit: namely, that there is a distinction between a minister of the Crown, sitting in this House, and an ordinary member of parliament. "I," said the right hon. gentleman, "am a member of parliament, and a responsible minister of the Crown; whereas, you gentlemen opposite are called to act on your simple individual capacity; and therefore it is not at all proper for me to do in my double capacity, what it is quite proper for you to do in your single one." Now, Sir, some months ago I sat upon that side of the House which the right hon. gentleman now
<image src="S2V0018P0I0390"/>
<col>765</col>
occupies; but I do not therefore contend, that either myself, or my hon. friends, are entitled to alter our opinions and our course of conduct, with our altered position in the House. This doctrine is to me, Sir, quite unintelligible; but if it were intelligible&#x2014;if it were constitutional&#x2014;it would enable me to join those political reformers, to whom I have, at times, been opposed, and of whom my late friend, major Cartwright, may be considered the outward and visible head. Those pure reformers always contended, that the ministers of the Crown ought not to have seats in this House; while I, on the contrary, maintained, against the worthy major, that they did not sit here as ministers of the Crown&#x2014;that they lost the character of servants of the Crown, the moment they entered this House&#x2014;and that they sat in it entirely as representatives of the people. This, Sir, is my argument. I contend, that they are not ministers of the Crown in this House. They sit here as representatives of the people. They may prepare their measures in the cabinet, ready to be submitted to parliament; but they are not known as the servants of the Crown, whenever they enter the walls of this House, but entirely as representatives of the people. If there really be this distinction in their character&#x2014;this double capacity&#x2014;if the duties of a member of parliament be merged in those of a minister of the Crown, then, undoubtedly, the good old constitutional doctrine is become like one of those vulgar errors that have had their day, and are now exploded.<lb/>
Then, Sir, the right hon. gentleman does not merely find it necessary to defend his own cause&#x2014;though a sufficiently able combatant himself, he has thought it proper to call in aid another and more doughty combatant, the worthy baronet on the bench above him&#x2014;whom I heard with as little possible effect as human nature would permit&#x2014;not, certainly, as the hon. baronet seemed to think, with a laugh or a sneer, but assuredly with a very moderate share of conviction. At all events, the arguments contained in the speech of the right hon. Secretary were, at any rate, formed on the views of the question taken by the hon. baronet. He has followed him into the field, saying, "Be thou my shield and my chosen knight, and I will fight in thy train." [Mr. Peel intimated, across the table, that he had not followed the arguments of the hon. baronet.] To me, Sir,
<col>766</col>
it appears, that the view taken of the Sacramental test, by the right hon. gentleman, so worthy of notice, is one which he has been reminded of by, and which he willingly and joyfully adopted from, the champion at his side.<lb/>
We are told, Sir, by the right hon. Secretary, that the principle upon which the Test and Corporation acts were framed, was, to allot to the Dissenters the least possible degree of exclusion, consistent with the safety of the British constitution. Now what, Sir, is the worthy baronet's idea of the minimum of exclusion? Why, Sir, it is a total exclusion from all places of profit, trust, and honour, under the Crown. The hon. baronet, who, I believe, holds a lucrative office under the Crown himself, and who is, no doubt, supported by three fourths of the place-holders and office bearers in the House, looking down front the lofty eminence of trust and emolument on all persons not in the pale of the Church, have discovered, that the slightest punishment, the minimum of penalties they can inflict upon those persons, is, that they ought to be prevented from ever enjoying any emoluments, any places of trust or profit, to which they, as members of the established church, have a sole right.
<quote>"Then," said the hon. baronet, "I do not like to talk so slightingly of&#x2014;I do not like to disparage&#x2014;the wisdom of our ancestors." Far be it from me, Sir, to disparage the praise thus bestowed, by the? hon. baronet, on the "wisdom of our ancestors." The phrase, however, I consider to have been one of the most fruitful sources of mischief to the country: but I must inform the hon. baronet, that that phrase had been disparaged long before the existence of the Test and Corporation acts&#x2014;not by ridicule, but by sound argument&#x2014;not by the sneers of the senseless, but by the soundest wisdom, the greatest knowledge, the highest intellect, that England ever produced. I commend the phrase to the mitigated censure of the hon. baronet. For it was a lord High Chancellor of England&#x2014;a person of the name of Bacon, or some such name&#x2014;a name, perhaps, which has no respect in the eyes of the hon. baronet&#x2014;who first stamped the seal of disparagement on the phrase which the hon. baronet brings forward this evening "to fright the House from its propriety." He it was, Sir, who first reprobated the eternally-recurring praises of the "wisdom of our ancestors." He it was, who laughed
<image src="S2V0018P0I0391"/>
<col>767</col>
at the phrase "experience of past ages;" In truth," said he, "if not a contradiction in terms, it is the grossest abuse of language: for it proceeds upon this basis, that the world was older and wiser when it was younger, or than it now is, when every youth knows more than the grey hairs of former times."</quote>
Sir, the right hon. Secretary thinks it a peculiarly strong argument, that the Sacramental Test only enforced, by act of parliament, upon official persons, that which it is the duty of every person to do without such enforcement: and the hon. baronet contends, that the act of Uniformity requires it. God forbid, Sir, that I should presume to say what is, or what is not, to be found in the Statute-book: but at least I can say, that I have looked into the Index&#x2014;I have looked into the Rubric&#x2014;I have looked into the Canons of the Church of 1603; but I cannot find, except in the latter, that uniformity is enforced: and, as those Canons were never confirmed by act of parliament, I must consider them to be without authority. If the hon. baronet referred to the act of Uniformity of the 13th and 14th of Charles the Second, that act I maintain, only requires uniformity in prayer, and directs how the ministers ought to perform the Sacrament. It further requires, that they should, every Sunday, read prayers, and once in each month perform the two Sacraments. Now, the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper might be performed when two or three were gathered together; but the other could not, although the act wisely enforced it, unless there was somebody on whom it could be bestowed. In looking into the Acts I find, that amongst the illustrious individuals and high officers, who are subjected to the test, are the keepers of chases, game, and warrens. Those high personages are called upon to take the Sacrament once a quarter. Now, Sir, to quiet the tender consciences, and to still the alarms of the hon. baronet and the right hon. Secretary, I beg leave to assure them, that they may sleep soundly in. their beds, for there is no statute existing, which inflicts a punishment upon them&#x2014;no penalty demandable of them&#x2014;provided they should not have taken the Sacrament, according to the Church of England, unless they hold some office. If any person dissents from the established church, he is not allowed to take the Sacrament, unless he takes a place; but he cannot hold a
<col>768</col>
place, unless he takes the Sacrament. Where, then, is the exigency for it, in other cases? And if that exigency does not exist, the hon. baronet's argument leaves the question just where it found it.<lb/>
But, Sir, the hon. baronet says, that he is a friend to improvement in the arts and sciences, and that he wishes to seethe present age wiser than those of former days; although, at the same time, he cannot approve of our improvements iii morals and in politics. He would have us adhere to the wisdom of the ancient sages of Greece and Rome, who knew nothing of a representative government, nothing of juries, nothing of quarter-sessions and an unpaid magistracy, nothing of an established church, the safety and security of which was the corner-stone of the hon. baronet's argument.<lb/>
We have been told, Sir, that the imposing the Sacrament as a test has been long in existence; and we have often been asked, "What does it signify?" This question has been repeated, Sir, this evening; and it has been answered&#x2014;unanswerably answered&#x2014;by my hon. friend below me (Mr. Fergusson), and by the hon. gentleman who spoke so ably in the early part of the evening (Mr. Wilbraham). "What does it signify?" Why, Sir, I say it signifies every thing. First and foremost it signifies a great deal to the Church itself: and here I speak as a Churchman&#x2014;as a member of the Christian church established in England&#x2014;founded on the doctrines of the Scripture, patronized by the State, and confirmed by statute, as well as by common law. I would ask every man&#x2014;particularly every serious man, who has made religion an object of his contemplation, and who values it a rush, whether there could, by possibility, be devised a greater impropriety&#x2014;a more polluting, more degrading, indecency and impiety, than to make the Sacrament a custom of the constitution, and the test of office. It is the most holy rite of our religion&#x2014;of the purest religion upon earth&#x2014;of a religion which, above all others, that all time had seen dawn upon man, was most abhorrent of secular ties, most alien from fleshly purposes&#x2014;of a peculiarly mild character, and which, from its beginning, though Other religions allowed mankind to share with other Gods, had forbad contamination with such Gods, and fleshly lusts, and the worship of Mammon.&#x2014;this religion, the purest of all
<image src="S2V0018P0I0392"/>
<col>769</col>
Religions, and this rite, the most holy rite of that religion, was, by this statute, degraded and polluted, by being made the passport to the place of a common gamekeeper. Is not this enough&#x2014;is not this sufficient&#x2014;to make us all say, that it ought to exist no longer? Does not this fact cast upon those who maintain the necessity of continuing this act in force, the onus of showing&#x2014;not by talking to us about the wisdom of our ancestors, of the law, of the state, of tythes, of the clergy, but by sound argument&#x2014;the necessity, the absolute necessity, for the safety of the church, as part and parcel of the safety of the state, that this precise form should be upheld.<lb/>
And what arguments, Sir, do the opponents of the Protestant Dissenters use, in support of the continuance of these obnoxious tests? The right hon. Secretary says, that no practical grievance has arisen to that body, from the continuance of these restrictions; that what the Churchman can have, that the Dissenter can have also. What, Sir&#x0021; is it no grievance&#x2014;to use the expression of the late Mr. Canning&#x2014;"to have the mark of the chain remaining, although the fetter itself may have been knocked away?" Assuming, Sir, for the sake of argument, that no practical grievance is inflicted by those laws&#x2014;though that there is none I utterly deny&#x2014;is the stigma nothing? Is it nothing that a Dissenter, wherever he goes, is looked on, and treated as an inferior person to a Churchman? Is it nothing that Churchmen should be able to say, "we are in possession of the good things?" Is it nothing to be thus degraded by law, and insulted as a body? Is it nothing, even, that the hon. baronet should say, as he has said this night, "we will allow you to do so and so?" "What is it that gives the hon. baronet the title to use this language, any more than my hon. friend, the member for Norwich, but that the law encourages and entitles him to use it? The only difference between them is, that the hon. baronet conscientiously believes in one faith, and my hon. friend, the member for Norwich in another. The hon. baronet says, that the presence of my hon. friend in this House, is a proof that there is no practical grievance: but this very reference is, I contend, an insult&#x2014;not meant, I am satisfied&#x2014;for the hon. baronet is of a kindly disposition, but the effect of that degradation, which
<col>770</col>
the law allows; Is this not a menace Sir? Can it be advantageous to the church? I am sure it cannot. It increases the animosity of the Dissenters against that church, and does not, in the least, tend to make them better subjects.<lb/>
It has been said, that the late lord mayor of London was a Dissenter; and when I saw the worthy sheriff approach the right hon. gentleman, I felt some alarm, as I have naturally a sort of professional apprehension of the approach of that officer; although I am not aware of any present cause of fear, seeing that I am protected by my privilege. If, however, the worthy sheriff had remained in his seat, and had not served the right hon. gentleman with the argument, that the late lord mayor of London was a Dissenter, it would have been better for the right hon. gentleman's view of the question. That very circumstance makes, Sir, in favour of my argument. For being a Dissenter, he was only able to hold this place by taking the sacrament of the Established Church. He was obliged, therefore, to repress his repugnance to that sacrament, before he could enter upon the office.<lb/>
It has been said, that Richard Baxter, not only took the sacrament himself, but maintained, that Presbyterians might safely take it. I know, Sir, the people of Scotland well: I have spent several years of my life amongst them; and sure I am that not one Presbyterian in a thousand would, on any terms, take the Sacrament of the Church of England. A strict Presbyterian will not go into a place of worship where there is an organ he will, on no account, kneel at an altar. They did not think that the Church of England was so very distinct from the church of Rome, that they could renounce their" own church, and adhere to the former, "If," said they, "you place two eggs on a plate, one of them is not more like the other, than the Church of England is like her elder sister the Church of Rome. This, I confess, was very calumnious. No two services can be more unlike each other. It shews, however, the jealousy of the Presbyterians. But, if the Presbyterians disliked the Romish church, on account of the vestments of the priests, and its altars, and regarded kneeling as idolatrous, is it to be wondered at, that they should evince repugnance at what they consider a; mixture of idolatry, with
<image src="S2V0018P0I0393"/>
<col>771</col>
Christian worship? The late lord mayor of London was obliged to comply with this test, if called upon. It is not always that a public officer is called upon to take the sacrament. It seldom so happens, unless where there is a contested election. In that case, the opposing candidate may compel compliance with the statute. If, then, in a contest, one candidate has the majority of electors on his side&#x2014;has been fairly and honestly chosen&#x2014;and is furthermore a man of the greatest merit&#x2014;the other candidate may nevertheless, say to him, "You have the majority, it is true&#x2014;you have been fairly elected&#x2014;you cannot be defeated by any plea during the election&#x2014;but you have not qualified, and therefore it is impossible for you to be returned."<lb/>
The right hon. Secretary, the member for Liverpool, may recollect, perhaps, a contest which recently took place in that town, and which certainly was one of the most ridiculous I ever heard of. Two gentlemen, both belonging to the same party, actually' expended more than ten thousand pounds each, in contesting the office of mayor. It was one of the hardest fought contests ever known; yet, hard fought as it was, if one of the candidates had had the misfortune to differ from the Established Church, as to the thirty-nine articles, and the other had not, the Dissenter would have lost his election. So also in a case which has recently occurred in the city of London, respecting the appointment of an alderman for the Ward of Vintry, and which remains hung up for the judgment of the court of King's-bench&#x2014;if one of the candidates had happened to have differed from the Church of England about the article of transubstantiation, and had not qualified, there would have been an end to this tedious controversy&#x2014;all the trouble of the law-suit would have been saved, and his opponent elected&#x2014;not because he was the fittest person for the office, or because he had most votes, but merely because one of the parties happened to be a Dissenter.<lb/>
Now, Sir, if this is not a real grievance, I have yet to learn what a grievance is. The House can only come to the knowledge of a few of such cases as these: but how many must there be of which we know nothing&#x0021; But, supposing there was no contest at all, and that the Dissenter walked over the course without opposition '&#x2014;suppose him unanimously elected&#x2014;
<col>772</col>
suppose him the very fittest person to fill that office&#x2014;a single malicious individual may defeat the election, by resorting to the qualifications required by the statute, and out the Dissenter must, as a matter of course, go&#x0021;<lb/>
What, Sir, are the consequences resulting from all this? Why, that the Dissenter, under such circumstances, will not seek office. He will go to his country-house or his library&#x2014;he will withdraw himself from public life, and seek in private that occupation which in public is denied to him&#x2014;he will lose his appetite for that government, that church establishment, and that constitution, which oblige him to seek seclusion, and deprive him of that for which he is most fitted, and to which he is best entitled.<lb/>
Is this, Sir, the way to conciliate three millions of Dissenters, who are not ignorant&#x2014;as the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies imagines them to be&#x2014;of the laws which oppress them? They do not say, "What does it signify; or what are we the worse for these restrictions." They know they are the worse for them; and, on behalf of the constitution, the church, and the state, I am anxious to impress the fact upon the House, that the Dissenters are the worse for these disabilities. I tell the House, and I warn it again and again to consider, that these persons are thereby made the worse subjects.<lb/>
Again, it is said, that after their own laches&#x2014;that after having so long passed over the matter in silence, the Dissenters have no right to come forward to claim the repeal of these laws. But that argument, Sir, will be of no avail. In the year 1787, when the question was discussed in this House, there was a division of 176 against the motion, and 98 for it. Another discussion took place in 1789, when the Dissenters were defeated by so small a majority as 122 against 102. If matters had gone on smoothly and quietly, and if the anticipations of Mr. Pitt in 1790 and 1792 had been realised&#x2014;if peace had continued throughout the world, and this-country had continued to enjoy the blessings of external tranquillity&#x2014;if that other event had not occurred, which had disturbed the prosperity of so many nations, and of France herself, though ultimately tending greatly to her improvement&#x2014;if the French Revolution had not taken place&#x2014;I will venture to say, that long before this time, the Dissenters would have been re-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0394"/>
<col>773</col>
leased from the Test and Corporation acts; for, under the circumstances at that time, the majority of twenty was considered by their opponents, not a victory but a defeat.<lb/>
It has been said that, under the benign influence of these laws, the Dissenters have gone on, and will go on, quietly for ages. But what, Sir, were the riots at Birmingham I am satisfied that, if these tests had not existed, pointing out one set of men to the animosity of another, those riots would never have taken place. There would have been no means of influencing the passions of the people, or of exciting those outrages which were so much to be deplored. After this, exasperated feelings sprung into existence; and, if the Dissenters ceased immediately to prosecute their claims, it was because they waited for a more favourable opportunity of pressing them. After the breaking out of the French Revolution, it would have been insanity to have done so. The Catholics themselves did nothing; and from 1793 to 1805, a period of twelve years, not a word was said by the Dissenters, on account of that Revolution, and the two French wars; and wisely and generously did they act, in abstaining from urging their suit. When, in 1805, Mr. Fox introduced the Catholic question into the House of Commons, and lord Grenville into the House of Lords, I have reason to know that the Dissenters declined to bring forward their own grievances, lest, by so doing, they should thereby do injury to the cause of the Catholics.<lb/>
These, Sir, were the causes of the laches and the silence of the Dissenters, now endeavoured to be brought against them; and I must say, that the right hon. gentleman, in reckoning up the number of the petitions presented by them to this House at former periods, has not treated the subject either with the gravity which becomes it, or with his usual good sense. Their case is now, however, brought forward, and the right hon. gentleman says he cannot consent to yield them any thing. He says, indeed, that if he was convinced that the Dissenters really did feel themselves aggrieved, that they were not moved by external influence&#x2014;that the petitions were the spontaneous acts of the petitioners, he would do&#x2014;what?&#x2014;agree to the motion of my noble friend? No&#x0021;&#x2014;but he would, in that case, turn his consideration as to what were their grievances. This, Sir, I
<col>774</col>
cannot think a very logical mode of proceeding. If external influence be used on one side, is it not also exerted on the other? Is there not the established clergy in every parish? are not many of them hostile to the claims of the Dissenters&#x2014;and if so, why do they not come forward and petition against them? The reason is, that the people will not do so, and are not hostile: and this is another proof, that no harm can accrue to the Established Church from restoring the Dissenters to their rights. Of this I am quite satisfied, that the representatives of every town will hear from the places they represent, the voice of their constituents in approval of the vote which they shall give in support of my noble friend's motion: for every where there has arisen a body of constituents, intelligent, wealthy, and, if I may use the expression, influential, to a degree of which those who have not well considered the subject can form no adequate notion&#x2014;I mean the Dissenters&#x2014;and these, and not only these, but a large portion of the members of the Established Church will feel, that their representatives have best discharged their duty, by listening to the prayer of the oppressed portion of their countrymen. In no town will the members of the established church take offence at such a vote. He will conciliate neither by voting against the motion of my noble friend&#x2014;he may offend both&#x2014;and he must, of necessity, do an act of injustice to one of them.<lb/>
Sir, we have this evening heard much of the authorities of great names against this question; but great names, I am happy to say, can also be adduced in sanction of the claims of the Protestant Dissenters. Fox, Chatham, and Walpole, were favourable to the abolition of these acts; and I may add the name of Pitt; for, in the recently published correspondence between his late majesty and that minister&#x2014;and, for the publication of which correspondence I heartily thank those who have given it to the world, though with a very different object, I admit, from that which it actually promotes&#x2014;in that correspondence, Mr. Pitt distinctly avows his opinion to be in favour of one general measure of relief for all disqualified persons. It may, Sir, seem presumptuous in me to differ from a man so skilled in parliamentary, and cabinet proceedings, but it is not alone my I opinion that the Catholic question ought to be kept distinct from that of the Pro-

<col>775</col>
testant Dissenters. I have consulted many of the wisest men in this House, to whom their interests have been committed '&#x2014;men the most devoted to the great work of doing justice to the Catholics&#x2014;and they, with one voice, approved of the feeling and the judgment of the leaders of the Catholics, that the two questions should be kept distinct, and recommended, with one voice, the separation of the respective claims, "We do not know," said they, "whether or not we shall do injury to the cause of the Dissenters, but of this we are assured, that to mix up the interest of these' two great classes, cannot serve the cause of the Catholics." That was their full persuasion, and it is also mine.<lb/>
But it has been said that the authority of Mr. Burke is on the other side. Sir, I am as willing as any man to treat with respect&#x2014;with the profoundest deference&#x2014;the opinion of that great man: but it must be a matter of perfect notoriety to every person in this House, that, but for the perversion that the intellect of that eminent man underwent, on all points that directly or indirectly could be supposed to have any connection with the French Revolution, or with which any of the principles applicable to that great event could at all be brought into contact, he would have been decidedly in favour of what justice and liberality demand on behalf of the Dissenters. In fact, his authority, might, with equal propriety, be cited on the question of the Slave Trade. An hon. friend of mine, who is no longer a member of this House, and whose absence I sincerely deplore&#x2014;I mean Mr. Wilberforce&#x2014;told me that Mr. Burke avowed to him, that he had once been favourable to the abolition of the Slave Trade, but that he had altered his opinion, and could only consider it to be, "a shred of the accursed web of Jacobinism." I entertain, Sir, a profound respect for the talents of that great man, but, after such an exaggerated expression of his feelings&#x2014;after manifesting that he felt, or imagined he perceived, a connection between the relief of the Dissenters and the events of the French Revolution, it would be vain to hope for any thing like the wisdom or the candour that, at other seasons, and under other circumstances, characterized the opinions of that great man. And, whatever may be the degree of veneration for the man, I cannot admit his authority to be decisive of claims which involve the rights and interests of mil-
<col>776</col>
lions, and least of all is his authority to be acknowledged, where his most inveterate prejudices had been roused into activity, where his feelings and his passions caused him to view every thing through the distorted medium of that overwhelming event. Even Mr. Windham, who agreed with Mr. Burke on so many subjects, dissented from him upon this, and had sanctioned a repeal of these acts. Then, Sir, comes the authority of Mr. Canning.&#x2014;He made&#x2014;and I regret that he did so, for two reasons&#x2014;a declaration against the repeal of those laws. In the first place, I regret it on his own account, because I think that it was a very rash, and a very ill-advised declaration, and calculated to be injurious to his personal character; in the second place, I regret it&#x2014;not on account of the question, because to that, proceeding as the declaration did on a total misinformation with regard to the facts, it can do no harm&#x2014;but on account of the injury it is calculated to inflict on those liberal principles of which Mr. Canning, during the latter part of his life, was the useful assertor and patron, by throwing some discredit on the soundness of his judgment on general subjects of a large and important nature. Much, Sir, as I respect the memory of Mr. Canning, still, as I cannot give any weight to the authority of Mr. Burke; viewing every thing as he did, through the distorted medium of one engrossing subject, so I cannot give any weight to the authority of Mr. Canning, labouring, as he evidently did, under a complete misconception with reference to the whole of this question. The very words used by Mr. Canning&#x2014;" As there is no practical grievance "abundantly prove this. If Mr. Canning had been aware of the real facts; if he had heard the statements which have been this night made; if he had deliberately read the Corporation act; if he had listened to the unanswered, because unanswerable, arguments of lawyers in this House&#x2014;I say unanswerable, and I call on any one to answer the argument of my hon. and learned friend on this side of the House&#x2014;if Mr. Canning had done and seen all this, and had felt, as he must have felt, that the construction of the law is such as it has this night been justly represented to be, I cannot believe that he would still have refused his acquiescence in a remedy for the evils of which we complain. Mr. Canning never knew that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0396"/>
<col>777</col>
persons dissenting from the Church of England might be kept out of corporations; that they were liable to undergo a second election after having been unanimously chosen for an office in the first instance. If Mr. Canning had known all this, his enlightened mind would have revolted at the motion, that the Annual Indemnity act was a cure for the grievance.<lb/>
Sir, that bill is the last point upon which I beg leave to trouble you with a few words. As long as the Dissenters were hostile to the existing government, so long it might be necessary to retain the Corporation and Test acts for the protection of the restored family. But, Sir, we have for eighty-five years past had the best possible proof that all such danger was felt to be at an end. Year after year, such is the confidence of parliament in the Dissenters, the Annual Indemnity-bill is passed without opposition in this House, and without exciting the slightest alarm in the country. Why not, then, pass a Perpetual Indemnity-bill, now that you find an Annual Indemnity-bill is not sufficient for the purpose in view? To adhere to the practice hitherto pursued, is both an insult and an injury. It is an insult, because the inference is, that your confidence in the Dissenters is imperfect&#x2014;it is an injury, because you exclude them from offices of trust and emolument, and expose them to a variety of vexatious proceedings. Sir, the sum and substance of the whole argument seems to be this:&#x2014;We are told that little remains to be done for the Dissenters. Our answer is, why then not do that little? In proportion to the little which they have to ask, is the little which you are called upon to give. Be influenced by the duty which you owe to the Dissenters; but, above all, be influenced by the respect which you owe to the rites and ordinances of your own church, obviously profaned by those very acts which were passed to support them. Nor is that profanation rare. In one not very distant corporation which I could name, above sixty of those outrages take place annually; nay, a particular church is set apart for that subject, in order that the Common Council of the corporation may there qualify. It is a mockery, under such circumstances, to say that a great grievance does not exist. Such an assertion is utterly repugnant to truth and to common sense. Let any one deny the fact; let any one deny the law; let any one con-
<col>778</col>
tend that the evil is ideal; and I will answer him by referring to the seventeen hundred petitions to which I implore the attention of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00542"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, he was anxious to state shortly the grounds upon which his vote would be given, because as that vote would be adverse to the motion of the noble lord, he should be sorry that his motives should be misconstrued, and that he should be supposed to approve of the laws in question, or to think that they afforded any real security to the established church. He was as much a friend, as the noble lord who made this motion to civil and religious liberty; he was an enemy to all interference between man and his conscience; he utterly disbelieved that such interference can ever give security to the church or to the state, it could do no good; it must do evil; it must either turn honest men into hypocrites, or make loyal men discontented. The legitimate objects of civil and political safe-guards, were civil and political institutions; with the secret opinions of the human breast, religious and speculative, the laws of man could not without tyranny interfere, unless such opinions were embodied into acts, and such acts became dangerous to the civil and political institutions of society.<lb/>
The laws in question were founded upon the supposition, that peculiar religious tenets were necessary indications of peculiar political opinions: but, however this might have been true in former times, it was not true in the days in which we live. Let any man look back to the eventful period of the last thirty years, and say whether, amidst all the internal dangers to which England has, during that time, been exposed, amidst all the plots and conspiracies and treasons which have successively threatened the constitution, it was possible to trace the workings of theological opinions, or whether, on the contrary, all these disorders have not arisen from causes purely political, and entirely unconnected with religious differences. If, then, it was expedient to require precautionary tests from those who are to be admitted to situations of trust and offices of power, those tests ought to have reference to the trust and power to be conferred, and should be of a political and not of a religious character. But the laws in question proceeded upon a different principle, and while they ex-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0397"/>
<col>779</col>
cluded the most loyal and well-affected man, provided he had peculiar opinions on points of theological doctrine and church discipline, they freely admitted the most determined enemy to the constitution, if only he had no objection to a particular mode of performing a religious rite.<lb/>
But then it might be said, that these laws were the safe-guards and bulwarks of the established church. Weak and perilous, indeed, would be the condition of that church which should depend for its support upon the aid of such legislative enactments. The strength of a church consisted in the number and character of those who profess its doctrines; but doctrines and opinions could not be propagated by compulsion; on the contrary, the human mind revolted instinctively against the force which was employed to compel it, and clung with additional tenacity to those very opinions from which we endeavoured to wrench it. The history of mankind taught us but one lesson on this subject, and showed that those religions had struck the deepest and firmest root, whose infancy had been most exposed to the storms and tempests of persecution. The Church of England had for its safe-guards the purity of its doctrine, the piety and learning of its ministers, their moral conduct and exemplary lives. It had for its bulwarks the attachment and reverence of the people; while those safe-guards remained, while those bulwarks continued to exist, it might smile upon the attacks of its enemies, if enemies it had; it might do more, it might look with charity upon their differences; but, if ever it should cease to rely upon its purity and piety, it would look in vain to legislative props for its support.<lb/>
But if those laws were unjust towards the Dissenter, and unnecessary for the security of the Church; why, it might be asked, should they not be immediately repealed? He answered, that for the last eighty years they had virtually and practically been repealed; that the annual Indemnity act, notwithstanding the legal refinements and hypothetical cases which had that night been put, had converted them into a dead letter; merciless and severe though they might be, yet for eighty long years, they had been asleep and spell-bound; and, as he saw no possibility of their being awakened, he would
<col>780</col>
not trouble himself to care about an existence, which had ceased to deserve that name. He looked upon the revival of those laws as absolutely impossible; it would be an evil to which the country could not submit, it would be an evil affecting not merely the Dissenters, but the members of the Church of England; for as the test was required, for almost every possible office, or employment under the Crown, from the highest in the state to the most insignificant and menial, it might fairly be assumed that, for one Dissenter who would become obnoxious to the penalties if the acts were to be revived, there would be ten members of the Church of England caught in the trammels of the law.<lb/>
The revival of those laws, then, being an event not to be supposed, the only question was, whether their dormant existence was an evil of sufficient magnitude to call for the interposition of parliament? His opinion was, that parliament should dispose of practical evils before they began to deal with theoretical ones; and he objected to take up the last, until the first had been redressed. There were two classes of men upon whom the laws imposed civil and political disabilities on account of religious opinions; the Protestant Dissenters, and the Roman Catholics. The penalties on the first were virtually repealed, and had no operation, or at least a very trifling one; the penalties on the last were in full, and oppressive force. He did not choose to begin with the lesser evil, and leave untouched the greater; he would begin with the greater, and when that was brought down to the level of the lesser, then he should be prepared to consider the whole subject upon a general view, and to deal with both classes upon a common and uniform principle. That was, in his opinion, the statesman-like mode of proceeding&#x2014;that was the only way by which they could hope to heal differences and tranquillize the empire&#x2014;that was the only course which could be just towards the Catholics. The proceeding recommended must necessarily tend to increase their discontent. Parliament was refusing, session after session, to redress the real grievances of the Catholics, and they were now called upon to relieve the Dissenters from grievances that were theoretical, or at least extremely trivial. This was an undue partiality and preference, he would wish to pursue an opposite course; he would
<image src="S2V0018P0I0398"/>
<col>781</col>
first strike off the fetters from the Catholic, before he took off the nominal restraint from the Dissenter; and when they were both thus brought to an equal enjoyment of the same practical liberty, then he should be ready to consider the expediency of wiping away from both the remembrance of former injustice.</membercontribution></p>

<title>POLICE OF THE METROPOLIS, AND<lb/> THE DISTRICTS ADJOINING THERETO.]</title>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00545"><member>Mr. Speaker</member><membercontribution>; I am desirous of calling the attention of the House to a subject, which at first sight, perhaps, may appear to be limited in its application, and local in its objects; but which, in point of fact, is connected with considerations of the utmost importance to the well-being of the country. I allude, Sir, to the increase of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0400"/>
<col>785</col>
crime which has lately taken place in the metropolis, and the districts immediately adjoining thereto; and to the state of those establishments of police, and to other establishments of a similar nature, which are connected with the prevention of crime, and with the detection of offenders. The greater part of those whom I have now the honour of addressing may recollect that, at an early period of the last session, I gave notice of my intention to propose to the House, to institute an inquiry into the state of the Police in the Metropolis. The circumstances which led to my retirement from office, prevented my then instituting the inquiry which I wished to pursue; and after Easter it was too late to allow the persons concerned in the administration of public affairs, to prosecute any active or efficient inquiry into the subject. A noble lord, the member for Bandon (lord John Russell), gave notice of a motion upon the subject, and at his instance a committee was appointed, which had for its object an inquiry into the causes which had led to the increase of crime in the country generally. That committee prosecuted its inquiries for some time, and made a report upon the subject, which contains a great deal of very useful information, and which has laid the foundation of further inquiries, which I trust it is the intention of the noble lord to re-institute in the course of the present session. The inquiries of the committee to which I allude were directed to three objects. First, the cause of the increase of crime in the Agricultural Districts; secondly, the cause of the increase of crime in the Manufacturing Districts; and, thirdly, the cause of the increase of crime in the Metropolis. The only subject, the only branch of these three divisions, which the committee had, during the last session, leisure to inquire into, was the first of the investigations. No evidence was taken as to the cause of the increase of crime in the manufacturing districts: no evidence was taken as to the cause of the increase of crime in the metropolis.' These last two subjects were not at all gone into by the committee, for the reason I have stated.<lb/>
Now, Sir, I feel, when about to propose a Committee of Inquiry into the state of the Police, and into the state of those establishments which are connected with the suppression of crime, that all inquiry would be necessarily imperfect, unless the House devolves upon that committee the duty of inquiring into the third branch of the sub-
<col>786</col>
ject; namely, the causes of the increase of crime in the metropolis, and the districts adjoining thereto. I therefore feel some satisfaction at having, in the motion which I have now to submit to the House, obtained the entire assent of the noble Lord, who originally proposed that inquiry, and who, probably, will renew the investigation which he has so happily commenced. In moving for a committee to inquire into the causes of the increase in the number of commitments and convictions in London and its vicinity, Sir, I most heartily wish that it was not in my power to adduce satisfactory evidence of the necessity of instituting such an inquiry. Unfortunately, the evidence of such necessity is too plain, too frequent, and too important, to have escaped any man who has given the slightest attention to the subject. Any person who has the least information with respect to the state of many parts of the districts which border on the metropolis, must be perfectly satisfied that the security for property, and even for person&#x2014;but particularly the security for property, is not what it ought to be in every well-regulated society; it is not the protection which every subject who gives allegiance to the state has a right to expect. This inference is founded not only upon the experience of all who reside in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, and who have personal knowledge, and correct information, as to the state of many parts of those districts, but it is also drawn from the returns which are prepared at the office of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and which have already been laid upon the table of this House. These returns, Sir, afford a most convincing proof that there has been, within late years, that increase in the number of committals and convictions for crimes in London and Middlesex, which alone affords sufficient proof, not only of the policy, but of the absolute necessity of some inquiry into the subject. Speaking of the causes of the increase of crime in London and its vicinity, one observation offers itself with respect to the increase of crime in the country generally. I must postpone this branch of the subject, until I have disposed of that which I am now upon. Sir, the returns to which I allude, contain an account for each year of the number of commitments and convictions to the prisons of London and Middlesex&#x2014;an account of crimes committed on the population of that part of the kingdom. From these returns the numbers appear as follow:&#x2014;

So that in these four years, there is no very material variation in the amount of the number of committals, and there was a reduction in the number in the year 1823 of 270, as compared with the year 1820. In the year 1824, there began to be an increase in the number of commitments; and this has gone on progressively until the end of 1827. I mentioned that in 1823 the total number of committals for criminal offences (for I exclude slight cases, such as assaults, offences under the Vagrant act, and all crimes of a petty nature, and speak only of higher crimes), was 2,503. The number of criminal commitments in London and Middlesex was,

So that in 1826 the increase was rapid; and, although the number of committals in 1827 was less by seventy-six than those of the year immediately preceding, still the increase of the former years was so very large, that the small decrease in 1827, as compared with the year 1826, can be no reason why the House should object or hesitate to institute the inquiry I have the honour to propose.<lb/>
It is some satisfaction, in looking at this part of the question to be able to inform the House, that the increase of the number of offences is not an increase of those crimes which are of a more aggravated nature; there is no increase in the number of cases of personal violence, of murder, of assaults upon the person; the increase is solely in the number of those offences connected with property. If we compare the total number of commitments in 1826 with the number in 1820, we shall find the increase to be 684; for in 1820 the numbers were 2773, and in 1826 they were 3457. If we compare the numbers committed in these two years, we shall find that the increase in the cases of simple larceny, are more than sufficient to account for the increase in the total numbers. In 1820, the number of persons committed for simple larceny was 1,384. The committals of the same nature in 1826 were 2,118, being an increase of 734. The total increase of the general number is 684, which shows a decrease in the other species of offences: but,
<col>788</col>
with respect to simple larceny, you will find an increase upon the whole.<lb/>
The considerations connected with this part of the subject appeared to me of such immense importance, that a short time before my retirement from office I took considerable pains for the purpose of procuring information as to the amount of crime in foreign countries compared with the amount of population, in several large districts and towns in those countries. I have obtained some returns from foreign countries, which, however, it will be difficult to bring into comparison with those of our own country, because, in the former, the classification is different from that in the latter. The returns which I have procured refer to Berlin, Vienna, Antwerp, Paris, Brussels, Hamburgh, and several others of the largest cities and towns of Europe. I have also procured similar returns from the principal towns and cities at home such as London, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Dublin, and Edinburgh. I will allow that such documents furnish rather subjects of curiosity than guides from which any positive inference can be drawn with safety; but I have this morning selected some remarkable facts from a work by M. Peyronnet who was at the head of the police in Paris. It is limited to the year 1825, but it is drawn up in so admirable a form, and the subjects so ably treated, that it is well worthy the attention of all those who feel inclined to turn their attention to such matters, either in this House or in our criminal courts. It enters minutely into details of the ages of the criminals, the nature of their crimes, the place and time of their commission, and the period at which the cases were tried and finally disposed of, and distinguishes crimes against the person from crimes against property. It is exceedingly curious to observe the comparative state of crime in different districts. I this morning compared the crimes and population of Paris with the crimes and population of Middlesex. The last census of the population of Paris was taken in 1817; but I believe it is admitted upon authority, that between that period and the year 1820, the population of Paris has not increased in any material degree. In 1817, the exact amount of the population within the barriers is stated to have been 657,152 souls. Adding to this the inhabitants of prisons, forty-three military establishments, and the occupiers of hotels (of which there are six
<image src="S2V0018P0I0402"/>
<col>789</col>
hundred and ninety-two within the barriers), there is an addition of 56,794, I making the number amount to about 714,000 persons. Adding to these the population in the environs of Paris amounting to 107,740 persons, the whole population amounts to 821,706. In Paris they have three classes of criminal tribunals. They have; first, the Courd'Assises, which takes cognizance only of the higher description; secondly, they have the Police Correctionelle, which takes cognizance of a lighter character; and, thirdly, they have the simple Police, which is presided over by the Judges de Paix. The second tribunals can inflict punishment to the extent of five years' improvement; whereas the juges de paix cannot inflict punishment for more than five days, or a fine of more than from one to fifteen francs. It is not easy, therefore, looking at the operation of these three tribunals, to make a comparison between the relative degree of crime in Paris and in London. In 1823, the number of accused brought before the Cour d'Assises amounted to 692; in 1824, the number amounted to 843; and in 1825, to 804. So that, taking this average we find, that the proportion of accused amounts to one in every 1022 inhabitants. This comparison is made with reference to the entire population of the department of the Seine.&#x2014;There are also some extraordinary statements which shew the great difference which exists as to the nature as well as to the extent of crime in different districts. It appears that in large and populous places, out of every hundred offences, ninety are offences against property, and ten against the person; while in thinly-inhabited districts&#x2014;in Corsica, for instance&#x2014;out of each hundred offences, seventy-six are against the person, and twenty-four against property. This is a very curious fact; but it is not easy to draw any decisive conclusions from it. It does not, however, appear, that where large bodies are congregated together, property is most the object of attack; while in thinly-peopled districts, such as agricultural counties, offences arise principally out of malicious feelings, and other motives of a personal nature, and are for the greater part offences against the person. In some part of France the number of accused are as one in a thousand, while in other parts of France they are as one to 27,342. These are the extremes of crime in that country.<lb/>
<col>790</col>
I now turn to the population of London and Middlesex, and I find that in 1821 it amounted to 1,144,531, viz.

The average of criminal commitments for the three years 1823, 1824, and 1825, was 2,700, or one person in 423. Whereas, in the last two years, the average of criminal commitments was 3,400, out of a population of 1,300,000 persons, or one person in 380. From this it would appear, that the comparison I have made is in favour of Paris; but I do not believe that it is so in point of fact, seeing that the returns of crime are made only from the highest criminal tribunals.&#x2014;If hon. members looked to the numbers brought before the Police Correctionelle, they would perceive the difference. In 1825 there were no less than 4,432 persons brought before this tribunal, for such offences as combinations, swindling, defamation, and assaults. It also includes the offence of simple theft; and, of the above number, 1,206 were accused of this last offence. If I add this number to the 800 I have already mentioned, it would make 2,000, which, in a population of 821,000 persons, amounts to one person in 410. So that, in point of fact, there is no material difference in the comparative state of crime in London and Paris in the years 1823, 1824, and 1825. Unfortunately, in the last year, 1827, there was a great increase in the number of offenders, as the following document will show:&#x2014;<lb/>
The number of criminal offenders committed for trial to the different gaols in England and Wales has progressively very much increased within the last eighteen years. In the year 1809 they amounted to 5,146, only. In 1826 they had increased to 16,147; and, during the year 1827, the number has still further increased to 17,921 or 1774 more than the number in the preceding year.<lb/>
In the last year the increase in forty-four counties amounts to 1,931. There is, however, a decrease in six counties (and in Bristol) of 157, which makes the nett increase of 1774 as above. In two counties the numbers in the two last years are the same.<lb/>
The numbers in 1827, as compared with the preceding year, have increased thus&#x2014;<lb/>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0403"/>
<col>791</col>
Convictions 1,469; acquittals 141; no bills found, &amp;c. 164: total increase 1,774. Sentenced to death 326; transportation 462; imprisonment 681: total increase of convictions 1,469.<lb/>
The number of persons convicted of, and charged with, burglary, has increased in the several counties 96 in the last year, excepting in (London and) Middlesex, the number therein is rather less than the preceding year. The number of persons convicted of, and charged with, the following-crimes, has also much increased during the lastyear&#x2014;namely, house-breaking 132; cattle, horse, and sheep, stealing 139; forgery 44; coining 13; robbery of the person 26; larceny from the person 26; embezzlement of property of their employers 10; frauds 53; receiving stolen goods 126; offences under lord Ellenborough's act 35; and offences under the game-laws 102.<lb/>
Sir, I have to beg pardon of the House for entering into these details [hear, hear&#x0021;] I am aware that they are subjects more peculiarly fitted for the attention of the committee; but, upon a question of such importance, I acknowledge I am anxious to furnish the House with all the information I can, in order to enable it to adopt a sounder system than exists at present upon this question. The objects which I propose for the consideration of the committee, are the causes of the increase of crime and the state of the Police of the metropolis and its vicinity. I am sure that the noble lord, who last year introduced one branch of this subject, would, if called upon, find it difficult at once to decide upon the causes of the increase of crime at present. For my own part, I consider that it is to be attributed, in some measure, to the exposed and insecure state in which property is placed in many parts of the metropolis, and to the facilities which are afforded of removing it from one part of the country to another&#x2014;in a word, to the increased means of committing and concealing the commission of an offence, and to the increased ingenuity of those who live by preying upon their neighbours. A person who thinks proper to exercise his ingenuity in this way has better opportunities of seizing on property than its owner has of properly securing it. I must confess that I am not very sanguine with respect to the benefits to be derived by this committee. I much fear that the noble lord who took so active a part on a former
<col>792</col>
occasion, and who, I hope and trust, will again devote his time and attention to the subject, will find that the evils complained of have a much deeper root than a want of employment. It will, I have no doubt, befound that those evils are produced by different causes in different districts. In agricultural counties, one cause of the increase of crime will be found to be the Game-laws. This is a subject which no doubt calls for inquiry; but the more I look into the subject, the more I feel convinced how unsafe it is to rely on any one cause, as the origin of the evils of which we complain. And sure I am, that any man who looked, to the Game-laws as a main course of the increase of crime, would act under a delusion. Let hon. members look to the increase in counties which are not game counties, and they will perceive that the evil must have its origin in other causes. The Game-laws are, I repeat it, one cause; and one which is a fair object of inquiry: but we must also look into the many other causes which I have no doubt will be found to exist. Let me ask for a moment, what effect the Game-laws can have upon the increase of crime in the metropolis? It would be absurd to imagine such a thing.<lb/>
Amongst those other causes which appear to me to bear upon the general increase of crime in a far stronger degree than the state of the Game-laws, is the state and operation of the Poor-laws in some of the counties. In many counties, it is well known, that the rate of wages is so low as to require that the deficiency should be paid out of the Poor-rates. This I consider to be a most injurious practice; it operates to destroy that independence of mind which is the foundation of moral character, and it is still farther objectionable as a most expensive and circuitous mode of payment. It is probable that the committee will find the cause I have just stated to be of much more extensive operation than many of those which it was usual to assign. At the same time I much doubt, Sir, whether this effect of the Poor-laws will be found to have operated in this way in London and Middlesex; on the contrary, I fear that the increase of crime in these districts will be found to have arisen from causes upon which I fear to speculate, and upon which it will, perhaps, be better that I should reserve my opinions until an opportunity presents itself of entering fully into the proposed inquiry. I am decidedly of opinion, how-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0404"/>
<col>793</col>
ever, that we can, by a speedy inquiry, apply some remedy though not a complete one&#x2014;and the sooner we set about that inquiry the better. An amendment of the police system, although it cannot prevent the evils we complain of, may yet go far towards correcting them. But while I express this opinion, I must confess that I despair of being able to place our police upon a general footing of uniformity; I cannot hope to take St. Paul's as a centre, and have a radius of ten miles, in which our police could be able to act in unison. Let the House but consider for a moment, that the metropolis consists of three divisions&#x2014;Southwark, London, and Westminster. Those distinct and discordant jurisdictions tend to produce any effect rather than the decrease of crime. The worst too of it is, that any interference with these jurisdictions, say, for instance, that of London, will hardly fail to be met with jealousy. I observe that the worthy alderman opposite (Wood) shakes his head at this observation, and I hope I may infer from the motion that the city of London, of which he is a representative, is not unwilling to permit an interference in the regulation of its police. I hope I may infer from it, that he is prepared to give up the privileges claimed by the city of London on this subject. [Alderman Wood said, across the table, "I do not think any such concession necessary."] No, I only wish to improve, not to takeaway, the jurisdiction; and I shall place the worthy alderman in my committee, where I expect considerable benefit from his assistance. I hope this will satisfy him, that if I wish for alteration in the jurisdiction of the city of London, as it regards the management of the police, it is only with a view to improvement. Allowing, for the sake of argument, that we have a tolerably good police during the day, when its services are not so necessary, I must be permitted to observe that at night, when we most stand in need of its protection, it is most defective. The defect proceeds from the want of a uniformity of system; each parish proceeding for itself during the night, in a manner that is very imperfect. It necessarily follows, that separate establishments must be imperfect; and a strong, and perhaps proper, disposition existing in each parish to administer the parochial affairs with great economy, the police of the night is left in a condition scandalously deficient; so that at last, in consequence of its imperfect state, crime
<col>794</col>
has full scope to increase, and private property becomes endangered. Honourable gentlemen have only to look around them to observe what a change has taken place, of late years, in the environs of the metropolis. Within that time our suburbs have grown up to an extraordinary extent, yet no adequate provision has been made for the safety of property, or the administration of criminal justice within their limits. The whole reliance of the inhabitants of those districts is placed &#x2014;not on the police magistrates of London, who are too distant, and too much occupied to afford them assistance&#x2014;but on such gentlemen as reside in the neighbeurhood, and are inclined to act in the commission of the peace. But in some places individuals have to travel seven or eight miles to procure the interference of a magistrate; so that many, balancing the loss of time, the expense, and the inconvenience attending prosecutions, make up their minds to put up with the injury they have received, and abandon all attempts at redress. If a banker loses a sum of 3000<i>l</i>. or 4000<i>l</i> by a coach or other robbery, he adopts a different course, and has, therefore, some chance of a remedy. The compounding of felony is another practice, of which I hope it is unnecessary to say I disapprove. I was applied to, a short time since, by a party from whom an enormous sum of money had been stolen, and was requested to offer his majesty's pardon to any of the accomplices who would give evidence of the robbery: but I at once declared, that I would never impose the prerogative of his majesty on any such occasion, unless I received a full assurance that the parties would ultimately prosecute. I have also uniformly opposed myself to any thing like compounding of felonies, of which we have had not a few examples within a recent period. I am aware that the subject is one extremely difficult to be reached by means of legal enactments, but if penalties can be so framed as to prevent the practice, I shall be extremely anxious for their adoption.<lb/>
In a metropolis where proper facilities are not afforded for the administration of justice, on account of the absence or inefficiency of the magistracy, increase of crime is the necessary result. Without attempting to point out, at the present moment, the particular remedies which it may be desirable to apply, I will observe generally, that I should feel much dis-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0405"/>
<col>795</col>
posed to follow the example of Scotland in regard to prosecutions, and not throw upon the poorer classes, as is the custom in this country, the charge of vindicating themselves against the attacks of offenders, by a costly and tedious appeal to the laws of the country. When a man loses ten pounds, if he finds that it will cost him twenty pounds to prosecute the plunderer, the chances are that he declines to do so. Until, therefore, criminal justice shall be made cheap and easy to the sufferer, crime may be expected to increase. In Scotland, an individual is released from the necessity of prosecuting a criminal, by the appointment 'of a public officer for that purpose, who, apart from malice and private considerations, is bound to execute his duty with impartiality and firmness. But, when an individual is obliged to prosecute, as is the case in this country, at his own hazard, prudential considerations may induce him to refrain from bringing the offender to justice. I throw out these hints as matters which I think worthy of the consideration of the House as well as of the committee; although I do not believe that any effectual remedy can be devised by which the evil can be cured. The introduction of such a system would cause too great a change in our whole internal system. But when the committee have fully sifted the whole question, they will find that the time is come when these things ought to be gravely and seriously looked at. My immediate object in proposing this committee, is an inquiry into the causes of the increase of crime in the metropolis and its vicinity, and into the state of the police of the metropolis. There are so many points of inquiry into the general question, that I think I am doing best, by limiting it, in this way, on the present occasion. But I intreat hon. members, and particularly those who live in agricultural districts, to look seriously to the points upon which I have found it necessary to touch. Sir, I think&#x2014;and it is useless to disguise the fact&#x2014;that the time is come, when, from the increase in its population, the enlargement of its resources, and the multiplied development of its energies, we may fairly pronounce that the country has outgrown her police institutions, and that the cheapest and safest course will be found to be the introduction of a new mode of protection. Why, I ask, should we intrust a grocer, or any other tradesman, however respectable, with the direc-
<col>796</col>
tion and management of a police for 5,000 or 6,000 inhabitants? Why should such a person, unpaid and unrewarded, be taken from his usual avocations, and called upon to perform the laborious duties of a night constable? I say, Sir, that he has no reward; or, if he has a reward, he has it from improper sources; and this, I contend, is an argument in favour of the inquiry I propose. I am aware, Sir, that abuses exist in the watch and police systems. I am aware, that after having employed a man for twenty or thirty years, they know not what to do with him, or how to provide for him, and therefore they continue him in his employment, no matter how unfit for it he may have become.<lb/>
I shall now, Sir, allude shortly to certain documents which I shall feel it my duty to lay before the committee. These documents shew the increase of crime in England and Wales in 1827, compared with 1826. Sir, it is of no use to deceive ourselves: it is of no use to shut our eyes against what is passing around us, and to praise ourselves upon our superior morality and Christian virtues. It is our duty to look around us, and to provide, so far as in us lies, remedies for the evils with which we are surrounded. By doing this, we shall best consult the interests of the country at large. In order to shew the House the state of crime in the metropolis, I shall take leave to read the amount of commitments within the last few years. In 1823, the total number of commitments, in England and Wales, was 12,263; in 1824, it was 13,698; making an increase of more than 1,400 criminals. In the next year, 1825, the number was 14, 437; making a still further increase, in the last year, of 739. In 1826 the number was 16,147; in 1827 it was 17,921; making an increase of 1,774 in the last year. From these statements, Sir, it is evident that there has been an increase of crime, in the last five years, to the amount of 5,000 persons. This, I say, is evident, from the documents I have just read. The last contains the number of commitments in 1826, as compared with those in 1827, shewing the decrease which has taken place in several counties. Perhaps the House may have the curiosity to know what are the counties in which a decrease of crime has taken place. In those comities (although there has been a general increase of 1774 in the sum total of the commitments in England and Wales
<image src="S2V0018P0I0406"/>
<col>797</col>
for the last year) there has been a decrease within the last year as compared with the former year, in the amount of commitments. These counties are Devonshire, Gloucestershire, the city of Bristol, the counties of Huntingdon, those of Middlesex and London, in which the decrease is as great as 76; and lastly, the counties of Rutland and Surrey. The total decrease is only 157, and out of that number the counties of Middlesex (including London) and Surrey, furnish the proportion of 112; so that in the other counties the decrease has been but very slight. On the other hand, there has been an increase in several counties of so large a nature, as far to exceed the decrease to which I have just referred. That increase, in 1827, as compared with the number of committals in the same counties, in the preceding year, may be thus stated:&#x2014;In Cheshire the increase has been 82; in Lincolnshire 108; in Lancashire 85 (a number not very large, considering the population of that county, and the peculiar circumstances in which that population are placed); in Somersetshire 156 (an increase larger than that which has taken place in any other county of the same size); in Staffordshire, 121; in Yorkshire, 227; and in Worcestershire 81; by which, together with other counties, the increase amounts in the gross to 1,774. These, Sir, are some of the counties in which the increase has taken place; but in all of them that increase has been considerable. In Kent and Cardiganshire, by a curious and fortuitous circumstance, the relative numbers have continued precisely the same. From this enumeration I do not attempt to draw any of those inferences, for which it seems to offer so wide a field, and which theorists are so ready to adduce. It seems to me, that none can be safely drawn from them, either upon the general subject of distress, on that of the Game-laws, or on that of the facility of commitment, without, at the same time, taking into consideration a vast many points of inquiry, too numerous for me to touch upon at present.<lb/>
These, Sir, are the points which appear to me to deserve the strictest examination, and which I have no doubt will obtain such examination from the committee which a noble lord had got appointed last session, to inquire into the Causes of the increase of crime in the country; and from the returns which I have this night read to the House, and
<col>798</col>
from others of a similar nature, which may afterwards be moved for. I think that the causes may hereafter be ascertained very satisfactorily. I ought to apologize to the House for having intruded so long upon its patience; but the deep interest which I naturally take in this subject has led me into a larger field than I ought, perhaps, to have traversed, seeing that the inquiry which I am about to propose is limited to the causes of the increase of crime in London and the vicinity, and to the state of the police for its detection and prevention. I feel, however, that the subject matter of the inquiry is connected with objects of such deep importance, not merely as they regard the security of individual property, but also as they regard the morals and habits of the entire population, that it will be my excuse for having trespassed so long on the time of the House. I now move, Sir, "That a select committee be appointed to inquire into the causes of the increase of the number of commitments and convictions in London and Middlesex for the year 1827; and into the state of the police of the metropolis and the districts adjoining thereto; and to report their observations thereupon to the House."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00546"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> contended, that the right hon. gentleman, as well as the committee which the noble lord had obtained last year, to inquire into the increase of crime in the country, had shut their eyes to the real causes of it, and had blinked the only question into which it was important for the people that they should institute an inquiry. He was satisfied that the decreased wages paid to labourers, which, in some instances, was reduced two-thirds, and in others one-half, compared to what they were, was one great cause of the increase of crime; but the great evil of all was, excessive taxation. He had heard it stated by the right hon. Secretary, that the increase of our manufactures was one of the causes of increase of crime. He was of a different opinion.&#x2014;He believed the increase arose from the general want of employment, occasioned by that over taxation which was grinding all classes of the community. We were now paying upwards of sixty millions for taxes annually; and there was but little hope of the evils being removed till that amount was greatly reduced. Another cause of these evils was the emigration of the starving Irish to this country; the conse-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0407"/>
<col>799</col>
quence of this was, that our peasantry, by having their wages reduced by the competition thus introduced, were driven to the commission of crimes. He, therefore, said that ministers had blinked the real cause of these evils; for, unless taxation was reduced, it would be useless to expect that property could be protected from the attacks of men who were starving. He intreated the right hon. Secretary to look boldly at the situation of this country and Ireland. He would say, pacify Ireland, and there would then be no necessity for having a large garrison in that country. He would also say, keep from this country the immense flocks of labourers who were daily coming hither to the injury of her native inhabitants by the introduction of Poor-laws, if no better means could be demised. He did not mean to object to a committee; but he was apprehensive that no good would be derived from it. The remedy was with the ministers, and consisted in a reduction of the taxes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00547"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> said, that, as his noble friend, the marquis of Lansdowne, had intended to have brought under the consideration of parliament the very question which had been so ably submitted to it that evening by the right hon. gentleman, who had succeeded him as Secretary of State for the Home Department, he felt it to be a duty which he owed to his noble friend, not to remain entirely silent. He would commence by stating, that in almost every word which the right hon. gentleman had said he entirely agreed; but he must, at the same time, take the liberty of urging the right hon. gentleman, with respect to one branch of it, which was of paramount importance, not to approach it either with timidity or apathy. Every man, who had paid the slightest attention to the practical operation of our criminal laws, would readily acknowledge, that one of the great impediments to any efficient improvement of them, was to be traced to the multiplicity and diversity of the peculiar jurisdictions which were now employed in the detecting of crime. When he looked either at the state of the parochial watch, or at the peculiar regulations of the police in the city of London, he felt convinced, that the House, on coming to deal with a question so important to the security and property, and to the moral feelings of the population, would not allow any partial or parochial jurisdiction to stand in the way of their doing what was right to their constituents, and of their advancing the essen-
<col>800</col>
tial interests of public justice. He was well aware, that when the condition of the police was brought under the notice of parliament, first by sir A. Macdonald, who was then Solicitor-general, and afterwards by a right hon. gentleman (Mr. R. Ryder) who once filled the office of Home Secretary, and who still retained his seat in that House, the state of the nightly watch was a circumstance, which they both declared it to be their intention to alter and improve. There was then a reluctance on the part of the House to interfere in the regulation of establishments which had been so long part and parcel of the regular institutions in the land; but he was happy to say, that at present there was a great alteration of opinion upon that point, and that those who formerly looked with jealousy on any interference with their exclusive rights, would not stand in the way of improvement, if it could be proved to their satisfaction that some part of their rights ought to be sacrificed for the advantage of the public. If, however, they should be obstinately attached to their old system, and should declare that they would on no account willingly lend themselves to the accomplishment of schemes which were considered schemes of improvement, he trusted that in the age in which they lived, and in which opinion exercised so extensive and beneficial a sway, the Commons of England would not allow any grand objects to be frustrated by the paltry jealousy, either of parochial or of corporate bodies. He would therefore declare at once, that it was his opinion that it would be impossible to make any substantial improvement in the condition of the police, so long as the parochial watch was allowed to continue under its present system of management. That system was objectionable, as it was under the control of a set of officers who were annually appointed and annually changed. To make the watch really useful and efficient, it should be permanent in itself, and should be under the control of permanent, and therefore responsible authorities. It should likewise be free from the interference of all persons who had anything to do with the administration of the Poor-laws; for what useful result could be expected from it, when those who had the appointment of it, instead of seeking to prevent crime, sought to diminish the Poor-rates by enrolling individuals on the watch, in order to prevent them from coming upon the parish?&#x2014;He was of opinion that hitherto, in considering
<image src="S2V0018P0I0408"/>
<col>801</col>
the state of the metropolitan police, the House had limited its inquiries much too narrowly. They had limited them to the state of the police in London and Westminster only; and, therefore, just in proportion as the police was improved in those places in consequence of the inquiries instituted by the House, did crime increase in the neighbouring villages and the surrounding counties. They drove the perpetrators of crime from the parishes in the metropolis: but what was the result? Why, that they sought and found refuge in the parishes in its outskirts, and that immediate complaints were made in those parishes of the increase of crime. He was of opinion that those who supposed that the country was to be at, the entire expense of supporting a police for the parishes in the counties adjoining the metropolis, laboured under a mistake of which they could not be cured too rapidly. Every body agreed that the country ought to pay for the expense of the police of the metropolis; but he thought that the counties adjoining to the metropolis had not the same claim on the purse of the country, and ought, therefore, to eon-tribute towards the defraying of the expense of it themselves. There was another circumstance connected with the increase of crime, which had attracted the attention of former committees, and ought to attract the attention of all future ones: he alluded to the system of licensing public-houses. As long as things remained as they now were in London, where, from causes which had been adverted to, the state of the magistracy was not so satisfactory as it was elsewhere,&#x2014;as long as they had a system in existence which placed out of their control certain houses, were they ever so bad, and gave them no power to license other houses were they ever so good&#x2014;so long would it be impossible to consider that they had in such a district any security against the increase of crime. It was a notorious fact, that certain houses were nothing better than dens for thieves, in which crimes were planned and robberies devised with the most unblushing effrontery; and yet it was a fact equally notorious, that if such houses were the property of certain individuals, they were quite secure from all control. Let the House only consider how the prevalence of such an idea was calculated to impair the respect which ought to belong to the magistracy. If the public saw that no confidence could be reposed in the magistracy on account
<col>802</col>
of the improper manner in which they discharged one part of their duty, would it be inclined to extend its confidence to them for the mode in which they discharged the other?&#x2014;There was another point connected with this subject, into which he thought the committee should also be directed to inquire: he meant the extent of juvenile delinquency. Without looking attentively into that point, he thought it would be quite impossible for the House to check the progress of crime. He was ready to admit that much had already been done by the right hon. Secretary to improve the system of prison laws; but there was, unfortunately, such a large class of juvenile offenders, that the system of confining them together, merely because they were young, was subversive of every principle of prison discipline, which tended to retard the increase of crime. In London the number of juvenile delinquents was at present so enormous, that it would be quite impossible to diminish it, unless a prison was erected in which they could be classed, not according to their age, but the degree of their crime. Besides these, there was another point, which, sooner or later, must come under the consideration of parliament: he meant the secondary mode of punishment, by transportation. If any gentleman could see the letters which were written by the convicts in New South Wales and Van Diemen's land, to their friends at home, and peruse the description which they gave of their condition in those colonies, they would see that nothing could be clearer than that transportation afforded encouragement to crime. It was not one, but a hundred letters, which he had seen, in which the convicts had used such language as this to their friends:&#x2014;"We are in a situation here far more comfortable than we ever were at home. We are better off in this country than you, who are convicted of no offence, can ever hope to be in England; and the best wish we can make you is, that you may be enabled to join us here without delay." Now, if such were the representations of the convicts, was it possible that transportation could operate as a check upon crime?&#x2014;During the time that his noble friend the marquis of Lansdowne had been in office, he had introduced an alteration in the police regulations of the metropolis, to which he would call the notice of the House. It might not perhaps, be generally known, that there was a publication called the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0409"/>
<col>803</col>
"Hue and Cry:" it gave an account of the offences committed within certain districts of the metropolis, and had a certain but limited sale. The mode in which it was published, seemed not to answer the purposes for which it was designed, and his noble friend had made an alteration in it, which, though it gave it a more frequent issue, was also calculated to give it a more extensive circulation. He would suggest to the right hon. Secretary the propriety of carrying that publication much further that it had yet been carried. It would have been carried further during the last autumn, had not the interposition of Parliament been necessary to sanction the expense to which it must of course put the country. The scheme proposed was this: to transmit a paper containing a description of the thief, of the property stolen, and of all the indicia of the crime, to every keeper of a public-house, to every licensed dealer in horses, and to every pawnbroker in the country; so that immediately after a crime was committed, there might be a description of the criminal placarded, as it were, in every town in the empire. The benefit of such a plan would consist in its giving a ubiquity to the police, far greater than any which it had ever before possessed. It was as yet imperfect in its details; but he implored the right honourable Secretary to give it his attention, if it had not already received it. He admitted that it was lamentable to consider the increase of crime which had taken place during the last year; but, lamentable as it was, he thought that it was not such as to fill us with despondency and despair. In the first place, it appeared from the returns, that whilst the number of offences had increased, their enormity had diminished. He looked upon that circumstance as a decisive proof of the improvement of the state of society. But, supposing that the increase of crime was more decisively marked than it was at present, it ought not to be forgotten, that the increase of crime must always depend on the proportion of temptation to commit it. Now, if the House considered the immense increase of property which had taken place within the last few years, and the careless manner in which property was now-a-days exposed in the public streets for sale, it would get directly at one cause of the increase of crime. Besides, we ought to recollect, that in our calculations, we were dealing with crime as it was exhibited to us by criminal proceedings; and nothing
<col>804</col>
could be more clear, than that every step which we took to facilitate prosecutions was a step towards the increase of their numbers, and consequently towards the increase of crime, as it appeared upon paper. It followed, from the right hon. gentleman's own acts that many crimes were now prosecuted which were not prosecuted formerly; and if the right hon. gentleman should be inclined to try the experiment which he had mentioned to the House, and which worked so well in practice in Scotland&#x2014;he meant the adoption of the Scotch system of a public prosecutor,&#x2014;he would venture to predict, that without the increase of a single offender, they would have a great and surprising increase in the return of crime.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00548"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. member for Montrose was always trying to induce the House to believe, that the cause of all the distresses of the country was its taxation, and that its only hope of relief from those distresses was in the remission of that taxation. A reduction in the expenditure would not affect the low rate of wages, which was caused by the existence of a redundant population. The lower classes were distressed because their capital and labour did not meet with a sufficient demand. A reduction in the taxes would not meet that evil. As long as persons were out of employment, a remission of taxation would not raise the general condition of the mass of the labouring poor. Other remedies must be resorted to for the removal of that evil. This was a subject of vital importance, and he should reserve himself for other opportunities during the session to enter more at large into the various details connected with it. There was another subject upon which he wished to say a few words. He had often heard it asserted, that the immediate effects of the passing of that measure, in which Ireland was so deeply interested, would be the introduction of capital, and the establishment of manufactories, in that kingdom. Yielding to no man in the deliberate conviction, that the passing of that measure would put an end to a class of evils which might be referred to certain moral causes existing in Ireland, he would at the same time deny, that the abolishing of those causes would operate as a cure for the redundant population. That redundancy was principally, if not totally, caused by the absence of the demand for labour. When gentlemen talked of the granting
<image src="S2V0018P0I0410"/>
<col>805</col>
Catholic emancipation as the means of throwing manufactures into Ireland, he should be glad to know how it came to pass that the Irish population were not brought over to this country and employed in manufactures? If the manufacturer would not go to Ireland, what was to prevent the Irish from coming here? Now, what was the fact? The Irish did come over here, and came over in shoals, and so reduced the price of labour, that, in the end, the population of this country will be brought to a similar state of distress and misery as the population of Ireland. While gentlemen looked to moral effects, and endeavoured to remove the moral causes which operated to produce those effects in Ireland, they should also direct their attention to the practically operating causes of the present condition of the labouring classes there. The sub-letting act, if carried fairly into effect, was calculated to, produce the most beneficial consequences in Ireland. The Poor-laws, if that portion which applied to the employment of able-bodied men were repealed, would likewise be productive of the greatest benefit. The effects, however, which they witnessed, would continue as long as a redundant population existed. The only hope for the House was, fairly to look at the state of the population, and to discuss the causes to which that condition was attributable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00549"><member>Sir E. Knatchbull</member><membercontribution> said, he felt himself called upon to address a few observations to the House, particularly after what had fallen from his right hon. friend, in allusion to the county of Kent. His right hon. friend had said, that he considered the situation of this country was nearly approaching that state in which the population had outgrown the institutions of the country. He would take the observation in the qualified sense in which his right hon. friend intended to use it, applying it only to the police institutions. In that observation he entirely accorded; and he was gratified to learn from his right hon. friend, that he had no reason to extend it further. He had heard with satisfaction, that this inquiry was not to apply exclusively to the metropolis, but was to be extended to the towns in the neighbourhood of that great city. He rejoiced at this circumstance; for whatever might be the difficulties which the police of the metropolis had to struggle with&#x2014;however arduous might be the duties of the magis-
<col>806</col>
trates who presided in the offices&#x2014;he was afraid that the obstacles to the administration of justice in the metropolis were not greater than those which existed in the towns in its vicinity. He would mention, in particular, the town of Greenwich. In no part of the kingdom was the inquiry more requisite. The same remark would apply to Chatham and Sheerness, in spite of the meritorious exertions of the gentlemen in the commission of the peace; and he would take that opportunity of saying, that the magistrates of Kent had generally discharged their important duties in the most satisfactory manner. He believed no set of men deserved better of their country. He was anxious to make this observation, in consequence of some statements made, on a late occasion, by a learned gentleman (Mr. Brougham), and which it would have been well to have answered at the time, if the opportunity had allowed of it. He would, however, not say one word more on that point, as the question would come on again to-morrow. The hon. gentleman who had spoken last but one, had stated, that culprits who had been transported, had written to their friends in such a style as induced the opinion, that that mode of punishment was not severe. He was of an entirely different opinion. It had happened to him to have read communications on the same subject; but of all those communications he had never seen one which was not accompanied by expressions of regret at the loss of the society of their friends, and their removal from their native country. But if transportation was not a sufficient punishment, what would the hon. gentleman substitute? Surely he was not friendly to the system of confining men on board of the hulks. It had been tried, and had been found to fail. With respect to the Game-laws, no one could be more hostile to the present system than himself. No subject was more deserving of the attention of the House. As to his right hon. friend's act relative to prosecutions, it had caused a considerable increase in the expenditure of the counties. At the same time it had occasioned a great increase in the number of commitments. He thought his right hon. friend would do well to re-consider that part of the act, which gave such facility to prosecutors in obtaining their expenses. He entirely concurred with his right hon. friend, that there was no ground for despondency while that House acted
<image src="S2V0018P0I0411"/>
<col>807</col>
firmly and honestly. He hoped also that a fair construction would be put upon the conduct of the magistracy. It was one of the greatest securities in this country that it had an unpaid magistracy, far removed above all suspicion of injustice, and disposed to carry justice home to the doors of every individual in the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00550"><member>Dr. Lushington</member><membercontribution> said, that the act of parliament passed for the regulation of prison discipline had been completely evaded by the magistrates of Middlesex. Last session he had moved for the report of the visiting magistrates in 1825, and it was frightful to see how the prisons had gone on increasing in iniquity, while no remedy had been applied to the evil. That Report stated, that riots and assaults were of daily occurrence in Cold Bath Fields prison; that incorrigible offenders were often confined with those who were comparatively guiltless, and frequently discharged without prosecution. In consequence of receiving this information, he had gone, in October 1826, to that prison to ascertain whether it could be true. He then saw eighty or ninety prisoners confined in one room, and the sleeping place allotted for each was about sixteen inches, in breadth. The greater portion of them, went to sleep in a perfectly naked condition. When he inquired why such a number of human beings were thus pent up in one room, the superintendent stated, that there was no other place for them. He understood from him, that when he went to open the door of this room in the morning, he was nearly overpowered by the smell, and was obliged to leave the door open for several minutes before he could enter; such was the dreadful stench which issued from the apartment. The condition of this prison still remained unaltered. No remedy had been applied but one, which, to the honour of the magistrates of Middlesex, was unique in its way. They dismissed the whole body of the visiting committee. Undoubtedly that was rather an extraordinary mode of proceeding, but in justice he must say, that the magistrates had since repented of their rashness, and taken the offenders again into favour. In pursuance of the Consolidated act, relative to prisons, a large book was laid late every year on the table of the House. He had looked into that book, in order to compare its statements with the report of the visiting magistrates; but he had found only four or rive lines, simply stating that the
<col>808</col>
provisions of the act had been complied I with in the prison. Here, then, according to the report, all was well. Where was the use of acts of parliament for the regulation of prisons and prison-discipline, if, where the grossest violations of their enactments were committed, and those evils existed which they were intended to meet, it was thus reported in four or five lines, that the provisions of the act had been complied with? He had also visited the prison of Newgate. The space afforded to the prisoners there was very small, and the classification highly objectionable. In the same little cell would be seen confined one individual committed upon a charge affecting his life, and another whose guilt, if any, was perhaps of a very venial character. The House had heard of the increase of crime, but ought it to excite their surprise when they were told of the scenes of contamination which passed in Newgate? They had only to visit that prison, and there behold, as he had done, three individuals confined in the same cell, one of whom was under sentence of death, whose time was fixed, and who was preparing for his dreadful fate, while the other two prisoners, who were certain of a commutation of their sentence to that of transportation, were cheerful and in high spirits. Was this right? The corporate rights of the city of London ought to be upheld: but they should not be allowed to exist for a moment if they tended to continue such a system as this. There was another point which he wished to suggest for the consideration of the right hon. gentleman. Why should the Old Bailey sessions be confined to the city of London and county of Middlesex? Why should not the jurisdiction of that court be extended to the other side of Blackfriars-bridge, and include persons guilty of offences in Surry and Kent? It might be said, that it was better for the city of London that the expenses attendant upon the trial of such offenders should be thrown upon the counties respectively. God forbid that such an objection should for a moment stand in the way of the due administration of justice&#x0021; As the law now stood, an offender upon the other side of Blackfriars-bridge must, when apprehended, be maintained in prison at the expense of the county until the assizes. The winter assizes had certainly afforded great relief: but if the Old Baily sessions were more equalized, and took in a larger jurisdiction, many existing evils would be remedied,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0412"/>
<col>809</col>
much expense would be saved, and the purposes of justice would be better accomplished.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00551"><member>Mr. D. Barclay</member><membercontribution> said, that a great deal of valuable information was contained in the Report of the Committee of 1817. He had no hope of any material improvement in the police of the metropolis, unless an end was put to the system of parish police. The right hon. gentleman had alluded to the increase of the population, and he agreed that, whoever compared the police establishment with the population, must be convinced that the time had arrived when the state of the police required consideration. An hon. baronet had alluded to the increased expense of prosecutions; and he concurred with that hon. baronet, that it arose in some measure from the increased facility lately given to prosecutions. Townsend, the Bow-street officer, in his evidence before the committee of 1817, had stated, that he remembered when ten and twenty persons at a time "graced the gibbet," while of late years, he said, we had only a paltry example of one or two brought forward; and from this decrease of capital punishment, Townsend inferred the increase of crime. The hon. member was of opinion, that if some protection was given to the parties concerned in the robberies of banks and receiving stolen goods, from the consequence of their own evidence, considerable benefit would result from it. By referring to the report of the committee of 1817, much time might be saved, in the examination of evidence before the new committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00552"><member>Mr. Alderman Wood</member><membercontribution> said, that the establishment of the day-police of the right hon. gentleman was known to have produced great benefit to the public. But the day-police was not new in the city of London. It had existed there for a great number of years. Some allusions had been made to the difficulty resulting from the concurrent jurisdiction exercised by the magistrates of the city with the magistrates of the Borough. But it was impossible that a more general disposition could exist on the part both of the city and county magistrates, to give every facility to the administration of justice. As to the rights and privileges of the city, he could assure the right hon. gentleman, that there would be no difficulty. He would advise him to imitate the police of London. He had heard that night of a parish police. There was no such thing in the city of London. It was
<col>810</col>
all under one jurisdiction&#x2014;that of the corporation. A law had been passed for the regulation of the city police. The general rule was, that no watchman was taken who was beyond forty years of age; and the night-watch throughout the city was liable to the superintendence of the patrol appointed by the corporation. No one ward could act as it pleased. The watchmen belonging to it were under the management of the superintendents, called patrols, paid out of the corporation funds. The marshalmen also exercised an active vigilance and were bound to go round nightly to see that every watchman in London was doing his duty; and that the night constables were also doing theirs. The frequent resolutions of the corporation shewed that they had adopted every necessary measure for the safety of the city. But if people would neglect all common precautions, and lock-up the doors of their counting-houses, with great property in them, leaving not a soul with-inside, what police could defend them? The whole was frequently left under a padlock, which any experienced thief could pick; and in this way property to the amount of 20,000<i>l.</i> or 40,000<i>l.</i> was exposed to danger, because the office-keeper would not render himself liable to some paltry tax, or parish office, by keeping a servant to protect it.&#x2014;It was not the first time he had heard the learned doctor make the same observations as to the state of Newgate. But he had never been able to substantiate one of them. He admitted that that prison was much crowded; and and he, on the part of the city of London, would feel much obliged if the learned doctor would take these prisoners off their hands. It would be a saving of 20,000<i>l.</i> out of the corporation funds. The whole of these prisoners were supported at the expense of the corporation. The charges of the witnesses at the sessions also came out of the pockets of the corporation. But the learned civilian asked, how could so many prisoners be kept in one cell, under sentence of death? The city had nothing to do with that; the Secretary for the Home Department, could better explain how it happened. By next Saturday twenty more prisoners under sentence of death would be added to the forty already in the condemned cells. But what had the city to do with this delay? It arose from the unfortunate state of health of an illustrious person. The city could provide

<col>811</col>
no remedy; they had burthens enough already. They had to maintain State prisoners, and prisoners for misdemeanors, according to acts of parliament; and they were obliged, consequently, often to keep a large space for one or two prisoners. Was the city to enlarge Newgate at its own expense? Let not the county magistrates commit so many prisoners to that prison when they knew it was in a crowded state, and much of the evil might be avoided. The judges did all in their power to relieve it, by never sentencing to it any prisoner to a term of confinement, except in some very peculiar cases. None of the city prisoners were sent to the county prisons; on the contrary, they were all confined in the House of Correction within the city. With respect to the causes of the present defects, he would call the attention of the House to the trials which took place at Newgate. The most trifling charges were sent there to be disposed of; and it was a common thing for boys of from ten to twelve years of age to be convicted of theft. Now was it not dreadful that a child of such tender years should be put on his trial. The payment of expenses for prosecution likewise led to more evils than the House imagined: they would be surprised to hear, that men of title and of rank asked for their expenses &#x2014;not, indeed, in their own persons; but supposing their coachmen appeared against a prisoner for stealing a coat which belonged to the master, the expenses were immediately asked for. This was not as it ought to be; and with respect to the lower classes, it was a great motive with them to prosecute. Another objection to the present system was the transporting criminals for the short period of seven years, in pursuance of which sentence they were sent, on their good behaviour, to the hulks, and were again turned loose on the town, after having plotted, during their retirement, scenes of robberies for succeeding years. He could assure the right hon. gentleman that he was anxious to give every aid in his power to the proposed inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00553"><member>Colonel Wood</member><membercontribution> said, that neither the magistrates of Middlesex nor the police magistrates committed, in the first instance, to Newgate, but to the New Prison, from which, a few days before trial, the prisoners were transferred to Newgate. The learned doctor had complained of the crowded state of the
<col>812</col>
New Prison. He had visited it a few days ago, and was happy to say, that although it had sometimes been in that state, yet he did not find it so then. He had no hesitation, however, in saying, that it was wholly unfit for a prison in its present state, and that it never could be made fit. However great the expense might be, every criminal ought to have a separate cell. At that season of the year, the prisoners were locked up at dusk. Let the House conceive what a situation they must be in, being all shut up together. He thought there should be two prisons; one for commitments, and the other for correction; and as Westminster was going to build a prison, he said, "if Westminster will not come to us, let us go to Westminster;" but it was answered&#x2014;no: it was necessary that they should have a prison of their own. He hoped that this jealousy between Middlesex and Westminster would be done away with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00554"><member>Mr. Alderman Wood</member><membercontribution> said, in explanation, that almost all the committals of the police magistrates were made to Newgate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00555"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, he should confine himself to the facts that had come under his own knowledge. While he filled the office of sheriff, it had been his melancholy duty to witness the execution of thirty-six persons. He also visited Newgate three or four days a week, and never found it in the state described by the learned doctor. The crowded state of Newgate was the city's misfortune, and not its fault, and was attributable to the thousands of prisoners that annually passed through it. Now, as to the increase of crime. If the committee about to be appointed was merely to give facility to prosecutions, then all that it would do would be to multiply prosecutions without removing crime. It was his belief that the greater part of the depredations in the city were committed by juvenile depredators; and he thought that the right hon. gentleman would agree with him, that there were much fewer prisoners sent from London than from Middlesex. If any thing better than the present system could be contrived, he was sure the magistrates of London would concur in it. They had, within the last few weeks, inquired diligently into the system of police in the city, and it was their intention to regulate it in the manner which would give the most effectual security to the inhabitants.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0414"/>
<col>813</col>
As to the increase of crime generally, without speaking of taxation, he should say that it was in a great measure, caused by want of employment. He thought the committee would find this to be the opinion of the magistrates. But it was taxation that had effected this want of employment. Excess of taxation had depreciated property and trade, and had thus effected a great dearth of employment. He believed that parents found it extremely difficult to find employment for their children, more especially for their boys; and it was only necessary to look into the calendar and observe the number of boys who had been committed, and the small articles which they had stolen&#x2014;chiefly articles necessary to subsistence&#x2014;in order to see the consequence of this state of things. Let the committee about to be appointed recollect, that they would do no good by multiplying the number, of committals. Their main object ought to be the prevention of crime, and not the punishment of it. He fully agreed in the propriety of the inquiry. He believed the committee would obtain much valuable information; but he thought that the police of the city of London would be found as perfect and complete as in any part of the kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00556"><member>Mr. Dickenson</member><membercontribution> was sorry to hear that the county of Somersetshire was more prolific in crime than any other county; but though the convictions were more numerous, it was a curious fact that the prosecutions under the Game-laws were less.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00557"><member>Mr. Monck</member><membercontribution> said, that he agreed with the hon. member for Aberdeen, that the increase of crime was in a great measure attributable to the increase of taxation. It would be seen, by referring to p. Statistical Account of France, lately published, that the wages of an agricultural labourer per day were 14<i>d.</i>, and those of a mechanic or artisan 20<i>d.</i>; and yet that the condition of the people was daily improving. In the South of France, those miserable hovels formerly seen were disappearing, and comfortable cottages, with glazed windows, were rising in every direction. How, then, was it that the quantum of wages in France was sufficient to provide the labourers with comfort, while the same quantum here brought our labourers into misery and indigence? The great causes must be the height of taxation, and the enormous price of provisions. In France, bread was but a
<col>814</col>
penny a pound, and butchers' meat under four-pence. On what ground but that of taxation was it that ministers were obliged to have recourse to a Corn-bill? Without that act it would be impossible for England to compete with the continent. Indeed, it was clear, if the plough was to be kept in motion, that we must have prices above those of the continent. With regard to Ireland, he thought that, while that country remained in its present agitated state, it mattered little whether the manufactories were transferred thither, or the Irish labourer came over here to seek employment in them. If she were once tranquillized, capital would be employed on objects of local utility; in the improvement of agriculture, in the construction of canals, and in the draining and reclaiming of bogs; but as long as she was kept in her present state of agitation, no man of sense would trust his property in a country so distracted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00558"><member>Mr. Alderman Thompson</member><membercontribution> said, that the police of London was as efficient as in any other part of the country. As to the increase of crime, he believed one of the causes of it to be the low price of ardent spirits. Another cause was the system of compromising felonies. There was now going on in the city a regularly organized plan of stealing from counting-houses books and securities for money. These were the cases in which felonies were generally compromised. He was not at all surprised that persons whose credit was at stake, should be induced to enter into compromises of this nature. He hoped that the committee would inquire closely into the state of the law on this subject, and especially into the act called "Jonathan Wild's act." To convict under that act was extremely difficult. As to the crowded state of Newgate, he lamented it as much as any one; but he was quite sure that the person to whom the unhappy inmates of that prison were committed, treated them with the greatest humanity. If there was any way in which the crowded state of Newgate could be remedied, it would be a great benefit. He should recommend, that prisoners who had bean tried, and sentenced to transportation, should be sent off immediately.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00559"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, that there was already on the table of the House the report of a committee that had inquired very fully into the crowded state of the prisons, the cause of the increase of crime, and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0415"/>
<col>815</col>
the abuses of the licensing system. If that report were taken, and some practical measure devised, something might be hoped for; but he did not see that much good could be derived from another committee sitting, and contenting themselves with laying another report on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00560"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> replied, and observed, that the hon. baronet was mistaken when he supposed that nothing had taken place subsequent to the report of the committee, of which he had just spoken. He believed that every one of the regulations proposed had been carried into effect. An act had been passed for the improvement of the prison-discipline, and all the provisions of that bill had been acted upon; also an alteration had taken place with respect to the licensing system. An hon. member had complained, that the proposed alterations were only to extend to London and Middlesex; but the hon. gentleman had not understood him aright. His motion was proposed to extend to the metropolis and the districts adjoining thereto; which would of course include a portion of Surrey, Essex, and Kent. When, however, he had referred to the state of crime, as the only documents he had were furnished from the Old Bailey, he had of course been obliged to confine himself to London and Middlesex. He was sorry that the fourth hon. member for London was not present, as no doubt he, like the three worthy aldermen, would have stood up to vindicate the city of London; but he could assure those hon. gentlemen, that he never had the least intention to cast the slightest reflections on the police of the city. All that he had said was, that instead of the police of London being on a concurrent principle, it appeared to act on an exclusive one. With respect to the crowded state of Newgate, that would have been remedied long since, had it not been for a doubt that was entertained, that, by a prescriptive right, arising from long custom, the recorder's report ought to be taken within the limits of London. Steps, however, were taken to relieve the pressure without delay. He had only to observe, that in constituting this committee, he had been anxious to select those magistrates who had been most active in their respective Counties. Several very active members were already too much occupied upon the finance committee to give this the benefit of their labours.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>TEST AND CORPORATION ACTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00562"><member>Lord J. Russell</member> moved the order of the day for the House resolving itself into a committee of the whole House to consider further of the Test and Corporation acts. The noble lord observed, that there was another act which he wished to be referred to the committee, namely, the act of the 16th Geo. 2nd for indemnifying from penalties individuals who had not qualified, according to law, for certain offices. This proposition having been agreed to, the House went into the committee, Mr. Spring Rice in the chair.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00563"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution>, in addressing the committee, observed, that he felt very great satisfaction at the tone and temper by which the former discussion had been marked. He was happy to say, that in no part of it had angry feeling been manifested: on the one side nothing had been introduced that could give offence to the most zealous friends of the church, nor on the other, had any argument been adduced that could wound the feelings of the Dissenters. In such a collision of opinion, on a subject of this nature, some strong expression of feeling might have been expected, but no such feeling had been expressed. Nothing was said, on the one hand, to give pain to the feelings of those who called for the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts; and on the other hand, not one word had been advanced, which could create soreness or irritation in the minds of the right hon. gentlemen who had opposed the measure. For his own part, looking to the question, as a really important question&#x2014;as a question connected with national feeling; as a question which touched, in a very material degree, on the rights of the subject&#x2014;he should not allude to any of those minor divisions which might tend rather to narrow its scope, and to introduce a view of it which it appeared to him to be most desirable to avoid. Indeed, the only part of the question which he thought it necessary to allude to, was the proposition of his hon. friend, the member for Devon (sir T. D. Acland), for a temporary suspension of those acts. This proposition was one of much importance&#x2014;one that deserved deep consideration. In his opinion, to treat the subject in that way would be to tamper and palter with a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0416"/>
<col>817</col>
great question&#x2014;to treat it in a manner unworthy of its magnitude&#x2014;to deal with it in a way that would not be satisfactory either to the Dissenters or to the members of the Church of England. Because, while it would give to the Dissenters the power of connecting themselves with corporations and other establishments, it would still leave them in that state of precarious tenure which formed the great objection to the existing system while, on the other hand, it would interfere in such a way with the securities provided by the Test and Corporation acts, as to create dissatisfaction in the Church of England; for those who were favourable to the securities now in force would fear that, if they were once suspended, they would never again be carried into effect. Thus each party would remain dissatisfied. He therefore thought the committee would be of opinion with him, that if, during the course of eighty-five years, the operation of these acts was, in a great degree, suspended, nothing remained now but to continue the present system or to do it away altogether. The Indemnity act itself, being, as it were, but a half-measure&#x2014;if, in place of it, they introduced a new half-measure, what would be its effect, but to keep the minds of men in suspense on a point of much importance to the liberties of Englishmen? If such a measure was calculated to keep the Dissenters in a state of half security and half suspense, it would be a great pity that a principle of that kind should be acted upon. He hoped, therefore, that those gentlemen of the committee who were disposed to make any alteration in these acts, would go with him the whole length of removing them entirely. The only proposition which he could make was, to supersede them. If the House or the committee differed with him, he had no other proposition to make; and he must say, in candour, that he could not bring himself to agree to a proposition of any other kind.&#x2014;Much had been said, the other night, on the effect which the repeal of these acts was likely to have on another very important question, which had been often discussed in parliament&#x2014;he meant the disabilities under which the Roman Catholics laboured. He was quite ready to confess, that he entertained a feeling that the grievances under which the Roman Catholics laboured were so much greater and so much more galling than any of which the Dissenters could com-
<col>818</col>
plain; that, although if the question of the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts had been brought forward at any time, or under any circumstances, he should have felt it his duty to vote in favour of it, yet he was equally bound to confess, that he never could or would have brought it forward, if he thought that by doing so he was injuring the cause of the Roman Catholics. He did not know what effect this declaration might produce upon the minds of those who were disposed to support the present question; but he thought it was due to himself to declare it; and he had never kept his opinions upon the subject a secret from the Dissenters. He had informed them last year, when he was requested to undertake the management of the application for a repeal of the Test and Corporation acts, that he was then ready to bring the question forward; but that he could not pledge himself specifically, unless with the reservation, that if any thing arose which was likely to prove injurious to the Catholic question from the agitation of the subject, he was not to be called upon to undertake the part of their advocate. He did not, however, think that the agitation of the present question was liable to the objection which had been made to it by some of the hon. gentlemen opposite. In the first place, and as a matter of general principle, their views were precisely the same. The petitions of the Roman Catholics for the settlement of their claims, and the petitions of the Protestant Dissenters praying that they might be relieved from civil disabilities, all commenced in nearly the same terms, and bottomed in the same principle; namely, that men ought to be indulged in the free exercise of their religious belief, unmolested by any restraint with respect to their civil privileges. He would, therefore, contend, that if in this case, he pledged the House to a feeling of this kind&#x2014;if he thus far attached the House to a principle of general liberty, with regard to religious belief&#x2014;undoubtedly he considered it a very great step in favour of the Roman Catholics. If parliament should say, "Nothing can be alleged against the Dissenters, and therefore those laws shall be abrogated;" and if they afterwards decided against the Roman Catholics, who held no doctrines, who harboured no feelings, against the constitution, whose only crime was, that they adhered to a particular religious be-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0417"/>
<col>819</col>
lief&#x2014;if they decided against the admission of the Roman Catholics to civil privileges&#x2014;he could not very well conceive on what fair ground such a decision could rest. He admitted, that, between the two cases, there were points of difference; but still, he could not but think, that, in the end, the argument came to that which he had stated. One point struck him very forcibly, and it was this&#x2014;that if the present motion were conceded, many would look to the other great question with a better temper than they were at present disposed to do.&#x2014;Again, it had been said, that by bringing forward this question, he was producing a great and serious evil&#x2014;that he was pursuing a course which would create dissention between the Protestant Dissenters and the Church of England, which would break down that kind feeling that had, for several years, prevailed between them. Now, his answer to this was, that his object was not to prevent but to perpetuate the feeling of kindness which had so long animated those two bodies. Indeed, when individuals imagined that there was anything in the present motion which was likely to operate against a general feeling of harmony, he laboured under an error. Good evidence could be at once produced to the contrary. Let gentlemen look to the petition of the Roman Catholics of Ireland. They called on the House to repeal the laws which were now under consideration. They were merely lookers-on. In this particular question they had no direct interest. It was known that the Test acts had been done away in Ireland. And what was the result? Why, since that time, it was admitted on all hands, that a growing good feeling had been manifested between the Dissenters and Protestants of Ireland. If such had been the effect of the repeal of the Test acts there, he could not see why the same effect should not be produced here. He thought, after the great majority which sanctioned this proposition the other night, there was no wiser course for the Church of England to pursue, than that of agreeing immediately, and with a good grace, to the repeal which had been so decidedly called for. He trusted that this would be done&#x2014;that no cavil would be made&#x2014;that the friends of the Church of England would impute no sinister design to the Dissenters, but that they would receive them as good subjects&#x2014;as men who loved the constitu-
<col>820</col>
tion&#x2014;as a body whose innocence of all malice to the church must be admitted. Such should be their feelings, until by some unexpected conduct on the part of the Dissenters themselves, it might be deemed necessary&#x2014;a thing which he could not conceive&#x2014;either to continue the present statutes, or to re-enact others of a similar kind. The noble lord concluded by moving,<lb/>
"That so much of an Act of the 13th of Charles 2nd, entitled, 'An Act for the well-governing and regulating of Corporations,' and so much of an Act of the 25th Charles 2nd, entituled, 'An Act for preventing dangers which may happen from Popish Recusants', and of another act of the 16th Geo. 2nd, for amending the last mentioned act, as require the person or persons in the said acts described to take or receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper according to the rites or usage of the Church of England, for the purposes therein expressed, or impose any penalty, forfeiture, incapacity, or disability, by reason of any neglect or omission so to do."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00564"><member>Sir T. D. Acland</member><membercontribution> said, that having been alluded to so particularly by the noble lord who had just sat down, he felt it necessary, in order to guard against misapprehension, to explain what he had stated on a former evening. After what had already passed, it was impossible not to see that, in the opinion of the House of Commons, some decisive steps ought to be taken in the alteration, amendment, or repeal, of these laws, and that the more speedy these measures were, the more soothing would they be to the parties interested, as well as the more effectual for their objects. He was pleased to hear the noble lord call upon the House to legislate upon that question, not as one affecting the interests, or supposed interests, of one party only, but as one of great and general importance. The House had already, by a most marked and he believed, unexpected majority, shewn the sense it entertained, for the just claims of the Dissenters; but he believed he was warranted in saying, that amongst many, if not the great majority, of those who voted for going into the committee, there prevailed the greatest difference of opinion, as to the mode in which the proposed relief ought to be afforded. He had contended, when the question was brought forward very recently, that the interests and feelings of the Established Church were, in this matter, entitled to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0418"/>
<col>821</col>
special consideration; and he had thought it not amiss to remark, that in a case in which, confessedly, great weight was given to the feelings displayed by the Dissenting body, in refraining from pressing on the attention of the House matters deeply affecting their interests generally, that the feelings manifested by others&#x2014;manifested by a body which had been cherished for centuries by the country&#x2014;were worthy of similar consideration. For his own part, he trusted he had shewn, by his vote and his speech, that he did not attach any undue weight to the alarms of that Church, but wished to try the question between them and those others who were affected by the laws, with impartiality&#x2014;to strike a balance between them as evenly as he could, and to give to both the attention and consideration which they deserved. There was another reason why he would not act on this proposition, without a due regard to the feelings of the Church; and it was, because the decorous, wise, and dignified silence, which had been observed on this occasion by that body, constituted a special claim on the consideration of the House, and he hoped the Commons of Great Britain would not be slow in attending to that claim. He was particularly entitled to state this, because he had said, on a former evening, that he did not think the eight-and-thirty years silence of the Dissenting body formed any bar against their claims. But the House might be assured, that, although the Church had been silent upon this subject, it was far from being indifferent, and that for many years past the greatest solicitude had been felt by its members. On this point he begged leave to adduce the authority of Mr. Justice Blackstone; whose dictum on this subject had almost passed into a proverb. That distinguished lawyer had called these two acts "the bulwarks of the Established Church" [cries of "No, no."]. He thought this point was a matter of so much notoriety, that there was no necessity for any explanation. But, as the fact was challenged, and as he had taken the passage down, he begged leave to read it. Mr. Justice Blackstone, then said, "In order the better to secure the Established Church against perils from non-conformists of all denominations, Infidels, Turks, Jews, Heretics, Papists, and Sectaries, there are, however, two bulwarks erected called the Corporatoin and Test acts." Such was the opinion of Mr. Justice Blackstone; and he must say, that
<col>822</col>
the silence of the Dissenters for thirty-eight years, with respect to those laws, had, particularly as churchmen were concerned, drawn the eyes of the public from them, and led to error with reference to them. The suggestion, therefore, which he had thrown out, with respect to the policy of a Suspension bill, he would adhere to as a just one. That course of proceeding would afford an opportunity to individuals to acquire more correct views than generally prevailed on the subject at present. He confessed he did not think the principle of suspension was the best course; but he would rather see some measure proposed of a moderated character, which would have a fair chance of passing both Houses of parliament; which would render unnecessary the calling the attention of parliament to the subject again, and which would close up for ever the sources of animosity that had been long existing, and which, though they had the appearance of healing, might, by injudicious treatment, be rendered more virulent than ever. This he would say to government, that if they allowed the present subject to grow up as a bone of contention, in the same way as another great question had been allowed to grow up, the country would be visited by two plagues instead of one. He must say, that his view of the question had somewhat changed since he addressed the House on Tuesday night. He had turned the subject in his mind, and no man, who considered the question at all, could leave out of his calculation the probabilities of amicably terminating this dispute by any measure that might be proposed. Now, looking to that point he confessed that he could not give his hearty concurrence to this proposition. He did not think that it would answer the intended purpose. They ought not to meet these laws by a simple repeal. How did they act with regard to the Catholic question? Was not every bill introduced for their relief accompanied by some securities? In the bill brought forward in 1825, was there not an oath introduced, which was to be taken by Catholics who might be appointed to any situation under government, disclaiming all hostility to the existing establishment? That oath, almost <i>totidem verbis</i>, had been taken by the Irish Roman Catholics for the last thirty or forty years. Why, it might be asked, did he cite this? Why, because he considered that the compliance by the Dissenters, with some such
<image src="S2V0018P0I0419"/>
<col>823</col>
declaration as this, would have the effect of removing much of the fear, and creating much of that confidence among the members of the Established Church, which he thought necessary to the perfect success of their desires. There was, then, a practical mode of relief for the Dissenters, combined with perfect security to the Established Church. But he would say, that if the present parliament put an end to the Test and Corporation acts, without any protection being given to that Church, very little satisfaction would be given to the people; and he conceived that it would be very difficult to have such a bill passed into a law. If, in the course of the proceeding of the bill through the House, either that which he had pointed out, or any other equivalent provision was made, he, for one, should be exceedingly rejoiced to see thereby an end put to the existing system; but he could not consent to the unqualified repeal of these acts. The object which he had in view might be attended by a bill of suspension, which would afford security to the Church, and at the same time, free the Dissenters from every annoyance. It was not his intention himself to propose such a measure; but if the bill which might hereafter be proposed to the House did not meet with approbation, it might be well to consider whether the government itself ought not to take a step in the business.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00565"><member>Lord J. Russell</member><membercontribution> agreed entirely with his hon. friend, that it was a matter of great importance to conciliate the good-will of the Church of England. He was ready to agree to every thing that did not tend to encourage what he considered, to be a very unfounded and mischievous opinion; namely, that these acts afforded any security to the Church of England. He felt a strong objection to the plan of his hon. friend, because it would have the effect of keeping alive those feelings that ought to be suppressed. If a suspension bill were agreed to, the Church of England, on the one side, would look with anxiety for its revival, as their security, while, on the other, the Dissenters would view its enactment as a mark of their degradation. The great reason, however, which induced him to object to such a course was, because it militated against the total repeal of these acts. He thought, however, that there might be introduced into the repeal bill something palatable to the Church, without imposing any ob-

noxious form of proceeding on the Dissenters. If the government would pledge itself to any form of words, which, while it gave sufficient security to the Church, did not wound the feelings of the Dissenters, to that he was ready to agree; but his great object was the entire repeal of the existing laws.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00566"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that when it was considered that it was not until two o'clock on Monday morning that the motion of the noble lord was carried by a majority of forty-four, he thought that a longer period might be permitted to intervene between the success of that motion and the renewal of a discussion in the committee on the important subject to which that motion referred. For himself, he begged to declare that he had been so engaged during the last two days, that he had neither had time to consult with others upon the subject, nor of forming his own opinion conclusively upon it. But, after the decisive majority with which the motion had been carried, he would put it to the noble lord whether, for the sake of having his measure followed up with final success, he would not be disposed to accept some alternative, instead of the absolute and entire repeal of the Test and Corporation acts. The noble lord should bear in mind, that many members who voted for his motion on the former night, voted only for going into a committee upon these acts, but abstained from pledging themselves to go the full length of a total and unqualified repeal of them. To insure the continued support of those members, it would be worth while to consider whether some mode short of repeal might not advantageously be adopted. Another inducement to the noble lord should be found in the natural anxiety the whole House entertained, that those religious animosities which had been alluded to might be entirely removed, instead of being increased, as they would be, if the measure adopted by the legislature was not one of general satisfaction to the whole community. Again, if the redress of a real practical grievance was the object of the noble lord, and not merely the triumph of an abstract principle, would it not be desirable to shape the measure in such a manner as that it would meet the concurrence of both branches of the legislature, and not set them in collision on a subject which might exasperate feelings which they were all anxious to allay. In offering these suggestions, he wished again to be under-

<col>825</col>
stood as neither having concerted with others, nor having yet matured his own opinion upon it. The great point which had been objected to by those who supported the repeal was the principle of the law which made the Sacramental test a qualification for office. This was said to constitute the material grievance: for, although, in admission to certain corporate offices, this qualification was not enforced, yet in other corporations it did operate as a practical exclusion from these offices. Although the law in some instances was overlooked and Dissenters admitted, and although in a few corporations it was enforced, yet these few instances did not shew the whole extent of the grievance: for, in many instances, the apprehension of the penalty being called into existence prevented many Dissenters from aspiring to offices for which, but for such apprehension, they would become candidates. It was difficult, therefore, and, indeed, almost impossible, to ascertain the extent of the practical grievance. This point was forcibly urged on the former evening. In stating this ground he admitted it was entitled to the utmost attention, and therefore he suggested the expediency of not precipitating a decision to night. There was, besides this, another objection. The preamble of the bill was not in unison with the different clauses, but this he would not enter into at present; he would only appeal to the noble lord, if he would be content with the suspension of the acts, so far as regarded the Sacramental test, with the view of obtaining the consent of the whole legislature; and whether it would not be better, in order to put an end to a practical evil, to agree to a measure, though less perfect than might be wished, for the purpose of meeting the wishes of the two houses of parliament. At all events, he thought the question ought to be open for discussion; that no pledge should be given by any member on either side, and that, above all, every thing should be avoided which could excite animosity or angry feelings. He, therefore, appealed to the noble lord, whether it would be prudent to come to a decision on such an important question, after only a few hours' consideration; and hoped that the House would agree to postpone the discussion at least for a few hours.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00567"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> said, he had hoped that the right hon. gentleman would have proposed some measure which the House could
<col>826</col>
adopt, or at least would have pointed but those parts of the bill proposed by his noble friend, which appeared to him objectionable. This, however, he had not done: all he had done was, to ask for delay. He agreed with the hon. member for Devonshire, that the difficulty lay not in devising what oaths might be necessary, but in passing the bill. On his part, he was ready to vote for any security which might be considered necessary for the protection of the Church. He had always expressed the same sentiments when the Catholic question was discussed, and he entertained the same views with regard to this measure. He would agree to any security, provided it did not continue those disabilities of which the Dissenters at present complained; but he was afraid the proposition of the hon. member for Devonshire was not such as he could consent to. As far as he understood him, he seemed to propose a suspension of the laws for a certain time, in order to see the effect which it might produce. He agreed with him, that it was desirable to avoid angry discussion: but who would say, if this measure was only partially decided, that it might not be renewed from time to time, and the discussions become every time more irritating? He could not agree to postpone the question, and hoped that his noble friend would not consent to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00568"><member>Dr. Phillimore</member><membercontribution> said, he supported the repeal of these acts, on the conviction that it was consistent with the best interests of the established church. He regarded the existence of them as a scandal, which for the credit of the Church should be removed. The simple repeal was proposed by the noble lord; as an amendment to that it was proposed by an hon. baronet to suspend these acts. In his opinion suspension or repeal, for a time, could do no good: as when the time for renewing arrived, fresh dissatisfaction and animosity would be naturally evinced. If by a short oath, unobjectionable to the Dissenters, the objections of those who were opposed to the repeal could be removed, he would not oppose it. If the relief at present prayed for was granted to the Dissenters, it would furnish an additional ground for acceding to the claims of the Catholics. In reply to a question which had been put by the right hon. Secretary, on a former occasion&#x2014;why in the bill introduced last session, by an hon. baronet, was it not proposed to release the Dissenters from the operation of the Test and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0421"/>
<col>827</col>
Corporation acts?&#x2014;the reason was, that the object of that bill merely was to raise the Catholics to the level of the Dissenters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00569"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, he had voted a few nights ago most cordially for the repeal of the laws in question; for he was one who did not believe that the established church was at all protected by them. But, whatever his abstract opinions upon any question were, he was bound to adopt that course which he thought, in the long run, most sure to carry his policy into execution. A right hon. gentleman, now unfortunately no more, had stated, last year, that he opposed the repeal of the Corporation and Test acts, because he conceived that that repeal would militate against the general cause of the Catholics: now he had no hesitation to declare, that he believed that right hon. gentleman himself could not have supported the indemnity system, subject to the real case of grievance which had, in the present debate, been made out against it. At the same time he was not himself entirely of opinion, that the objection of the right hon. gentleman to whom he alluded had been without foundation; or that, when the acts before the House were repealed, some slight loss of strength to the Catholic question might not arise. He was no advocate for delay; he would carry both the question before the House and the Catholic question, that very evening, if he could. And, if he saw reason to believe that the repeal of the laws affecting the Dissenters alone could be carried, without endangering that unanimity of feeling which prevailed with respect to religious disabilities, he would support it. But, if there was a doubt upon this point, he should be induced to hesitate. Unanimity of feeling was his first object; and if that could be best secured by the course of suspension, suspension was the policy which he should prefer. If he were put to his election, to support, without any qualification, the proposition of the noble lord, or to reject it, he should undoubtedly vote in its favour; but he wished the noble lord would consider the suggestion of his right hon. friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00570"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> hoped that the noble lord would postpone his motion for three or four days. The resolution declared that it was the opinion of the committee, that the acts should be repealed; therefore, if a bill was brought in upon the report of that
<col>828</col>
committee, it would be inconsistent afterwards to introduce a clause by which the acts were only to be suspended.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00571"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, he was favourable to a total repeal. Any partial measure would only have the effect of keeping the grievance alive. The making the Sacramental Test the qualification to office, was the scandal of the Established Church. There could not be a stronger instance than the one referred to, of the last chief magistrate of London, who, it was well known, was a Dissenter, but was nevertheless obliged to take the Sacrament according to the observance of the Established Church, in order to qualify for office. He had no hesitation in saying, that he preferred the repeal to the suspension. He believed that no cause could make the existence of the laws complained of again necessary; but, if they ever should become so, the parliament of that day would find no difficulty in re-enacting them. Repeal, in his opinion, was the only proper course. It was impossible to suppose, after the decision of Tuesday night, that the Dissenters would rest satisfied with suspension.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00572"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> thought, that as many members had not yet made up their minds as to the course which ought to be pursued, the decision of the question ought, for the present, to be postponed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00573"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> thought that, after the large majority of the other night, there would be no difficulty, at least until they came into committee on the bill. He believed that the object of the right hon. Secretary was conciliation; but he put it to him, whether delay was the way most likely to effect it. They had heard that night of animosities and probable bickerings; but an annual Suspension bill would not allay that irritation: it would tend to keep open jealousy; and if any serious difference did, in the course of time, arise, the friends to the Church might ask the recall of that suspension. He, therefore, thought the best way was to forward the repeal with as little delay as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00574"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> supported the repeal, as the only course likely to satisfy the Dissenters, and as that to which he considered the House had partly consented. It was a remarkable circumstance in the late debate, that not a single member had been found to defend these acts; and if indefensible, they ought not to be continued.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00575"><member>Mr. Perceval</member><membercontribution> understood the proposition of the right hon. Secretary to be made
<image src="S2V0018P0I0422"/>
<col>829</col>
with a sincere view of meeting the wishes of the noble lord. He thought that object would be more forwarded by the postponement of the discussion, than by forcing the House to come to a vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00576"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> regretted the continuance of the debate, as it seemed likely to disturb that harmony which had characterized the earlier stages of their proceedings; but he put it to the noble lord whether a short delay would not be the most consistent? After the unforeseen majority, he was not prepared, and he believed that many other members were not prepared, to say what course it would be most proper to adopt. By the unexpected decision which the House had come to, it became desirable that it should suspend further proceedings for a short time, to consider the whole bearings of the question, and the consequences of that decision. The noble lord would not prejudice his view of the question by consenting to the delay. If he (Mr. P.) had now intended to bring the question of suspension or repeal to a decision, he would have given the noble lord notice. But he had not considered the subject sufficiently. He could not yet say what would be the best course to adopt, for he had strong objections to adopt the suggestion, that an oath should be substituted as a protection for the Church establishment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00577"><member>Sir C. Cole</member><membercontribution> said, he would grapple at once with the objections to the repeal of the Corporation and Test acts. It was said that they were a barrier to the Established Church. If so, they were a barrier of glass, which any man might break to pieces in a minute. It was a great hardship to the Protestant Dissenters of England, that they should have acts hanging over their heads, which did not affect those of Scotland and Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00578"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> said, that if adjournment would promote the measure, and give satisfaction to the Dissenters, he would not object to it. The only question, he maintained, now under consideration, was repeal or suspension. The question of repeal had been fully taken into consideration. It was included in all the speeches, all the arguments, and in the vote of the House. If he thought that by giving time, the House would agree to his proposition, he would most readily accede to it; but he felt quite confident, that no time would suffice to produce a different conviction in those who were now opposed to the repeal.
<col>830</col>
The right hon. gentleman looked only to securities for the Established Church; while his (lord J. R. 's) object was to give satisfaction to both parties&#x2014;the numerous body of petitioning Dissenters, and the members of the Established Church. The right hon. gentleman himself did not know that the suspension would satisfy the party whose interests he considered; but he (lord J. R.) did know that it would not satisfy the Dissenters. He was convinced, after the majority of the other night, that to vote for the suspension would excite greater irritation than if the House had at first refused to take up the subject. With these feelings, considering that the course now proposed was in fact putting the question for suspension or repeal, he must persist in his proposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00579"><member>Mr. Estcourt</member><membercontribution> hoped there would be an adjournment. It had been said, that if any member had been taken by surprise, the supporters of the repeal would consent to an adjournment. He believed that several members were so situated. He should support the suspension of the acts in preference to their repeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00580"><member>Sir E. Knatchbull</member><membercontribution> said, that the right hon. Secretary asked for time, merely to consider the mode in which the measure could be best carried into effect. He concurred in that view, and was sorry that the noble lord had not evinced a similar feeling.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00581"><member>Lord Milton</member><membercontribution> begged to refer the committee to the exact words of the notice of motion given by the noble lord. They were "repeal of the Corporation and Test, acts." What, then, became of the objections of hon. members? Away with these idle pretences; which those who made them knew were pretences; their only object being to regain the vantage ground they had lost, and by delay, to defeat the Dissenters, and not the Dissenters only, but the best interests of the Church.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00582"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> warmly repelled the noble lord's imputations; and declared, upon his honour, that they were wholly foreign to his motives. He had been most unjustly accused of not being actuated by a conciliatory spirit in this discussion. All he would say was, that, after what had passed, he would not only not propose suspension, but would not even accept delay; although that delay was proposed for purposes which, if his proposition had been accepted in the spirit in which it had been made, might have turned out satis-

<col>831</col>
factory to all parties. He would leave the noble lord to take the course which his judgment pointed out to him; declining any delay; but reserving to himself the right, at any future stages of the bill to adopt such measures as might appear to him advisable.&#x2014;The right hon. gentleman shortly after left the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00583"><member>Sir T. Lethbridge</member><membercontribution> applauded the determined and dignified conduct of the right hon. gentleman. He had come down to the House to vote with the noble mover, in conformity with the decision of the majority of the House; and he had hoped that the measure would have been completed with the temper which ought to be observed in considering a question of so much importance. But instead of friendly co-operation, the noble member for Yorkshire had thrown out the symbol, sign, and ensign of hostility.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00584"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution>, in reference to the intimation on the part of the noble member for Yorkshire, that those who wished for the delay of a few days proceeded upon false pretences, said he repelled with indignation the imputation attempted to be cast upon him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00585"><member>Lord Milton</member><membercontribution> begged to state, in explanation, that, when he had heard that some members conceived that the repeal of the acts was not the object of the noble lord's motion he had desired the clerk to give him the book, that he might show the exact nature of the motion; that repeal was the end in view, and that those who Stated the contrary were not correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00586"><member>Mr. V. Fitzgerald</member><membercontribution> observed that the notice was to repeal the acts, but the motion itself had been for a committee to consider them. He regretted the tone manifested by the noble lord who spoke last, and his introduction into the discussion of unauthorized and unjust aspersions upon those who had differed from him. This was the last thing that the noble mover would desire. He hoped there would be a return to the spirit and temper with which the subject had been introduced, and to which it owed mainly the success it had received.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00587"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> intreated the committee to consider the great interests involved in the decision of the present question. He regretted that any irritation had arisen, and trusted it would be allowed to subside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00588"><member>Lord J. Russell</member><membercontribution> regretted the tone which the discussion had assumed. It
<col>832</col>
was his opinion, that as no other proposition but suspension was made, it was needless to defer the discussion. At the same time he did not think that the right hon. gentleman had any other object in proposing delay than the convenience of all parties. He imputed motives to no one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00589"><member>Lord Milton</member><membercontribution> was sorry for what had occurred. He had no intention to excite anger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00590">The resolution was then agreed to. Previous to which several of the ministers retired from the House.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00591"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> expressed his fears that this question, after what had passed, would no longer be discussed without an infusion of party spirit. He regretted the speech which had been delivered by the noble lord, and doubted much whether it would not be doing mischief.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00592"><member>Colonel Davies</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that those who allowed paltry, petty, and personal, feeling to interfere with the broad path of their duty, were unworthy of a seat in that, or in any other House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00593"><member>Sir G. Warrender</member><membercontribution> hoped, that whatever irritation might have been excited, it would not lead to any unfortunate result to this most important question. He must declare, that if any circumstance could induce him to withdraw his confidence from an administration, it would be the circumstance he had just witnessed; namely, the secession of ministers from the House. This was the first time that he had seen all the ministers retire from the House before a decision had been come to on a great question which had been agitating all men's minds. He begged pardon: he saw one minister left.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00594"><member>Mr. V. Fitzgerald</member><membercontribution> thought his hon. friend, could not have heard the speech of his right hon. friend; who had expressed his intention neither to oppose the motion nor to support it. He now learned for the first time that it was a singular course for a minister to leave the House to avoid voting. The discussion was at an end. If he had remained in the House, and a division had been called for, he could not have avoided voting. [Mr. Peel here re-entered the House.]</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00595"><member>Lord F. L. Gower</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. baronet had announced the probability of his withdrawing his valuable support from a minister who was liable to moments of irritation. Now, he must say, that if he found his right hon. friend to be a minister
<image src="S2V0018P0I0424"/>
<col>833</col>
whose blood was so cold that he could not rise under an unmerited attack&#x2014;under the imputation of acting on false pretences&#x2014;he, in his turn, would withdraw his support from him. In his right hon. friend's secession from the House under the circumstances that had taken place, he entirely concurred. He (lord F. L. Gower) did not take the same course, because, though he had voted in the minority on the former evening, yet, seeing the majority against his view of the question, he would, if called upon to decide between suspension and repeal, undoubtedly give his vote for the latter. For these reasons he did not follow his right hon. friend, upon whom, in his absence, the gallant officer had chosen to make a personal attack.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00596"><member>Sir G. Warrender</member><membercontribution> said, that when he commented on the departure of his right hon. friend he was not aware that he had declared his intention of not voting on the question. He was not apt to give way to feelings of irritation, but he supposed that, on this occasion, he had caught the infection. If he had said any thing objectionable, he was sorry for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00597"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that he was occupied very agreeably up stairs when the intelligence was conveyed to him that his gallant friend was ready to withdraw his support from the government; nevertheless, he did not allow the intelligence to disturb his repast. The fact was, that having fasted since nine o'clock that morning, and being completely exhausted, he had retired to take some refreshment. He had returned to listen to the attack which was made upon him, but he feared that he should again provoke the indignation of his gallant friend by pursuing the same course by which it had been excited; for it was his intention to leave the House when the question should be put, if it had not already been put from the chair. When he left the House, he intended no disrespect to the noble lord, or to the committee.</membercontribution></p>

<title>STATE OF THE COMMON LAW.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00599"><member>Mr. Brougham</member> moved the order of the day for resuming the adjourned debate on the
<col>834</col>
motion:&#x2014;"That an humble address be presented to his Majesty, respectfully requesting that it may be his majesty's pleasure to cause a commission to issue, to inquire into the abuses which have been introduced in the course of time into the administration of the Laws of these Realms, and of the Courts of Common-law, and to report on what remedies it may seem fit and expedient to adopt for their removal." The hon. and learned gentleman said, he would take that opportunity of throwing out a suggestion as to the course which the discussion upon the question ought to take. The general subject which he had introduced to the notice of the House might not improperly be divided into several separate heads or chapters. It might happen that some members would desire to touch upon only one of these heads; some, for instance, on the topic of the Welch judges, some upon that of the magistracy, some upon the system of pleading, and others on the proposed interference with the courts of Equity. All these were most important questions, and there would probably be a great deal of discussion upon each of them; but what he was anxious should be done was this&#x2014;that after his hon. and learned friend, the solicitor-general, had made his general reply, which he would have the privilege of doing from his being in possession of the House, if any member should enter upon the discussion of any one of the single topics, no member who followed him should touch upon any; other topic than that one. If this course were pursued, he thought a vast deal of confusion and repetition would be avoided. He was sure that the course he suggested, instead of lengthening the debate, would shorten it, and at the same time render it more useful and fruitful of information.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00600">The order of the day being read,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00601"><member>The Solicitor-General</member><membercontribution> said, that in rising to offer to the House the observations which he felt it his duty to make upon the question, he laboured under no ordinary difficulty. The subject which his hon. and learned friend had brought under the notice of the House was large and embarrassing, being no less than the whole system of municipal law in this country; and further, branching out into the legal policy of the most distant dependencies of the nation. The minuteness of detail with which his learned friend, in the course of his address, explained the various topics which he submitted to the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0425"/>
<col>835</col>
consideration of the House, rendered it extremely difficult for him to compress within the ordinary compass of a speech, and not to fatigue his hearers, all the observations which presented themselves to his mind, on this momentous subject. He would not detain the House with longer preface, as it would be necessary for him, to a certain extent, to enter into considerable detail, but would at once proceed to point out those parts of his learned friend's address, with respect to which he took a view in some degree different from that of his learned friend, and also to state to the House in what portions of the subject he agreed in almost every particular with his learned friend, and was desirous that his propositions respecting them should be carried to a successful result.<lb/>
Before he proceeded further, however, he thought it right to state, that having communicated with the noble lord who presided over the law, and with the right hon. the Secretary of State for the Home Department, he had been given to understand, that there was no objection on the part of the Crown that a commission should issue to inquire into the formation and progress of a suit of law in the superior courts of Wesminster-hall, from its inception to its termination. Further, the Crown had no objection that either that commission, or some other, should inquire into and investigate the state of the law relating to real property, with the view of suggesting, for the consideration of the Crown, or of the House, those alterations which might be necessary&#x2014;if any were necessary&#x2014;with respect to the mode of holding and transmitting real property. In his humble judgment it would be a matter of convenience that there should be two commissions, or that, if there were only one, the two branches of inquiry should be submitted to two different sets of persons. Those persons acquainted with common law, having applied their studies differently from those acquainted with the subject of real property, a great deal of their labour would be thrown away upon the latter question. He believed that if the suggestion which he threw out were adopted, no additional expense would be created, for he apprehended that the labour of the committee appointed to inquire into the formation and progress of a suit at law would be, comparatively speaking, of a light and easy nature; for there were none of the regulations and alterations proposed
<col>836</col>
by his learned friend on this subject, which had not presented themselves, from time to time, to the minds of almost every practitioner of the law, and which had not, he might say, received an universal verdict of assent from the learned persons who had the direction of the courts of law.<lb/>
His hon. and learned friend, in the course of his address to the House, had not given a very favourable picture of the law to which he had professionally applied himself. He accounted for this by supposing that his learned friend being, very naturally, anxious to carry his object, thought it necessary to make a rather over-charged statement of the machinery and different circumstances connected with the administration of the law. He felt it necessary, therefore, before he touched upon the peculiar divisions of labour, and the subject matter to be introduced to the consideration of the commission, to endeavour to set the House right on some of the various points which his learned friend had treated of with much ability and ingenuity, and in some instances with a considerable degree of that raillery which he had always at his command. In the first place, he must say that his learned friend had not given a very fair view of the question, when he was pleased to state that the law, in its present condition, was the same as it had been for ages past. His learned friend had collected together and presented in a very powerful manner to the attention of the House, the various singularities and peculiarities connected with the law. These circumstances, when brought under the notice of the House thus boldly, and without any accompanying explanation, would, doubtless, appear absurd. According to his learned friend, the profession to which he belonged was in the same state in the time of Alfred as it was at the present moment. Now nobody knew better than his learned friend the various alterations which had, from year to year, been grafted on the old laws, those laws had been altered from time time, to meet the gradual wants and exigencies of society, which was the best mode of effecting reforms on such a subject. Amongst other things his learned friend had applied himself to ridicule the forma of ancient writs, which he said were perfectly unintelligible to those upon whom they were served. Now, his learned friend must be perfectly aware that recently an important alteration was made on this subject, which at once set aside his ob-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0426"/>

jection. The alteration to which he alluded was this&#x2014;that the object of the writ was now printed, in the simplest possible form of words at the bottom of the document. Nobody now alluded to the ancient form of the writ, but merely read the printed notice at the bottom of the paper.<lb/>
My hon. and learned friend (continued the Solicitor-general) has stated, in his address to the House, that it was not his intention to make any observations on the laws of real property. He did not, however, adhere to his determination; for in his speech he went largely into the doctrine of real property, and treated it with very great wit, and with as little mercy as he had treated the ancient writs. I do not mean to follow my learned friend through his observations on the subject. I shall only make one or two remarks upon the particular points at which he glanced. I can only say, that I do hope for the sake of the real property of this kingdom, that the substantial part and principle of the existing laws will be preserved, whatever may be done with the forms. No man who has attended to the law of real property&#x2014;the most important branch of our laws&#x2014;can be ignorant that by the power of entail, the estate is locked up during only the life of the present generation&#x2014;that is to say twenty-one years. If, therefore, it be intended that the labours of the commission should merely get rid of the unnecessary expenses attendant upon the legal security and transmission of real property, I most heartily agree with my learned friend, and shall promote the objects of that commission; but I shall oppose it, if the most wholesome doctrine of our law is to be subverted&#x2014;the doctrine that, during the life of the father, the party having the estate for his life, the son and inheritor should have no power of disposing of the estate till it be vested in him&#x2014;that nothing can be done with the estate, although inalienable, until the eldest son come of age, and that he should then be unable to do any thing with it without the consent of his father. Thus no person for the purpose of imposing upon the son, whilst his judgment is weak, and his passions strong, will bargain with him without requiring the consent of his father. The father and the son may be parties to the sale.<lb/>
My learned friend then proceeded to state, that, in his opinion, copyhold tenures were desirable to be got rid of. Really, Sir, in my opinion, all such cases must be
<col>838</col>
left to the individuals, as in other matters of agreement between landlord and tenant. The learned gentleman had compared our laws in this respect with the ancient laws of France, where if you went into different provinces, you found such different laws and customs, as seriously to affect the nature of property and the rights of persons. But surely, Sir, it is too much to say, that the mere customs of particular manors in England have any resemblance to the ancient diversities of laws and customs in the provinces of France; the custom, for instance, that lands descend generally to all&#x2014;the custom that they descend to the youngest son&#x2014;Borough-English&#x2014;does not create any essential difference, or any embarrassment whatever to the people of this country. The parties know very well whether they were born in one manor or in another, and where their lands are situated. If we take up the subject upon the basis of abstract rights and natural equity, I know not that lands might not descend equally to all the children, as is the law at the present day in France. There is nothing contradictory to good sense in this part of our law; and therefore I do not see any necessity for altering these laws of property as the parties are willing to agree to the laws of the manors and places in which they are born. The very tenacity with which these forms and laws have been adhered to, shows at once the affection and veneration which the people have for them, and I see no advantage in alteration commensurate with the inconveniences of the change. There are very few parts of the country in which this anomalous custom of Borough-English prevails; and where it does prevail, the parties may, by will, prevent the descent.<lb/>
One topic on which my learned friend has considerably dilated is, the Court of Chancery. Now, I will at once say that I do not mean to make a single observation on that part of the subject; first, because my learned friend, in setting out, disclaimed any intention of calling the House to come to a decision respecting the Court of Chancery, which is already in the hands of another hon. and learned member; and secondly, because I conceive it to be foreign from the purposes for which the commission is required; namely, to investigate the conduct and management of a cause from its commencement to its termination, and the state of the law regarding real property. My learned friend wishes
<image src="S2V0018P0I0427"/>
<col>839</col>
the question of the jurisdiction of the courts of civil law to be brought under the review of the commission. This may be a subject worthy of the consideration of government. Some beneficial alterations may perhaps be made respecting those courts; but at the same time I do not think that an inquiry into that subject can, with propriety, rank itself amongst the labours of the present commission; indeed, I am of opinion that it would rather retard the beneficial result of their labours. My learned friend has expressed his objection to the mode of constituting the judges in those courts. Whether the mode of appointing those judges be capable of improvement, I will at present, neither affirm nor deny; but I will assert what I think no one will be disposed to deny, namely, that the men now acting as judges in the courts, carry with them the approving voice of the profession. The recent appointment of the judge in the Consistory court is a striking example of the excellent judgment which regulates the choice of judges to those courts. This also affords me an answer to another observation of my learned friend, respecting certain other judges in the courts of common law; for the appointment to which I have just alluded shews, that persons who sit on the same side of the House with my learned friend, are sometimes called to fill the highest offices in the courts, and that it does not enter into the contemplation of those who have the appointments at their disposal, to ask what has been the party politics of an individual, but whether he is qualified for the situation in which it is proposed to place him.<lb/>
My learned friend has likewise complained of the constitution of the court of Delegates. The court of Delegates must be considered in the nature of a court of appeal from the other civil courts. The court may probably admit of improvement. On that point I will give no opinion. I only mention it at all lest it may be supposed that I have passed the subject by, without having turned my thoughts to it. Though I do not mean to say that the constitution of the court is perfect, yet, as the civil law has always been subordinate to the common law, I am by no means disposed to consider it a defect, that a common-law judge is joined with the civil-law judges in the court of Delegates. I think, however, that it may be an advantage, if instead of the younger doctors acting as judges in the court of Delegates, the judges from the other
<col>840</col>
civil courts presided there. But the subject is one, which would not, I think, properly come within the labours of the committee, although, if they should think it right to direct their attention to it, and suggest any improvement, there can be no possible objection to their doing so.<lb/>
From the court of Delegates my learned friend has taken a sudden flight to the courts in India, whither I think the House will concur with me in thinking that I need not follow him. My learned friend has strongly urged the advantage which would result from establishing the trial by jury in the native courts more efficiently than it at present exists. I should be sorry if any observations falling from me should have the effect either of retarding that measure, if it would be an improvement, or of pressing it forward, if it would be mischievous. I will therefore observe what I consider to be only a discreet and proper silence. Others better acquainted with the subject will have an opportunity of expressing their opinions upon it, which I am sure will be much more valuable than any suggestions I can offer. My learned friend has brought forward only one case to illustrate this branch of his subject, and I cannot help thinking it was unfortunately selected. He stated that, a jury being brought together for the purpose of trying a man who was charged with murder, eleven of the jury obstinately wished to find him guilty, but were at length turned round to a contrary opinion by the cleverness of the twelfth juror, a young Brahmin. Now, I think this instance is rather an authority against than for the establishment of the institution of trial by jury in India; for they appear to have given the decision the wrong way. I must repeat, however, that I should be sorry to do any thing which would militate against the introduction of so useful a system into India if circumstances should require it.<lb/>
The next thing of which my learned friend has complained, is the manner in which justice is administered in the court of Privy Council. I am not prepared to say that greater expedition may not be employed in the investigation of causes in that court. My learned friend is a little unjust, however, when he is pleased to state that the causes in the Privy Council are decided by persons brought together apparently without any reason, and having very little knowledge of the subject matter under discussion. My hon. and learned
<image src="S2V0018P0I0428"/>
<col>841</col>
friend should recollect that a judge of great experience, from one of the courts of equity is always considered the arbiter of justice in the Privy Council. The Master of the Rolls is always there, if not as a matter of duty, in compliance with custom; and custom so rigidly observed, that I believe the court is seldom considered formed unless he is present. Now, if there be one person like the Master of the Rolls qualified to investigate the matters which come before the court, it matters little whether the individuals associated with him are distinguished by equal ability. It should be recollected, also, that the causes decided in the Privy Council, are not brought suddenly before the court. They come before the judge accompanied with a statement of the previous proceedings in them, with the arguments on each side, and, indeed, every circumstance connected with them. These particulars are lodged with the judge, who, as well as the other members of the council summoned, have time to consider them. With respect to the persons summoned, the rule universally observed is, to bring together those persons who have practised in the different colonies from which the appeals respectively proceeded. For instance, if the appeal were from India, there are summoned, besides the Master of the Rolls, such members of the Privy Council as have exercised functions in the Indian courts. A practice of the like nature is observed with respect to appeals from other colonies. The object is always to bring together as much local information as possible. The counsel employed are always selected from the different municipal courts. There never could be a particular bar to attend that court, because there never would be sufficient business to raise one. If there are counsel on each side from those different courts&#x2014;persons brought together who possess local information on the points under discussion with an eminent judge from a court of equity to decide&#x2014;could there, I would ask, be a more competent tribunal for objects to which it is devoted?<lb/>
My hon. and learned friend began his observations upon a very important branch of our laws, both in my estimation and in the opinion of the community. I allude to the justices of the peace. I must say that my learned friend has not treated this subject with the liberality nor with the justice which it deserves. I do not think a more estimable body of persons exist in
<col>842</col>
this country than the gentlemen in the commission of the peace&#x2014;nor any who perform their duties with more rectitude. Let us see how my learned friend has stated the case. Has he argued it with candour, in a maner that will bear scrutiny, or that is likely to assist his cause with an intelligent assembly? My learned friend has brought forward a few instances which have appeared in the courts of law, in which complaints have been made against magistrates for offences alleged to have been committed by them in the execution of their duty. But he is totally silent upon the steady uniform course of justice administered, from year to year, throughout this vast and populous empire. Does my learned friend know the number of magistrates throughout England and Wales? The number is not less than 4,500; besides those who are occupied in cities and towns corporate. These persons carry on what I may call the every-day domestic administration of this kingdom. I must say, when I consider the number, or look at the variety of causes submitted to the decision of justices of the peace, I cannot sufficiently appreciate the use they are of to the community. Let us consider "Burn's Justice," with its five volumes, the vast variety of cases in settling small disputes, and preventing litigation, and in deciding cases of wages&#x2014;let us consider the complexity of these cases, and the passions excited by them; and can we be surprised, that a case of false judgment is now and then brought against a magistrate in the court of King's-bench? To me it appears wonderful that the cases are so few. The first and most prominent source of these complaints is, the licensing of alehouses. From this duty the magistrates are, I believe, anxious to be relieved. I believe a greater boon could not be conferred upon them, than that of taking this duty out of their hands and putting it in the hands of other persons. It has occurred to me that, instead of allowing of appeal from the petty to the quarter sessions, it would be an improvement to place the power of signing licences at once and exclusively in the quarter-sessions. This is merely a suggestion of my own, which I throw out for the consideration of others; but I think such a measure would remove from the magistracy some of the odium under which they at present labour.<lb/>
My learned friend says, that he does not like that magistrates should be appointed
<image src="S2V0018P0I0429"/>
<col>843</col>
by the lords lieutenant of counties. Who, I would ask, is more proper to appoint them? Somebody must name them. It is impossible they can be drawn by lot out of an urn. Ought the power of appointing magistrates to be in the lord lieutenant, who has a personal knowledge of the greater part of those whom he appoints, or in some other officer of the crown? If the judges of assize were to appoint them, those learned persons must get the necessary information respecting their character from a third party. If the power of appointing were in the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the same objection would apply. Is it not better that the lords lieutenant, who are on the spot, and possess the best means of obtaining personal knowledge of the individuals they may choose to appoint, should on their responsibility exercise that power? My learned friend, however, is particularly nice in his ideas respecting the qualification of magistrates. He says he does not like a clerical magistrate, because his views are not sufficiently enlarged&#x2014;he is not what is called "worldly" enough. Then, again, he considers the squire magistrate too worldly. But when my honourable and learned friend disposes of so large and important a body as the unpaid magistracy, he is bound to provide the country with something else. Would my honourable and learned friend have a paid magistracy? If we had a magistracy of that nature, a magistracy paid by the Crown, would he not avail himself of the occasion it would afford him, of talking of the increasing influence of the prerogative; and would he not sometimes be heard to complain, that the bench of magistrates, like the bench of judges, was seldom accessible to the gentlemen who sat on my learned friend's side of the House. My learned friend does not seem to like either clergy or laity in the commission, nor does it appear whom he does like, or in what manner he is inclined to dispose of the trust. He has, probably with a view to raise a laugh at my expense, alluded to the fact of Cromwell having sat in that House, not for the University but for the town, of Cambridge; but he has not quoted to the House, a speech by the same remarkable individual which seems to bear some resemblance to the state of my learned friend's own mind. Cromwell is known to have declared, that "what he would not like that he could tell; but what he would like that he could not tell." So
<col>844</col>
it seems to be with my learned friend, upon many points connected with the extensive subject of his motion. But that is not enough to prepare the way for legislating on such important matters. There should be something plain and distinct before the House.<lb/>
My hon. and learned friend says, that he does not like the way in which Crown cases are managed, and has urged a variety of objections, with his accustomed ingenuity and eloquence, against various parts of the present practice; but, however plausible they may appear in his statement, they will vanish into empty air upon a fair examination of their merits. It shall be my endeavour to follow my learned friend through every prerogative on which he has touched,&#x2014;to grapple with every objection he has put forward one after another, and I am satisfied to stand or fall by the result. My hon. and learned friend has mentioned a case in illustration of the injustice to which the subject is exposed in suing for property in possession of the Crown by petition of right. He has stated that the only way in which property, once possessed by the Crown, can be obtained is by a legal process, entitled the Petition of Right, but that the officer of the Crown can object to grant the petition of right in the first instance, and by that means defeat the just claim of the subject, without taking the decision of any tribunal on the case. As for the instance selected by my hon. and learned friend in support of this allegation, the House will do well to consider it more maturely. The case was as follows: in the reign of Henry 8th. sir A. Brown, then Master of the Horse, had received an estate which was entailed in his heirs male. In failure of heirs, the estate went back to the Crown&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00602"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> observed, that he had mentioned no names in his statement, and had abstained from doing so for fear of disturbing any existing titles.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00603"><member>The Solicitor-General</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014; I thought my hon. and learned friend had mentioned one name, but as I find myself mistaken, I will follow the example of my hon. and learned friend. In the case of which he has been speaking, the estate went back to the Crown&#x2014;and what did the Crown do upon that occasion? It acted as it always has done in such cases&#x2014;looked out for the person who came nearest to the situation of a claimant, in order to present that person with the estate. Nothing is more common than such proceedings on the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0430"/>
<col>845</col>
part of the Crown. Even in the case of illegitimate children, who have no claim whatever, they are often allowed to inherit when there are no other claimants. Nay, the humane principle is carried so far, that even adopted children had been recognised by the Crown as heirs to the estates which otherwise must have reverted to the Crown. I mention these facts to show, that the property which, in failure of issue, reverts to the Crown, is dealt with in the most benignant manner, and is not appropriated with the avidity which may be supposed from the manner in which the subject has been treated. But, to return to the case in question. In 1797, the property granted in the way described fell to the Crown through the failure of heirs male; however, it seems there was a daughter, and though it was impossible she should claim as an heir male, the Crown made a lease of the forfeited lands to her and her husband, under the Statute of Anne. The property remains in her possession, or that of her descendants; but, in 1815, up starts a person, who says he has a right to claim through the heirs male of the original grantee. Now, supposing him to possess a well-founded claim to the property, it is only for him to proceed by ejectment, in order to turn out the present possessor; but no, says the learned gentleman, who was counsel for the claimant&#x2014;"We will not avail ourselves of this mode of proceeding: we will lay a case before the Attorney-general, and claim the benefit of a writ of right." The party pursued this course, but the Attorney-general, perceiving that the claimant had another remedy, decided that it was not a case for the interposition of the authority vested in him by the Crown, and very properly, as I think, refused to act in the way required, or expend the public money for the advantage of an individual. If the party had a good title&#x2014;and my learned friend asserts there never was a better&#x2014;then it was extremely imprudent on his part to stand upon punctilio, and because a petition of right was refused, to decline proceeding by the ordinary mode of ejectment. I cannot help thinking the party was a better subject for a commission of lunacy than a writ of right pleaded in this manner. It is difficult to imagine why the claimant alluded to, should have given such a decided preference to the petition of right, above the simple process of ejectment; but perhaps it is possible to assign one
<col>846</col>
motive&#x2014;perhaps he found it more convenient to try it on the petition of right, which would leave him no costs to pay in the event of failure, than on the other principle, which must saddle him with costs, if he failed to make good his claim. But, whatever his motive might have been, I will say that the Attorney-general did right in refusing to interpose the prerogative, and that he would have abandoned his duty, if he had permitted the prerogative to be misapplied, and the public money to be wasted, in the litigation of private individuals.<lb/>
The next point adverted to by my hon. and learned friend was the state of the law as it related to the comparative privileges of the Crown and the subject, with respect to demurrers. My hon. and learned friend complained, that a person who demurred to the law was obliged to admit the facts alleged against him, and could not go back from that admission; while no such, restriction was imposed on the Crown. But, in fact, the law does nothing more than place the Crown and the subject in the same position. It is no answer to this statement to say, that the Attorney-general, on the part of the Crown, can demand a trial at bar before the four judges, and that the subject has no right to demand it. The law is such, I allow: but the practice is, that, whenever the subject can make out a case which ought to entitle him to a trial at bar, it shall never be refused him. The right of demanding it was vested in the Crown, upon the presumption that the officer of the Crown will never exercise it, except in such cases as clearly justify its use&#x2014;in such cases as would call upon him to grant it to the subject, if he had the same plea to submit; so that in reality the law in this respect does nothing more than place the Crown and the subject upon equal terms, recollecting all along that the prerogative is employed by a responsible officer. In a late case it is true the Attorney-general withdrew the record, and thus removed the case from the jurisdiction of the court, before the jury could return their verdict. But with respect to that case I have something to say. In the first place it is scarcely necessary for me to explain to the members of this House, what is meant by a nonsuit, though I hope that none of them have ever experienced what it is. They are all aware, that a suitor can withdraw himself from court at any time, in which case he suffers what is
<image src="S2V0018P0I0431"/>
<col>847</col>
called a nonsuit; but the king cannot be nonsuited, for he is always present in the contemplation of law. The power vested in the Attorney-general removes this difficulty from the Crown, and merely places it on the same footing with the subject, in respect to the withdrawing of causes.<lb/>
There is another topic alluded to, upon which I, to a certain extent, agree with my hon. and learned friend. He tells us that the Crown neither pays nor receives costs in actions at law. This, however, I conceive to be a mere matter of fiscal regulation. It may be a question how far it would be right to employ the public money in Crown law proceedings. The House must be aware that in all actions the Crown is only a party where the objects are the recovery or protection of the revenue. But, Sir, it is for us to consider whether it be not the more proper course to prevent the Crown paying the public money in such cases. In my opinion, if the Crown were to pay and receive costs in legal proceedings, it would have to receive in a hundred cases where it paid in one; but it frequently happens that persons proceeded against by government for frauds on the revenue are unable to pay the expenses of those proceedings. But, Sir, notwithstanding this opinion of mine, I feel quite convinced that every hint or suggestion which hon. members may think it right to throw out on the subject will meet with the attention it deserves.<lb/>
I now come to what has been said by my hon. and learned friend as to the power possessed by the Crown of preventing a <i>tales</i> being granted in certain cases. A recent case occurred upon this point, upon which, I hope the House will allow me to trespass upon its attention while I enter upon a few details: and sure I am, that there never was any case in which less injury was inflicted on individuals by an Attorney-general than there was in this. But before I enter into those details, I feel called upon to say a few words upon the general principle of this question; and I maintain that in cases where the Crown finds an improper conviction, it has a right to grant a pardon; it has a right to exercise its brightest prerogative, in extending mercy to persons unlawfully accused, or unfairly condemned. I now come to the special case alluded to by my learned friend. A smuggler was to be prosecuted, and a special jury were appointed to try the case. Now, Sir, I apprehend that upon the decision of important public cases, no man
<col>848</col>
will dispute the propriety of appointing-men of high public character and respectability as the jurors to whom the cases are to be submitted. This is a power alike exercised by the Crown and the parties by whom the Crown proceeds. But does it follow, where a special jury is appointed on the part of the Crown, that if a rainy day, or any other accidental circumstance, should prevent eleven of that jury from attending, the Attorney-general must pray a tales, and the question be decided by a common jury? The object in view in such cases is the investigation of truth&#x2014;an object which must be frustrated if causes are to be hurried on in this manner. I say, Sir, that such a course of proceeding would injure instead of serving the cause of justice. If a special jury be required, in order to obtain an impartial and unprejudiced decision in certain cases, then, I say, that it is right to vest the power of calling for, and waiting for such a jury, in the discretion of some responsible law-officer of the Crown, whose duty it is to prevent the premature introduction of Crown proceedings. Sir, you cannot make a body of laws so perfect that they will, in all cases, proceed equably, without interruption or hindrance&#x2014;you cannot have a system of laws that will work with the precision and effect of a steam-engine&#x2014;all the parts moving together, each without interruption to the others. The affairs of men, the business of life, is much too various and complicated to admit of any thing like this; there are too many lets and hindrances to allow the machinery of the laws to act always and under all circumstances in an even and unvariable manner. This I willingly admit: the defect is inseparable, from the existing state and constitution of society. It is impossible to have a perfect system of law, so perfect as never to admit of change, never to require alteration. I now come to the particular case in question, which has been alluded to by my hon. and learned friend. He designated it as a case of great cruelty and injustice, and endeavoured to throw the blame of the transaction upon the exercise of the royal prerogative by the law-officers of the Crown, who, on the occasion in question, refused to pray a <i>tales.</i> It appears that a person of the name of Law was prosecuted with four smugglers in the court of Exchequer. Mead was one of the witnesses against him, but on the second trial the smugglers escaped.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0432"/>
<col>849</col>
Immediately upon that event, eighteen indictments for perjury were commenced against the witnesses. Mead was convicted on the first trial; after which the second was called on. What I am prepared to contend for is, that if the Attorney-general knew, as he did know, that the defendants had been taken by surprise, that statements had been made which could be clearly disproved, and that the verdict already given could and would be set aside as soon as the facts were made known;&#x2014;if that was the case, I am prepared to contend that the Attorney-general was right in not allowing seventeen more victims to be sacrificed to public clamour and artful litigation. The truth is precisely so. The Attorney-general was aware that there were new facts to be adduced, and abundant evidence to be brought forward, which could not fail to establish the innocence of the defendants, and therefore he refused a <i>tales.</i> But what followed? No sooner had the court met again, than the verdict was set aside with costs&#x2014;with large and liberal costs. My hon. and learned friend has said, that after great expense, the man, Law, was ruined. But what is the fact? The fact is, that the witnesses were all ringing the changes against those who were prosecuted for perjury. They had the same story to go through, the same statements to make against all, so that of course when the first was acquitted, he was acquitted with full costs. The costs were first laid at 2,000<i>l.</i> They were subsequently reduced, by the master, to 350<i>l.</i>, but eventually they were raised to 600<i>l.</i>, with a power to refer back to the master again if the party complained of the amount. The costs were never complained of; at least the party never went back to the master. In short, after a full review of the circumstances, it is impossible that any man can come to any other conclusion, than that the public officer did his duty. But my hon. and learned friend has told them that this was not all. He has told us that a song was sung, and that Mead having shot at his opponent, killed him on the spot, for which he was only found guilty of man-slaughter. If it is intended to be insinuated that Mead was guilty of murder, all I shall say is, that no murder was ever committed with less premeditation. The circumstances were simply these:&#x2014;The men who had been witnesses against the smugglers returned home to a village near Scarborough, where
<col>850</col>
they were treated with great indignity by Law and his friends. One of the men was beaten violently, and threatened to be thrown into the sea. Mead was also threatened with similar or worse treatment. On the same fatal night, the same mob proceeded to the house of Mead: it was two o'clock in the morning when they arrived there. They did not confine themselves to singing the irritating song: they clamoured, and threatened Mead. Law himself mounted on horseback, encouraging and joining in their tumultuous proceedings. At that moment, terrified for his safety, in the confusion of the scene, a shot was fired by Mead which killed Law. I am borne out in this account of the occurrence by the charge of Mr. Justice Holroyd, who presided at the trial of Mead, and who is known to be a judge of as great humanity, patience, moderation, and discernment, as ever sat on the bench. That learned judge said in his charge to the jury, that the prisoner had acted on the belief that he expected violence before he fired the shot; that the mere singing of the galling song was not the provocation upon which he had acted, but the violence of the deceased and his party at such an hour, before the door of the prisoner, coupled with their conduct and threats on the day before, had put him in fear of his life, and thus palliated the fatal act. After such a statement from the learned judge, I am warranted in saying, that I am borne out in the assertion, that my hon. and learned friend need not have felt so much surprise at finding the charge of murder terminate in a verdict of manslaughter.<lb/>
I have now, Sir, stated the grounds of disagreement&#x2014;if I may use such a word&#x2014;between my hon. and learned friend and myself, upon certain points connected with his motion. They are not wide, nor of a very grave or serious nature. I have stated my opinions; but I do not set up my judgment against my learned friend's experience and information. I am sure that I, in common with the whole House, must feel indebted to my learned friend for the valuable hints which he has thrown out upon this important subject. I must, however, state one word as to my learned friend's objects in appointing this commission; and I think that the whole of his observations reduce themselves to this&#x2014;that it is advisable to have cheap law, or, in other words, that we are bound to make it
<image src="S2V0018P0I0433"/>
<col>851</col>
as cheap as we can. Sir, I agree in this as a general principle. I should like to cut off as much as possible the extraneous forms and intricate labyrinths of legislation; but I do fear that too much is expected from the commission upon these points. It is impossible not to perceive that law may be made much more accessible to the bulk of society than it is at present. But if you wish to keep the administration of the law respectable&#x2014;if you wish to have it revered throughout the country, as it now is in the persons of your judges&#x2014;you never can have it so cheap as it is in France, where a single justice of peace presides in most cases. If you mean to carry on your assize business as it is at present conducted, attorneys must be employed, witnesses must be brought forward and supported; in some cases for a considerable time, and in all cases at a heavy expense. These forms of our legal proceedings will, I hope, remain unaltered. I trust that we shall have, upon the whole, a considerable saving of expense in our legal proceedings; but I repeat, that I fear that that saving will not equal the expectations of many who support the motion for the commission. The commerce and establishments of this country are of such a nature, that our laws must necessarily be of a complicated nature. A simple code of laws would answer well for a simple state of society, but if you wish to make your laws beforehand&#x2014;if you wish that they should have a perpetual operation, then, I say, they must of necessity be of an intricate and complicated nature. Why, Sir, we have at this moment more law in a single Turnpike-bill than would be sufficient to govern an Indian territory under any of its ancient dynasties. And why is this? It is because we wish to leave as little as possible to the discretion of our judges. Our laws are declared beforehand; and if society is so complicated that its interests cannot be provided for but by an extensive body of laws, there must be a class of men accustomed to explain them. Such a class is, under these circumstances, actually necessary for the benefit of the people, in order that the great body of them may not be distracted from their labours by considering the nature and operations of those laws which the complicated state of society has produced. The evils complained of are therefore rather the result of the accidental circumstances of the times, than of the laws themselves.
<col>852</col>
Now, Sir, I ask, whether you think it possible to get men of talent, of education, and of honour&#x2014;a body of gentlemen who will undertake the task of making themselves acquainted with this body of laws&#x2014;unless they see almost a certainty of acquiring a fortune by their labours? The expense of administering the law is, I am prepared to contend, not so much the fault of the law itself, as of the complicated state of society; and therefore, until you can get rid of that cause, and until you reduce society to such a state that every man may be his own lawyer, you cannot cheapen its administration beyond a certain point. I do not say that I do not wish law to be made cheaper, but that I think there is a minimum of cheapness, beyond which you will rind it impossible to go. But, Sir, I am prepared to say that cheapness is not all that ought to be taken into consideration. The angry passions which the law excites, the tearing witnesses and jurymen, and attornies, from their homes and avocations, and the placing them in scenes of riot and temptation, all combine to make the law a greater evil than the expense makes it. Indeed, law may be had too cheap, and then it becomes an unmitigated evil. If law were so cheap as to cost nothing&#x2014;if it were possible to suppose that society could exist under a state of things which would give law cost-free to every man who applied for it&#x2014;if by some strange miracle the finance committee were to find our revenue in such a flourishing condition as to justify it in recommending that the expense of suits should in future be defrayed out of it, the country would be in such a situation, that it would not be worth living in. The hand of one man would be perpetually raised against the hand of another; no fancied grievance would be allowed to sink into oblivion; no petty assault would be either forgiven or forgotten; and the courts would be occupied with the endless quarrels of the peevish and the discontented. It therefore operates as a wholesome check on the spirit of litigation, that there should be in law a dearness commensurate with the exigency which requires an appeal to it&#x2014;a dearness, which, when it does not check individuals in the pursuit of a real right, or impede them in gaining satisfaction for an injury inflicted, is much more beneficial to society than a cheapness which places it within the reach of every vindictive and malicious spirit.<lb/>

<col>853</col>
I come now, Sir, with a greater degree of satisfaction to that part of my observations, in which I shall have to explain the points where I think the proposed commission may be useful. I think, then, Sir, that in many points of pleading and practice it may be very useful. I will begin first with the subject of pleading. I think that my hon. and learned friend, after his humorous description of the evils of special pleading, proposed something which was very like a return to a practice in the law from which we have not been many years relieved. Until the time of lord Mansfield, a general form of declaration was not allowed to be used, as <i>indebitatus assumpsit.</i> Lord Holt had seen the utility of it, but had said that he would be a bold man who ventured to employ it. Lord Mansfield, however, adopted it, and by his authority brought it into general practice. What is the objection to it? My hon. and learned friend said, that there were seven causes of action concealed under it, and had asked with great simplicity, how was a defendant to know which of them was to be employed against him. Now, in reply to this objection, I will tell my learned friend, that though there undoubtedly are seven causes of action included under this form of declaration the parties to the suit must necessarily know what they had to do with each other. For instance, if <i>indebitatus assumpsit</i> were brought to recover the amount of the fees of an office which a person had unjustly usurped, could that person have any doubt, when he saw the declaration, as to what was the cause of the action brought against him? I put it to my hon. and learned friend, whether, on any of the numerous occasions in which he must have been engaged for defendants in actions of <i>assumpsit</i> at the assizes, any attorney has ever suggested to him, "We are in a lamentable situation&#x2014;we do not know why we are dragged here&#x2014;we have no suspicion of the cause of action against us? I am inclined to think that my learned friend has never had any such suggestion made to him; for sure I am that if it had been made to him, my learned friend would have laughed in the attorney's face; so certain is it that the previous dealings between the parties must have made the defendant aware of the nature of the action brought against him. Mark the importance, by the way, of using this general form of declaration. It saves you, in all probability, from a nonsuit. If you were to state at full length
<col>854</col>
all your ground of action, skilful must be that navigator who could steer your bark through all the quicksands of the law, and prevent its striking against the rock of nonsuit. My hon. and learned friend, however, seemed to have forgotten that even though the declaration were to tell him nothing, there is an easy process by which he can obtain a bill of particulars of the plaintiff's demand. The very moment he thinks proper to go to a judge's chambers, he obtains at once, and as a matter of course, all the necessary information which he desires; and yet, for the alleged want of this information, my learned friend would deprive the suitor of the benefit of the general form of declaration which lord Mansfield recommended, and would lead the profession back to the time when such a process of pleading was not permitted to it.<lb/>
My learned friend next stated the objections to which he thought the sweeping plea of the general issue was liable. I agree with my learned friend in thinking, that nothing could be more expedient to the ends of justice, than that a defendant should put upon the record the particular defence which he intends to set up on the day of trial, in order that both parties may be prepared with evidence to decide the question at issue between them, and may be enabled to sift the credit of their respective witnesses. Such a mode of proceeding, amongst its other advantages, would tend to diminish the costliness of law, by rendering it unnecessary to take down to the assizes the multitude of witnesses, whom it was often necessary to have there in readiness to rebut any defence which may be unexpectedly set up by the adverse party, and thus the object of cheapness would be certainly and satisfactorily obtained.<lb/>
I will not carry the House through all the details of my learned friend's speech, as it would be a useless waste of their time and patience to mention the different points on which I have the happiness to agree with him. I will, therefore, frankly admit, without descending to particulars, that my hon. and learned friend appears to me upon points of practice, to have made several very useful and valuable suggestions. Nothing could be more expedient, nothing more useful, than that the committee should inquire into the powers which the different courts possess for executing their ultimate process. Nothing can, in my opi-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0435"/>
<col>855</col>
nion, be more absurd than that money should not be taken as well as goods in execution&#x2014;nothing more inconsistent than that stock should be held sacred from the touch of a <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> judgment creditor. Without pursuing the course of the details into which my hon. and learned friend has gone&#x2014;details which certainly are most interesting in themselves&#x2014;I must say that there can be nothing more proper than that an execution fairly issued should be carried into full effect; at least so far as regards the personal property of the debtor. Whether an execution should be in the same manner awarded and enforced against his land, further than it is now levied under a writ of <i>elegit</i> is a question of a most grave and important nature, and I will not prejudice it by expressing any opinion beforehand. After due consideration has been given to it in the committee (and I think it does require the most serious consideration), that question will be well attended to, upon the suggestion of the committee coming before the House.<lb/>
With respect to one or two other propositions of my hon. and learned friend, I am happy to be able to express my concurrence with them. In the first place, as to the advantage which the administration of justice would gain by the addition of another judge to the court of King'sbench, I agree with him that it might be extremely useful; and I have no doubt that the suggestion will be attended to in the proper quarter, and that an additional judge will be appointed. The object of withdrawing the common motions from the course of the business of the court will then be attained; but as it has been properly proposed, that this additional judge should not be inferior in rank or dignity to his brethren, he will of course, sit as one of the court, either week by week, or term by term, as may be found most convenient, in order to carry into full effect the remedy against the loss of time which the common motions now occasion the more important business of the court.<lb/>
I agree also with my hon. and learned friend in thinking, that it would be a desirable thing to throw open the court of Exchequer. It has, in reality a concurrent jurisdiction with the other courts; and when a bar has been formed there&#x2014;and until a bar has been formed, the alteration will produce but little benefit&#x2014;I see no reason why the legal business of the coun-
<col>856</col>
try should not flow in as free a channel in that court as in any other at the present moment. By this means, too, another court of Equity will be formed, which may relieve the business of the court of Chancery, whether by sending cases of a particular description thither, or by permitting the lord Chancellor to order those cases to be discussed there, as he now sends them to the Rolls court, or to that of the Vice-chancellor.<lb/>
I am ready also to relieve my hon. and learned friend from the difficulty which he feels with regard to the shortness of the vacation, and the inconvenience of the present system of the two moveable terms; as it seems to me, that without any inconvenience, the now moveable terms of Easter and Trinity may be fixed, so that the professors of the law may know when their annual labours will cease, and when they may expect to be restored to their friends and their home. My learned friend mentioned the 10th of April, a day which I am afraid will not be found entirely convenient; for such arrangements must be made as will enable the learned judges, who have gone either on the long circuits (the Northern or the Western for instance) to return to town before the commencement of the term, as they must all sit in court at the beginning of the term, in order to open the court with a proper degree of solemnity. The object, therefore, will be to fix a day as early as possible, subject only to the necessity of securing the presence of all those whose duty it is to administer justice in the court.<lb/>
I agree also with my learned friend, that the inquiries of the commission may be well extended to the subject of the Welsh judicature. The members of the commission will find out what appear to them to be the most wholesome and proper regulations that can be made, and we can afterwards adopt their suggestions, or not, as further consideration may shew us to be expedient.<lb/>
There is one other point on which I wish to say a few words, and that is with regard to the remuneration which the judges are to receive. My learned friend proposes that they should be remunerated by fees. I must say, Sir, that that proposition does not meet my views, nor do I think it at all consistent with the dignity which the judges ought always to preserve. We have but just got out of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0436"/>
<col>857</col>
that system of remuneration; and I certainly can see no reason why we should return to it. It is said that such a mode of payment would tend to make them get through more business, but that is one reason why I cannot consent to it; for, among other objections, I think it is not the least, that the people who had causes in court, might be led to imagine that the judges had an over hastiness in getting on with causes, and some plaintiffs might therefore be induced to choose particular courts where they thought their cases would be more rapidly disposed of than in the others. I think it, Sir, a more dignified and proper course that they should receive a fired and stable remuneration, than that they should receive payment by the means of fees. I the more wonder at this proposition on the part of my hon. and learned friend, as, in another portion of his speech, he expressed his dissatisfaction that the judges of the Admiralty court should be so paid. If, Sir, it is right that the judges of one court should not be remunerated by fees, I think it equally right that those of another should be prevented from receiving payment for their services in that manner; and I am, therefore, consistent with myself, when I declare, that agreeing as I do with my hon. and learned friend, that the judges of the Admiralty court ought not to receive fees, I also maintain that the judges of the Common Law courts ought not to receive them. I think that neither the one nor the other ought to be paid in that manner.<lb/>
Sir, I have not yet mentioned the Court of Common Pleas. With respect to what has been suggested as to the opening of that court, I beg to say, that so far as my individual judgment goes, that court should be permitted to remain as it is at present. I say so, because, in the first place, that court is already open out of Term time, and any counsel may appear there and plead for either plaintiff or defendant; a fact well known to all the profession; and to no man better than to my learned friend, who has often practised there. In Term time that court sits with the same regularity as any other; it is occupied as many hours of the day, and gets through the same business, as the other courts. If, therefore, it has full employment in Term time, and its bar is open out of Term, I see no particular reason that calls on us for an immediate decision on the proposal for an alteration with regard to it. There is,
<col>858</col>
however, another reason, which I think will almost convince even my learned friend that the alteration he has proposed is not expedient. The establishment of the Serjeants is an extremely useful practice for the bar. Every one knows that there are many gentlemen who, from their situation in the profession, are not able to receive that rank which depends on a gift from his majesty (the number of whose legal servants may at that moment be full); and it is, therefore, useful that such individuals may, at their own request (and it is never any thing more than a request that is necessary), be permitted to acquire that pre-audience in the courts, and that rank on the circuits, which the gift of the Crown alone, in other respects, can confer. The institution in that respect is, therefore, useful; and it is not to be supposed that men will go to the expense of taking on themselves the degree of the coif, if they are not certain of obtaining its emoluments. I have, however, another reason for my objection to this part of my learned friend's proposition, which I conceive to be without an answer; and that is the remark I have already made, that open whatever court you may, you will not draw business into it until you get a bar there properly constituted. This has been the great difficulty of the court of Chancery, where, in consequence of there being two courts of concurrent jurisdiction sitting at the same time, and no particular bar formed for each court, the business of both is frequently interrupted. This too, I understand, to be the great fault of the courts in Ireland, where the barristers of each of the Four Courts being able to practise in all, and none of those courts having a bar confined to practise there alone, it has often happened, that when a cause has been called on no barrister has been present; to avoid the evil of which the names of eight or ten barristers may often be seen marked on the back of one brief, in order to ensure the appearance of some one or other of them, when the cause comes before the court. If this be true, and if what I have already stated be correct, I ask why are we to disturb the bar of the court of Common Pleas, since, if the wave of counsel flows and reflows, as circumstances may require, I say that you will take away the certainty of their attendance, without offering any corresponding and commensurate advantage. For these reasons, Sir, I would not disturb the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0437"/>
<col>859</col>
present constitution of the court of Common Pleas.<lb/>
I have not yet said a single syllable on One of the most prominent parts of my learned friend's speech&#x2014;I mean that part of it in which he discussed the question of evidence. I have hitherto abstained from making any observation upon it, because in my opinion it would be a better and a safer course, if we determine to alter the existing law of evidence, to have the alteration made by a separate legislative enactment. It is one of the most important questions that the House can entertain. All the other alterations which my learned friend has proposed apply to what I, speaking comparatively, will venture to call the mere fringes of the law. If we should prove to be wrong in altering the process of the law relating to executions levied upon property, or on any other of the forms regarding the mere administration of the law, we may soon retrace our steps; but the law of evidence is the master-key of the whole; it is a principle running through every part of the law; and any one who proposes to alter it should produce a bill considerately prepared and deliberately matured, containing the exact alterations he wishes to introduce, and should not leave it open to the vague and hasty suggestions of any persons whatever. I observe that this has always been the course pursued with regard to the alteration of other important laws. The statute of Limitations, the statute of Frauds and Perjuries, introduced by sir M. Hale, and the statute of Anne, were all legislative alterations proposed in the manner I have mentioned. This House has many stages to secure the proper consideration of a measure; for instance, the bringing up of the report, and the committee upon it, are intended to offer opportunities for the suggestion of improvements; but, notwithstanding all these advantages, I do think, that with respect to this most important subject, the law of evidence, the course I have mentioned ought to be pursued, rather than the adoption of a wider system.<lb/>
I may now, Sir, be permitted to say, that there are many alterations which, in due time, will be brought forward through the labours of the noble and learned lord at the head of the court in which my hon. and learned friend and myself practise. I believe, that in the course of the session, there will be laid upon our table two bills, which have
<col>860</col>
been prepared under the direction of that noble personage. One of them is intended to prevent any case from being taken out of the statute of limitations except by a declaration in writing&#x2014;to prevent any insolvent from being bound by a subsequent promise, except by a promise in writing&#x2014;to prevent an infant from being bound after he comes of age to provide for any extravagant debts which he may have incurred before, except by a promise in writing, and to take away the absurd distinction which exists in practice, between not making a person responsible for the debt of another except by guarantee in writing, and the making him responsible for any debt which that person has contracted owing to a false representation he might have given of his circumstances. Such an act, I conceive, would effect a very beneficial change in the present state of the law, and would be extremely useful in various other respects. The other bill is intended to obviate the evils arising from the objections, which are so continually taken upon variances. It will give to the suitor the power of alteration up to the last stage of the action on payment of costs, when the alteration is evidently not made with a view to mislead the adversary, and when the objection taken upon the variance is only resorted to for the sake of turning the party round, and of preventing him from obtaining his just demand. Besides these two bills, I know, though I have no authority to name it, that there is now in contemplation a design to pass an act of a healing and quieting nature, which will prevent us from the necessity of going back to the period when king Richard went to the Holy Land, the only period at which a title can be said to be safe&#x2014;which will bring down to a limited and reasonable period the time when the title of individuals can be considered in safety&#x2014;which will perpetuate harmony in those high classes of society, between whom it is so essential that harmony should prevail, and which will tend to fix the rights of property on a more secure basis than any measure which was ever yet proposed to parliament.<lb/>
I believe, Sir, that I have now come to the close of the observations which I have to offer to the House on this important subject. Whether my hon. and learned friend will receive me as a fellow-labourer in the same vineyard with himself, or whether he will consider me to be too luke-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0438"/>
<col>861</col>
warm to afford him any effectual support in the consummation of his plans, it is not for me to say: but if I am thought worthy to be his fellow-labourer, I declare, that though I shall wish to preserve the plant under which our ancestors have slept, and under which we ourselves have flourished so long, I will not be slow to remove the tendrils which have sprung from it, when I am convinced that instead of advancing they retard its growth. If time shall have caused it to send forth superfluous and unnecessary branches, no one will use the pruning knife with more unrelenting severity. At the same time that I say this, I must also say, that I am anxious to transmit to posterity the laws of England, the same in substance as we received them from our ancestors. I would make no alterations in them which I do not in my conscience consider to be rendered necessary by the encroachments of time or the exigencies of the country. I thank you, Sir, for your patient hearing, and sit down with expressing my concurrence in the motion of my hon. and learned friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00604"><member>Mr. George Lamb</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;Sir, the Solicitor-general has complained of my hon. and learned friend, the member for Winchelsea, for having ill-treated the justices of the peace. I must say, that I am surprised to hear him make this accusation; and I am the more surprised, because, from something which fell from an hon. member yesterday, it seems that the same opinion is entertained by others. I do think that there is nothing more improper than to exhibit an excessive soreness of feeling at any attack, when that attack, instead of being made on good men, clearly applies only to the unworthy members of a particular body. But if my hon. and learned friend has ill-treated the magistrates of the country in his attack, they have been equally ill-treated by the learned Solicitor-general in his defence of them. As one of the proofs that my hon. and learned friend's attack was improper, he has stated the number of justices of the peace in the United Kingdom, and the paucity of cases which come from them before the King's Bench. Why, Sir, that is the very case which my hon. and learned friend makes against them. But few appeals come from their jurisdiction before that court, in consequence of the difficulties thrown in the way of bringing them there. In saying this I do not undervalue the services of men who render justice to
<col>862</col>
their fellow subjects cheaply, and, I believe, honestly and conscientiously. I do not agree with the objection made to the mode of their appointment, because I do not think the lord chancellor, or the Secretary of State for the Home Department, among their other numerous avocations, would be able to obtain such a local knowledge of the gentlemen of the distant counties in England, as would enable them to exercise the power of appointment with a sound discretion. Nor do I think it right to consider that the interference of the chancellor has never been more than merely nominal; for I know several cases in which he has interfered; certainly not to strike out the name of any gentleman recommended by the lord lieutenant or actually in the commission of the peace, but to supply the omissions of the proper officer.<lb/>
With regard to the licensing system, that is a very different thing; and I fully agree with my hon. and learned friend, that that system should be altered. I should have felt this a difficult question to deal with, but the learned Solicitor-general has taken away the difficulties by stating, that the magistrates are anxious to give up their power over it. God be praised for this declaration [cheers]&#x0021; I trust a bill will soon be introduced upon this subject. I recollect there was once a bill, requiring the magistrates to give a reason for refusing to grant a licence; and I recollect too on the debate there appeared such great unwillingness on the part of the magistrates to give reasons, like Falstaff, on compulsion, that it caused a fair inference, that they never did or could give reasons from any lesser motive [hear, hear&#x0021; and a laugh]. It is clear, therefore, that the present system requires some alteration. The Game-laws are another objectionable part of the jurisdiction of the magistrates, and I hope to see them amended. But if they are, I still fear a fondness for game will bias the opinions of the magistrates at the quarter-sessions. It is not merely when a poacher with game actually in his possession is brought before them, that they act with severity; but when a felon, against whom only a whisper is circulated on a bench that he is a poacher; and it is seldom that the highest punishment which the law allows is not inflicted for his crime. I agree, therefore, with the present mode of nomination; and whatever other objection may be made, I
<image src="S2V0018P0I0439"/>
<col>863</col>
confess, that at present I know no better mode of bringing justice home to the very doors of the people than the present; but my objection is to the local prejudice which must bias the mind of the magistrate, as to every offence committed in his neighbourhood. It is remarkable, Sir, that our laws, which took such especial care to prevent the influence of this local prejudice, that in appointing itinerant justices who were to have no connection with the counties where they administered justice, and in preventing (till very lately) those justices from trying cases in the counties in which they were born;&#x2014;I say it is remarkable, Sir, that these same laws, contemplating a set of justices connected most intimately with the counties in which they were magistrates, should have fortified them in every manner against every remedy that might be attempted to be enforced against them, in matters of either a civil or criminal nature.<lb/>
My hon. and learned friend has pointed out the difficulties of pursuing magistrates criminally; nor are those difficulties less in attempting to enforce a civil remedy against them. The statutory difficulties which a plaintiff has to contend with in such case, are very great. He must give a notice within one calendar month; he must bring his action within three months; that action must be tried in the same county in which the justice resides; the justice has the opportunity of tendering amends; and if he does tender them, and the jury should afterwards think them sufficient, the plaintiff must pay double costs, while, if he fails in stating that the act of which he complains was done wilfully or maliciously, he can only recover two-pence above the costs to which he has been put. In many cases these rules are very severe in their operation. I recollect too, when I was at the bar, there was a rule which I believe is still law, that any outstanding conviction at the quarter-sessions was a bar to a civil action. Now, if we consider the difficulties which many statutes throw in the way of a man who seeks to quash a conviction&#x2014;if we recollect the immediate notice he is compelled to give&#x2014;the security he must enter into for the prosecution of his suit, and for the payment of costs in case of defeat, it must frequently happen, that an ignorant person convicted before a magistrate, may, though innocent, lose his power of appeal, and be instantly barred from all chance of re-
<col>864</col>
ceiving compensation for any injury done to him. I do not wish to see any other alteration, than that magistrates should be made responsible as other officers, are, for what they do. Where they act wilfully and maliciously, they should be responsible criminally; and where they act through mere mistake, but their error creates a civil injury, they should be responsible in damages, without proof that the act was either wilful or malicious. I think that county magistrates ought to be brought to that state in which Fielding recommends all magistrates' clerks to be. When 'squire Western was going to commit the chambermaid to Bridewell, for calling his sister "an ugly old cat," luckily, says Fielding, "the justice's clerk had a qualification, which no justice's clerk should be without, namely, a little knowledge of the law;" and he, therefore, warned his master that he could not commit to Bridewell merely for ill breeding. It is remarkable that Fielding did not venture to recommend this to the county magistrate himself, that he considered quite out of the question. Therefore, I am glad to observe that the march of intellect has since that time not been at a stand-still among county magistrates; for I know several who have not merely some, but a great, understanding in the laws of the realm.<lb/>
On the whole, then, Sir, I merely wish that magistrates should be taught to consider this knowledge as indispensable, and to administer so as to execute justice, and not justiceship, which, as Fielding also observes, is indeed a syllable more than, justice.<lb/>
I feel alarmed, Sir, at saying any thing upon the subject of special pleading in the presence of so learned a special pleader as the Solicitor-general&#x2014;though, by the way, he was my junior when I was at the bar&#x2014;but I do not approach the subject with the awe of my hon. and learned friend&#x2014;an awe which reminds me of the schoolmaster who would never teach any son more than his father knew. We are not informed how he ascertained the quantum of information possessed by the father; probably to save his own trouble he assumed it to be the smallest possible quantity. Certainly this will not much contribute to the increase of knowledge. The march of intellect would be rather retrograding if any such "school-master were abroad." But how much did it tend to produce due sub-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0440"/>
<col>865</col>
ordination in families and such a rule would also have tended to prevent my learned friend from vilifying the science he had imbibed from the learned solicitor to the face of the legal parent who begot him [laughter]. When I was first called to the bar, I know that that rhetoric, or perhaps I should say logic, of the bar&#x2014;special pleading&#x2014;was very much praised; but I had not long been a member of the profession before I set it down as the creator of delay, and expense, and mystification [hear]. I do not think there is any thing more useless&#x2014;not even the professorship of Casuistry still retained at our Univerities&#x2014;than what is called the logic of special pleading. What is said in defence of it? The action of <i>indebitatus assumpsit</i> is acknowledged to be a world of rigmarole; but it is said, that the parties know the question in the cause, and it is therefore defended. But I ask, if the parties really have this knowledge, where is the necessity for stating in a number of different ways the same cause of action at so much length, and with so much affected nicety? I am warranted in what I say, by my learned friend's acknowledgment of the total uselessness of the <i>indebitatus assumpsit.</i> In stating the guards by which justices are protected against civil actions for misperformance of their duty, I only object to some of the regulations, because appropriated to a particular class of persons. I perfectly agree that the tender of amends might be of greater advantage if it were made general; and there seems no reason why it should not be made to apply to actions, <i>ex delicto,</i> as in the case of justices.<lb/>
As to the question of arrest on <i>mesne process,</i> where a debt has been contracted without imputation of fraud, I am of opinion that there ought to be no remedy at all against the person; but in proportion as the remedy against the person is weakened, I would strengthen the remedy against the property. The honest trader ought to know when to give credit on the foundation of property; and on no other foundation ought he ever, in my judgment, to give credit; and if he proceeds with due caution he will generally be secure.<lb/>
My learned friend opposite touched but lightly on the question of evidence; he thinks it ought not to be made part of the consideration by the commission, which I am happy to hear is to be appointed;
<col>866</col>
but if he had attended to the speech of my hon. friend below me, he would have found that the bills which the noble lord at the head of the court of King's-bench is preparing, do not apply to many of the points urged. My hon. friend below made some observations on the propriety of admitting parties as witnesses; and if they were to be liable to be produced on <i>subp&#x0153;na,</i> and compelled to give their testimony&#x2014;such a proposition, I own, would stagger me. I, however, see no reason, why parties should not come into court to tell their own story and to be subjected to cross-examination. But whether or not admitted in this way my hon. and learned friend's objection still remains&#x2014;that the practice in this respect is not uniform. Hudibras may here be quoted as a high authority in point:&#x2014;
<quote>"Does not in Chancery every man swear</quote>
<quote>"What makes best for him in his answer?"</quote>
And why is the practice to be confined to that court? There he gives his own story upon paper, and why is he not to tell it <i>viva voce</i> in a court of Common Law? No man can dispute, that the decisions of the law, in many instances, are extremely absurd. What can be more absurd than what takes place with regard to releases? A witness is called who has an interest, and a release is handed to him in order to enable him to give his evidence. What is the inference? Either that he knows the release will be restored and cancelled the moment he steps down from the box, or that the interest on his part is so small, that it could produce no influence on his mind.<lb/>
I will not now touch upon the propriety of admitting the affirmations of Quakers on their own behalf, because I think I see some objections to it, founded upon the prejudices peculiar to that sect; but I wish to come to a point which I have long considered, and which I had meant to bring before the House as a separate measure, but it may be very convenient to state it now. And here I may remark, that I do not quite concur with my learned friend below me, for he said, that he did not wish to do away with the necessity of having two witnesses in cases of perjury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00605"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> interposed. His hon. and learned friend was mistaken; he had contended the very reverse. He had objected to all that are called presumptions in construing and weighing evidence, and he had maintained that as one. It was a rule of evidence, that an accomplice was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0441"/>
<col>867</col>
not to be believed unless confirmed; and where there was oath against oath, a second witness, or something that might amount to a distinct and irrefragable corroboration was required. He thought, that in cases of perjury there ought to be something to turn the balance. The rule at present was too inflexible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00606"><member>Mr. G. Lamb</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;I am happy to find that I do not differ from my hon. and learned friend, as much as I expected. The difficulty of convicting in cases of perjury is one of the great blots in the law, both civil and criminal. Perhaps this topic is not so naturally connected with the common law as with the criminal law. Every one at all connected with criminal proceedings, must have constantly seen perjured <i>alibis</i> set up, and not always unsuccessful; but whether successful or not, no one of the abandoned characters, who thus give their testimony, is ever brought to punishment. Looking at the rule of law which requires two witnesses to convict a man of perjury; the reason, and the only reason (which sounds plausible and unanswerable at first) for it is, that an oath having been taken on one side, there ought to be two on the other, in order to give the preponderance. If this be a correct rule, why is it not applied to other cases? Suppose one witness swears a robbery against a prisoner at the bar&#x2014;that prisoner establishes an <i>alibi,</i> or otherwise disproves the charge by fifty witnesses, yet not only does the judge not, as in the case of perjury, stop the prosecution on account of the two contradicting witnesses, but the jury nine times out of ten convict the man upon the single oath. I believe I am right in stating that there is no rule in law against convicting a man on the unconfirmed evidence of an accomplice. Within the last ten years, if my memory serves me, a conviction of the kind has taken place, which was upheld by a superior court. This is vast in the rule, for an innocent man may be forced by circumstances, or deluded into the commission of a robbery: he may impeach his accomplices, and come into court as a witness, as much entitled to credit as if he had never committed the crime. I have taxed my ingenuity to find out any sufficient reason for this rule in cases of perjury. Lawyers are so fond of it, that they have endeavoured, on this ground, to account for a similar rule in cases of treason. They say, that two witnesses are there necessary, because, as every subject has
<col>868</col>
taken, or is supposed to have taken, the oath of allegiance, that is one oath which it is necessary to oppose by two others, in order to produce a preponderance. It reminds me of an instance of a special pleader, a member of a very learned and pains-taking branch of our profession, who, in an action for an assault, framed the declaration as for a breach of contract: he reasoned thus:&#x2014;Every man is bound by a tacit obligation to keep the peace towards the rest of the king's subjects. The assault was, therefore, a breach of the obligation, and the party assaulting was then liable to be sued by <i>indebitatus assumpsit.</i> I do not mean to call in question the soundness of the rule of two witnesses, in cases of treason; for it stands upon the ground of a wholesome constitutional privilege of the Crown to guard a man from being borne down by the weighty hand of power. But it occurred to me, that in cases of perjury, it might be said that the contradiction of the oath constitutes the crime. This may form a legal distinction, but none as regards the ultimate result. Whether the jury discredit the former oath sworn by the prisoner, or the oaths of the witnesses who testify to his innocence, the immediate consequence is just the same, namely, the conviction of the accused. Suppose the step I suggest to be taken, will it deter persons from giving evidence? For I admit that if such would be the effect, we ought certainly to adhere to the existing practice. But I ask, what honest man going to tell a plain story in a court of justice, will inquire whether he can be contradicted by two witnesses? Whereas to the rogue, who intends to perjure himself, the rule is a guide-post to direct him in the course he must take. He has only to shape his story in such a way that only one witness can be called to contradict him, and he may perjure himself to his heart's content without the slightest risk of punishment. The rule, therefore, is in fact a rule to facilitate perjury, and to perplex the course of justice. It seems almost as absurd as the old practice of the wager of law, or the case of compurgators, which it very much resembles.<lb/>
I was very glad to hear my learned friend, the Solicitor-general, among other changes, recommend the reformation of the Welch judgeships. I have a great respect for the persons who fill those appointments; but, borrowing a metaphor from another profession, we may call them
<image src="S2V0018P0I0442"/>
<col>869</col>
the "Yellow Admirals" of the bar; and I hope soon to see them rated efficient. I hope, that whatever judges are substituted for them, they will be placed upon a footing with the judges of England: and, above all, I hope they will be excluded from seats in this House. It seems to me an anomaly that a judge should have a seat in the House of Commons, while at the same time I admit that it is of great importance that there should be one common-law legal authority, liable to be questioned and to be called upon to give his opinion in the other branch of the legislature. I trust I shall never again see the chief justice of the King's-bench shut out from the House of Lords. It is due to the dignity of his station and to the importance of his functions, and to that practical responsibility which ought always to be kept up. Sancho Panza said on one occasion, that if it rained mitres not one of them would fit his head; but since of late it has rained coronets, which seem to fit all heads, I think three or four in the course of a century to chief justices of the King's-bench, cannot well be grudged.<lb/>
I have now, I believe, but one more remark to make, and but one objection to the reforms, and that relates to the increase of our ponderous Statute-book. I am sorry to see that the old, plain, and intelligible, common-law has been thrust aside, to make way for acts of parliament. Some of the bills of the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Peel) have certainly tended to lessen the evil of which I complain; but there is such a beautiful certainty in the practice of the common-law, that I trust nothing will ever find its way into the Statute-book that can be kept out of it. My hon. friend behind me seems to disagree with me upon this point, and perhaps, if he will not take my opinion, he will not refuse that of no less a man than lord Bacon, who, in his "Proposal for amending the Laws of England," has these expressions:&#x2014;"In all sciences they are the soundest that keep close to particulars; and sure I am there are more doubts that rise upon our Statutes, which are a text law, than upon the common-law, which is no text law."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00607"><member>The Attorney General</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;In the course of the observations which I may make upon this question, I will state on what points I concur with, or differ from, the hon. and learned gentleman who introduced it. In the first place, I agree that
<col>870</col>
a commission ought to issue, but I cannot agree that the commission should have the comprehensive character which he proposes. The hon. and learned gentleman would have it embrace all possible matters of inquiry&#x2014;every title in "Viner's Abridgment" or "Comyn's Digest"&#x2014;all that relates to the constitution of our courts. The principles of the law&#x2014;the administration of the law&#x2014;the practice of the law&#x2014;in short, the law in its totality is to be pressed into this interminable commission. To the constitution of such a body: I cannot consent; but to a commission t with limited objects and intelligible means; I am ready to consent. It is not my intention to travel over the speech of the hon. and learned gentleman, and I have dissected it into its component parts, in order that I may not pass irregularly from one topic to another. He is, as every body knows, a great special pleader, and, therefore, was aware that it is a high legal sin to couple <i>tort</i> and <i>assumpsit,</i> and in his speech I mark no traces of any such confusion. But his subjects are so multitudinous, that if I were to make a distinct speech upon each of them, I should be obliged to weary the House to-night, for as long a period as he delighted it on the former occasion. I beg his attention, and that of the hon. member for Aberdeen (who, I see, is engaged in conversation with an hon. neighbour, doubtless on the I subject of arrest on <i>mesne</i> process, which he is anxious to bring forward, and I will not long prevent him from doing so), to one point in the outset.<lb/>
I admit, with the hon. and learned member, that at present there does exist such a pressure of business in the court of King's-bench, that the judges, who ought to confine their learning and abilities to subjects of comparatively higher importance, are obliged to devote their attention to far inferior matters. I allude to business in chambers and to taking bail. At present the highest and gravest questions of law, such as come before the court on special verdicts and special cases, are argued before and decided by three judges, while the chief justice is sitting at <i>nisi prius.</i> The learned member stated this as a great public grievance, and I allow that, to a certain extent, he is right. The particular mode of relief was also mentioned I by him&#x2014;the appointment of a fifth judge. If the inferior business of the court were I intrusted to a fifth judge, it will, follow
<image src="S2V0018P0I0443"/>
<col>871</col>
that the other judges, including the chief justice, would be able to devote their attention exclusively to the more important branches of their judicial duty. Until lately, no legal question of magnitude was determined in the absence of the chief justice of the King's-bench; but the <i>nisi prius</i> business at Guildhall, which in the time of lord Mansfield was two hundred causes, and in the time of lord Ellenborough four hundred causes, have now swelled to from six hundred to eight hundred causes, so as to render it impossible for lord Tenterden to go through the <i>nisi prius</i> business, and sit in <i>Banco</i> with his brethren, to decide nice points of law on special verdicts and special cases. I beg to say, in concurrence with the hon. and learned gentleman, that this state of things occasions a heavy loss to the science of jurisprudence; and that it is a solecism and a contradiction in the administration of the law, that the most difficult points are determined in the absence of the distinguished individual, who, from his station, may be presumed most competent to decide them. The project has, therefore, been entertained, for appointing a fifth judge for the court of King's-bench. My hon. and learned friend, in the court of Exchequer, a few days ago, did me the favour to state, that there were few points on which we could agree; and I now reply, that from his talents and ingenuity, there are few men with whom I should be more happy to concur; but when he proposes at once the opening of the court of Common Pleas, he must himself be aware that many weighty considerations must be taken into view before such a step can be taken. One of them is this&#x2014;that it is not the lot of all who are at the bar, like myself, to have received favours from the Crown and to hold office under it. I cannot be devoid of sympathy for my brethren who have not been so fortunate, and I am, therefore, unwilling to make the acquisition of rank merely depend upon the pleasure of the Crown. Beyond all doubt, the Crown, if it thinks proper, can exercise its right, and refuse to make a barrister a sergeant, in the same way that it can refuse a silk gown or a patent of precedency; it is equally in point of fact <i>in arbitrio</i> of the Crown; but in point of usage, an individual of a certain standing, reputation, and talents, who wishes to obtain it, is never refused the rank of Serjeant. I cannot consent to deprive the bar of this facility,
<col>872</col>
although I may agree that there are many subjects on which it may be proper to open the court of C&#x00F3;mmon Pleas. The practice of that court might, perhaps, be beneficially assimilated to that of the King's-bench; and on the court of Exchequer I shall make no remark on account of my coincidence in opinion with my hon. and learned friend.<lb/>
Passing to some other points, the hon. and learned member made some observations upon the constitution of the Privy Council, and he made two heads of complaint against the administration of justice in that court. One head of complaint arose out of appeals; and the increase of them has arisen from the increase of our colonial possessions, the increase of our trade, and the increase of our general prosperity. Under the precedency of the Master of the Rolls, it is allowed that no needless delay has occurred; but still an augmentation of the <i>momentum</i> of despatch may be desirable. On the second head of complaint, namely, the sort of individuals who sit in the Privy Council, I am quite at variance with my hon. and learned friend. It has been the immemorial practice&#x2014;(I do not mean that it is as old as the time of Richard 2nd, and I am glad to see that that date, for the extension of human memory, is likely to be cut down a little)&#x2014;that the Master of the Rolls should preside. My hon. and learned friend asserts, that the other members are not lawyers. He must remember when sir W. Grant, lord Stowell, and the Dean of the Arches (who I am glad to say still holds that office, notwithstanding the mistake into which some people have been led), sat together for the decision of appeals. My right hon. friend (sir J. Nicholl) is still almost constantly present; and while the court is so attended, I cannot agree in the objection that has been raised to the want of judicial talent in the Privy Council.<lb/>
From the Privy Council, my hon. and learned friend, with a little confusion of subjects, proceeds at once to justices of the quarter-sessions and licensing magistrates. I will not open this extensive title, although he has gone over the whole of "Burn's Justice," and has complained of the insufficiency and improper conduct of those who are in the commission of the peace. I take the liberty of saying, that, this part of the subject does not belong to us. If it be true that the licensing system is bad, that magistrates are too fond of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0444"/>
<col>873</col>
committing, or are guilty of other malversations, it may be right to bring in a bill or bills to remedy the evil; but those are not subjects to be delegated to a commission. My hon. and learned friend alluded to the practice of the late chancellor lord Eldon. I am sure that my hon. and learned friend is much too good-natured a man to make any remarks calculated to carry an unmerited reflection; and I am sure, also, that the House will be satisfied, that no chancellor ever conducted himself more properly or constitutionally. Lord Eldon was obliged to rely upon the opinion of some one. He I could not know all the persons in all the counties fit to be in the commission of the peace, and very fitly confided in the recommendation of the lord lieutenant, and did not, as the learned member proposed, take the suggestion of the Secretary of State. It has been made a matter of complaint also against lord Eldon, that he never would consent to strike an individual out of the commission; and his reason was, this:&#x2014;Soon after he came into office application was made to him to strike out the name of a magistrate for misconduct: he refused, until he saw a regular record of the conviction, and it afterwards turned out, that the magistrate accused was acquitted, and successfully prosecuted for perjury several of the witnesses against him. His conduct, therefore, in refusing to strike individuals out of the commission was the conduct of a judge and of a man of honour, and highly constitutional. As to the fitness or unfitness of leaving any particular person out of the commission, party might be there said to interfere; especially if the proposition came from a lord lieutenant, to whose <i>arbitrium</i> it seems to me it would be improper to confide the matter. At all events, I am satisfied that the subject does not belong to the commission we are about to appoint.<lb/>
As to the licensing system, I agree with my learned friend in thinking, that the publicans are merely the vassals of the brewers; and if parliament, country gentlemen, or magistrates, would take up that subject separately, with a view to a beneficial change, it might be extremely proper. It is not, however, a question fit for lawyers sitting under a commission; and it would be most heterogeneous, when mixed up with matters on which they could profitably bestow their learned attention.<lb/>
<col>874</col>
My learned friend proposed, at the outset, that the laws relating to real property should be left out of the question, because, by-and-by, these were to be made a subject of separate inquiry: hence he told me that he should pass them over; but his learned friend did not keep faith with himself, and complained of the great intricacy and confusion of trusts, which constituted the most laborious part of the business of the court of Chancery: he would, therefore, abolish trusts altogether; but I will take leave to say, that such a project is impracticable and visionary. Trusts are created by the management of property subject to mortgages, portions, and all the other incidents of property. Necessity has therefore been the origin of trusts, which my learned friend asserts are a breach of the Statute of Uses, but which cannot be done away with, unless you can do away with the necessity that created them.<lb/>
Another part of the scheme of my learned friend would be extremely useful, if it could be carried into execution. He says&#x2014;" I will abolish all contingent remainders&#x2014;all limitations of real property," that is to say, he would compel the owners of estates not to be capricious or arbitrary in the disposal of them. He must be about as clever as the man who invented sleep, to carry such a project into effect, for he must oblige all persons who sit down, or lie down, to make their wills, to speak so clearly and definitely, and to use such unambiguous terms, that courts of Law and Equity would never be puzzled about the meaning of a testator. He cannot intend that a man should not be allowed to limit his estate as he pleases, and to subject it to all the varieties contingent on property. Though I admit that my hon. and learned friend is ingenious to the very extent of ingenuity, yet I think it is beyond the grasp of any project he ever formed, in the wildest dream of his fancy, to make people always use language perfectly intelligible.<lb/>
My hon. and learned friend, in his speech which was so long&#x2014;not that I wished it to be shorter, like the discontented man, in complaining of what he wants, forgets what he has&#x2014;he complained, and I believe the complaint struck many members with great force, of the want of a court of Arbitration, to which people might go previously to their entrance, on a course of litigation, and have what,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0445"/>
<col>875</col>
in technical language, we term an imparlance with each other, where they might shake hands and settle their differences, by going before an arbitrator, and thus save all the expenses of litigation. This court of Arbitrators would hear all differences and adjust them without cost or contest. Why he forgets that this very thing exists at present. He forgets that, by an act of king William's reign, any parties may agree to have a judge and constitute him their arbitrator. This, then, becomes a rule of Westminster-hall, and the arbitrator is placed under the superintendence of the court. This is the very thing my learned friend wants.&#x2014;But perhaps he does not mean a mode of voluntary arbitration; but a court of compulsory arbitration. Perhaps he means that there should be some authority to which any suitor, willing to compromise his rights, should be able to have recourse, in order to compel the defendant, whether he will or not, to submit to arbitration. But, certainly, according to my view of the constitutional spirit and feeling of the inhabitants of this country, they would not endure a tribunal having such tremendous power, with a judge to be named by the Crown. Whatever my learned friend may invent in his fanciful Utopia, the people of England would not suffer the existence of a court of Arbitration, which should have power to say to any party, "You shall come to us: we will strangle and put an end to your litigation, and compel you to submit to our arbitration." Unless I err greatly in my estimation of my countrymen, such a tribunal would be not slightly unpalatable to British feelings.<lb/>
I shall next advert to some other matters, which, as they were treated by my learned friend, carried with them considerable plausibility. He spoke much of a mode to abridge law-suits, of a short-hand style of administering justice which should supersede litigation in the shape in which it is now carried on. I have only two words to say as to his remarks on the abolition of fines and recoveries. The late lord Chancellor, to whom my learned friend has attributed the praise he deserved, was the first who called attention to this subject. He, it was, and not any one who sat before him in Chancery, who directed that money left by will to be laid out in land, should be actually so laid out, without the party being put to the expense of the conveyance and stamps, and afterwards of the fine and
<col>876</col>
recovery in order to obtain the fee-simple. But to save all these expenses, if an individual was in a situation, by fine and recovery to obtain the fee-simple the holder need not go through these forms to satisfy the purchaser against the tenant in tail, but the lord Chancellor will give the money out on petition, without putting him to the trouble and expense of these formalities, I do not deny that some mode of fine and recovery, more compendious and less expensive, might be carried into effect. But I say, that the principle must be maintained, that the estate should not be permitted to go to any other persons than those intended by the testator, and this object can perhaps be attained without the perfect and complete form of fine and recovery, according to the existing mode of varying the remainders. If my learned friend has any adequate substitute to offer, I will not oppose myself to it: but I will not permit the main object to be defeated, by allowing the original gift to go to other persons than those for whom it was intended. If that principle can be preserved, I am not here to resist any plan for cutting down the forms and saving expenses in fines and recoveries.<lb/>
My learned friend will see, by the course of my observations, that I am not disposed to pick out points to cavil at; but that I wish fairly to meet his project, and see in what part of it I can agree with him. Many of his topics are, I think, impracticable, or, if practicable, not connected with the matters which are fit for the proposed commission. The practical question is&#x2014;what ought and what ought not to be submitted to that commission? It is several years since I left the courts of Common Law. I never regretted my absence from them so much as now, when I am wholly abstracted from them. It would have given me often the pleasure of meeting my learned friend whose great talents and eloquence I so much admire, however we may differ as to political measures. In his speech my learned friend paid a well-merited compliment to lord Mansfield, as a consummate scholar and enlightened philosopher, having the largest expanse of mind, which he was yet capable of narrowing to the smallest circle, and in practice pursuing to the minutest consequences. My learned friend will permit me to remind him, that in the person of that learned individual we have one instance of the vicissitudes in the character
<image src="S2V0018P0I0446"/>
<col>877</col>
of the law. It is not forty years since lord Mansfield was praised by Mr. Dunning, Mr. Wallace, and all the eminent common lawyers, as may be seen in the reports of Douglas and Burrows, for entering upon that course which my learned friend now purposes to abolish. Before his day, it was not allowed to bring actions generally for money had and received&#x2014;actions of assumpsit as they are called. Lord Mansfield was eulogised for dropping the technical mode which before prevailed. But it is now the complaint of my learned friend that the plaintiffs demand is not set forth with sufficient clearness in actions of assumpsit; and he wishes to have the form of special pleading restored to what it was forty years ago, when it was more strict and precise. He would compel the pleaders to specify expressly on the face of their pleadings the nature of the action, which lord Mansfield allowed them to state in a more general form. My learned friend does not concur with lord Mansfield. I have made inquiries of my friends in Westminster-hall, and I find they go along with my learned friend, the Solicitor-general, in the opinion which he has given as to the present practice of pleading. The defendant may always know by a judge's bill of particulars, for 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; and this is what my learned friend would have specified in the declaration. I am very much afraid that the suitors would be losers, instead of gainers, by restoring the old mode of pleading. The present mode causes a great saving of paper, time, and expense.<lb/>
I concur with my learned friend, the Solicitor-general, that the consideration of the rules of evidence is not part and parcel of this subject, and that it would be much better settled by this House in a distinct act of legislation, so that we might clearly understand the principles on which it was founded. There is one part of the speech of my learned friend (Mr. Broughham) in which I do not concur: it is that in which he recommended that the real estate should be subject to the payment of simple contract debts. A bill to this effect was introduced some years ago by sir Samuel Romilly, than whom no person had more experience in this branch of the law, but he failed in carrying it through the legislature. I am decidedly of opinion, that an alteration of the law to this effect would involve the most mischievous consequences. A man's estate after his decease would be
<col>878</col>
liable to all kinds of frauds. If every common debt before a man's death became a burthen on his kind like an instrument or a judgment, such inducements would be held out to fraud, that I cannot at all accede to so dangerous a principle.<lb/>
Before I allude to the next point, I must declare it to be one in which I cannot agree, though I admit it is a project extremely ingenious. At present, where a demand exists in the nature of a debt, if the money sued for is paid into Court before the action is tried, there is an end of it. This is a principle of obvious justice. But my learned friend asks&#x2014;"Why not extend this rule?" If an assault, a libel, or any other wrong be done to any man's person or property, and he brings an action where he cannot anticipate what the damages awarded to him may be, as they depend on the <i>arbitrium</i> of the jury, there, also, I would allow the principle of paying a sum into Court which should put an end to the action and exempt him from costs, unless the jury gave more damages. But there is an essential difference in the case of one person who is endeavouring to enforce an obligation by an action, and that of another who is defending his character. In the latter case is a plaintiff to be met by the payment of 20<i>l.</i> or 30<i>l.</i> into Court? The object of a trial for libel is in its final end not to obtain money but the defence of character. So in cases of assaults, the object is to vindicate the respectability and character of the party aggrieved by the action. It is not brought only to recover 5<i>l.</i> of money, but to uphold the reputation of the plaintiff. Ought this object to be defeated by the libeller paying 10<i>l.</i> into Court, and saying, "That is as much as a jury would give you; there is an end to your action?" I am sure my learned friend, on re-consideration, will find this principle totally inapplicable to the cases in that class of actions.<lb/>
In most of the topics advanced by my learned friend, the Solicitor-general, I concur in the main. I concur with him that the commission should confine itself to the practical conduct of an action, and not touch the general principles of the law, but simply matters of a technical nature. Within these limits, and subject to this restraint, I have no objection to the Commission. I assure the House, and particularly my learned friend, that I have bestowed no small degree of labour in dissecting his opinions, and arranging them under
<image src="S2V0018P0I0447"/>
<col>879</col>
different heads. I have not gone through the whole of them, because my learned colleague has stated many points in which I concur, and to which I do not, therefore, advert particularly. I do apprehend that extreme mischief would result from delegating to the Commission the large and indefinite quantity of matter which my learned friend proposes. I would limit their labours to the particular parts which are within the view of my learned colleague. Though I concur with my learned friend in his general design, I differ from him as to eight out of every ten of his propositions. They may all form very fit Subjects of separate and distinct examination, but I object decidedly to their being considered in the manner proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00608"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> observed, that the hon. and learned gentleman, the Solicitor-general, had objected to the general inquiry into the abuses of the law, sought for by the hon. and learned member for Winchelsea, and had proposed to limit the power of the Commission to two objects: first, to the state of the law respecting real property; and secondly, to the progress of an action at law from its inception to its termination. He would confine the few observations he had to make, to the latter of these propositions, which, taken in the enlarged sense in which he thought it ought to be taken, would include every abuse and defect in the proceedings of our common-law courts, from the commencement of an action (including the arrest) up to judgment and execution; and he hoped that no part of the law or of the practice, which obtained in the course of these proceedings, would be withdrawn from the cognizance of the Commissioners. He objected to their being limited to the mere practice of the courts, by which comparatively little good would be done.<lb/>
On one question of great importance, both the hon. and learned gentlemen (the Attorney and Solicitor-generals) had been silent; and, although the former remarked on the circumstance of the hon. and learned mover of this question, and the hon. member for Aberdeen communicating together on the bench opposite to him, and seemed very well aware, that their communication referred to that important subject; yet, from any thing which fell from either of the two learned and hon. gentlemen, he could not collect whether or not it was intended, as he hoped it was intended, that the law as well as the practice of ar-

rest for debt should be submitted to the consideration of the Commissioners. It was a subject of the first importance, and so considered in every country. In most countries, the arrest of the person was not in general permitted before judgment, not even in commercial countries, except on bills of exchange and other negotiable securities. Without giving any opinion on the law of arrest as obtaining in this country, it would be sufficient to say, that great oppression and vexation might, and he believed did often arise out of it. Independently of malicious arrests&#x2014;arrests without cause, and where no debt was due, an arrest might operate most mischievously and oppressively, where there was a debt really due. Let it be remembered that no previous demand on the party was in general required before he was arrested. He might be arrested at an hour or in a place where bail could not be found, and might for a time at least be imprisoned for a debt which he justly owed indeed, but which he had never refused to pay, and which he had always been ready to pay, if it had been demanded of him. It might be right to consider, whether arrest should be permitted in any case, on mesne process, unless a previous demand had been made, or upon affidavit, of the parties intending to abscond, whereby the plaintiff might be in danger of losing his debt. On the other hand, it was to be considered, how far the transactions of the commercial and trading world would be affected by such a provision; and he thought that the commissioners ought to inquire into this point, and take the evidence of merchants and bankers of London, Liverpool, and other great trading and commercial places, as to the operation and effect on their dealings, if such a provision were to be made law.<lb/>
The hon. member said, that one of the greatest impediments to the administration of justice in our common-law courts had been truly pointed out by his hon. and learned friend, who had moved the present question. He meant the inequality of business in the three courts of Common Law, in Westminster-hall, whereby one court was oppressed with business, whilst another had much less, and the third had scarcely any thing to do. He doubted whether the remedies for that evil, which had been suggested, were sufficient. It had been proposed to open the courts of Common Pleas to the bar in general, and that in the Exchequer the number of solicitors should not be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0448"/>
<col>881</col>
limited as at present, and that the practice should be thrown open to that branch of the profession generally. But the learned: Solicitor-general had objected to opening the court of Common Pleas, and amongst other reasons he had given one which; was the very best, if it were well founded; namely, that the court of Common Pleas had now as much business as it could do. But was this really the case, and if so, what what was it owing to? It was well known, that the causes in the King's-bench were in number in a proportion of about three to one to those in the Common Pleas. If the court of Common Pleas could do no more than it does now, and the court of King's-bench could contrive to get through three times the quantity of business which was done in the other court, what sort of men were the judges of the Common Pleas, and what sort of angels were the judges of the King's-bench? All parties, however, seemed to agree, that the barons of the Exchequer might do a good deal more than they do at present. What he had to propose would, he thought, be a short and effectual remedy for the evil complained of. Let the cognizance of Pleas of the Crown be reserved, as at present, to the court of King's-bench, and matters of revenue to the court of Exchequer; and, if necessary, let pleas of land, and questions in general respecting real property, be confined to the court of Common Pleas; but let the three courts be thrown open to suitors in all other cases, and the practice not confined in. any of them to a particular class or description of practitioners. But he would do more&#x2014;at least he would submit it as a matter for consideration, whether it would not be right, that the proceedings in all the cases in which the three courts had common jurisdiction, should originate in an office common to all of them; that the causes should be entered in a common list, and that there should be but one cause-paper in Westminster-hall, from which the causes should be taken in rotation by the different courts. He never could see, that there was either good sense or justice in giving the plaintiff the choice of the court in which he would bring his action. Why should not the defendant have the option as to the court in which the action against him was to be tried? If the plaintiff had his favourite court, his favourite judges, and his favourite counsel, so might the defendant; and he saw no more justice in allowing the plaintiff to originate his action
<col>882</col>
in one court, than there would be in allowing the defendant to remove it into another. He believed, that in no country but this, had the plaintiff any choice as to the court in which he would bring his action; and even in this country, it was not originally intended that he should; for when each court had its own distinct and appropriate jurisdiction it depended not on the choice of the suitor, but on the subject matter of his complaint, in what court it should be heard and determined. He proposed that the three courts should be equal in authority; that no writ of error should lie from one of these courts to the other of them, and that one and the same court, as the Exchequer Chamber, should be the court in which all their proceedings should, in the first instance, be reviewed.<lb/>
He agreed with his hon. and learned friend, the member for Winchelsea, in a great deal, but not in all that he had said on the subject of pleadings. The pleadings were, in many cases, most prolix. In the ancient pleadings there were seldom more than one or two counts, where perhaps a dozen were now used. But unnecessary counts might be struck out, and the party using them made to pay the costs, whenever the courts saw a case which called upon them so to interfere. He could not, however, agree with his hon. and learned friend in respect to the <i>indebitatus</i> count in assumpsit, which he (Mr. F.) considered a great improvement in pleading, and certainly could not be taxed with prolixity. He allowed that pleas, grossly inconsistent, ought not to be permitted to be joined, and the general rule of law was against them, although certain pleas were permitted to be joined, which were open to that objection; for instance, in debt on bond, the general issue and payment. But he could not think that the different modes of pleading payment, such as <i>solvit ante diem, solvit ad diem,</i> and <i>solvit post diem,</i> were so objectionable in practice as had been stated. The plea of <i>solvit ante diem</i> was indeed unnecessary, as the fact might be given in evidence under the plea of <i>solvit ad diem,</i> but the plea of <i>solvit post diem,</i> which was given by statute, was a most useful and necessary plea. If the bond were not paid at the day, the penalty was forfeited, and payment after the day did hot save it. The substance of the defence ought to be, that the bond was paid, and it would be hard to send the defendant to a court of Equity, having paid the bond, although
<image src="S2V0018P0I0449"/>
<col>883</col>
after the day, with interest up to the day of payment. But, unless for the plea of <i>solvit post diem,</i> recourse must be had to a court of Equity to prevent a forfeiture.<lb/>
There was another point in which he was not prepared to agree with his hon. and learned friend&#x2014;that of compelling the parties to shew to each other, in all cases, the written instrument on which they relied. In the case put by his hon. and learned friend, of the receipt, he did not see, that it ought to have been communicated to the opposite party. He did not see why a fraudulent plaintiff should be put into possession of the defendant's case, in order that he might seek for the means of rebutting it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00609"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, the case he had put was that of an executor plaintiff.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00610"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> said, that no doubt made a difference, but he had understood his hon. and learned friend to have laid down the principle generally as applicable to all cases.<lb/>
There was one point more on which he would trouble the House.&#x2014;It referred to the court of the Privy Council, and the observations which the introduction of that topic had led his hon. and learned friend to make respecting the administration of justice in a part of the British empire, in which he (Mr. Fergusson) would always feel a deep interest. In respect to the court of the Privy Council, he was very much disposed to concur in the description which had been given of it by his hon. and learned friend. He had attended there one day, when a case of great magnitude was heard upon appeal. It was one which he, as counsel, had conducted before the Supreme Court at Calcutta, and in which he had succeeded in obtaining the judgment of the court for his client. The interest involved in the decision of the case was not certainly of less amount than 20,000<i>l.</i> per annum; but in place of the array of judicial talent and authority, which one might have expected to have seen on the judgment-seat of the Privy Council, according to the description given of it by the hon. and learned Solicitor-general, he saw no lawyer there except the Master of the Rolls, a most able and efficient judge, as he admitted him to be. The other judges consisted of one who had been an ambassador, and another who had been governor of an Indian settlement, he believed of Madras; but who could not be expected to afford much information,
<col>884</col>
or to give much assistance, in a question of Hindoo, or any other law. He (Mr. Fergusson) said, that he thought the Court of Appeal which had to decide, in the last resort, on the property, rights, and interests, of eighty millions of people, required to be very differently constituted. The business of such a court ought not to be the secondary duty of any judge, as it was of the Master of the Rolls. The court of the Privy Council ought to be composed of the highest judicial characters, assisted by persons conversant in the laws and customs of the country, from which the appeal, in each particular case, came. He trusted that the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Peel), who had always shewn himself ready to correct the abuses, and advance the improvements, of the law, would take this most important question&#x2014;the constitution of the Privy Council, and the mode of administering justice there, into his most serious consideration.<lb/>
Before he sat down, he would say a word or two on the subject of what fell from his hon. and learned friend on certain points connected with the administration of justice in India. He was not prepared with his hon. and learned friend, to go the length of saying, that trial by jury ought to be introduced into the Company's Courts in India.&#x2014;He meant the Country Courts, as distinguished from the courts called the King's Courts. He conceived that, in order to introduce the trial by jury, there ought to be a public&#x2014;a body of independent men, to serve as jurors; whereas, in the provinces of India, he did not know where such a body of men, in the present state of society in that country, was to be found. He feared that, among the natives of India, the verdict of a jury would be the verdict of the judge, who would, in fact, decide the case, freed from all responsibility.<lb/>
His hon. and learned friend had brought before the House, in the course of the former debate, a case of certain claimants who had contested the right to the estate of the Ranee of Ramnad, which had been under appeal for many years, and was still undecided; whilst the estate itself, consisting of a territory of great value, remained in the custody, as it were, of sheriffs' officers. Now, without knowing the circumstances of the case, he thought it might, and probably would, be found, that none of the claimants could give the necessary security to be put into possession, pending
<image src="S2V0018P0I0450"/>
<col>885</col>
the appeal; in which case, as in all other similar cases, the officers of the government were intrusted with the care and management of the property for the benefit of the claimant, who might be found finally entitled to it. This was any thing but an oppressive measure. It was obviously necessary to guard it against spoliation and waste. This case had certainly been unaccountably delayed in its progress to the Privy Council, or in that court itself, if no decision had yet passed upon it. It had been surmised that parties in India might not be apprised of their right to appeal to the king in council.&#x2014;This was not the case. The parties were always apprised of their right to appeal by a Bengal regulation of 1797, subsequently adopted by the other presidencies, on the security for the costs of the appeal being given by the appellant (for this was always required), each party had notice, that he should take the necessary steps for prosecuting and defending respectively the cause before his majesty in council. Two official copies of the whole proceedings were transmitted to the Privy Council, and copies were to be furnished to the parties, who were to pay for them as in other courts. The parties were at no loss, by a reference to Calcutta, to find the channel of transmitting their case home, and of having a decision passed upon it, if they were so inclined. But he believed that the parties often instituted appeals, without having any intention of prosecuting them with effect, merely for the purpose of vexing and harassing their adversaries. However, he thought that every additional facility that could be given, should be afforded to parties prosecuting and defending their rights at such a distance. It was in contemplation, he had heard, that an agent should be appointed by the court of Directors to act for the parties who did not follow up their appeals; but he was afraid, that the acts of such an agent could not bind the rights of parties who had never given their consent to his agency.<lb/>
From what his hon. and learned friend had said, it might be inferred, that the estates and properties of the natives of India were decided upon by young and inexperienced persons&#x2014;by writers, who went out ignorant of the language, as well as of the laws, customs, and usages, of the people to whom they went to administer justice. Now, what was really the case?
<col>886</col>
The persons who went out, as represented by his hon. and learned friend, received no judicial appointment for several years after their arrival in India. Their first appointment, after having been reported qualified for the public service, was that of assistant to a judge or magistrate, by whom cases of small importance might be referred to his assistant. Upon an average it could not be reckoned, that a person would be advanced to the station of judge in less than ten years; to that of Judge of Appeal and Circuit, in less than twenty, or to that of Judge of the Zudder Dewany and Nizamut Adolut, the highest courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction in India, in much less than twenty-five or thirty years of judicial service. The courts of Zudder Dewany and Nizamut Adolut he had known filled by persons of eminent talent, and great judicial experience and knowledge. He would instance Mr. Henry Colebrooke, Mr. Harrington, Mr. Courtenay Smith, and an hon. member of that House, the member for Huntingdon (Mr. Stuart).<lb/>
It might be supposed, from what was said, not by his hon. and learned friend, but by others, that the administration of criminal justice in India was such, that there was no protection for the life of man. Was this any thing like the fact?&#x2014;On the contrary, there was no country where the life of man, was fenced round with more guards than in India. Take, for instance, a case of homicide. There was the inquiry of the Darogah in the first instance, in the nature of a coroner's inquest. These proceedings were in writing, and returned to the magistrate. Before the magistrate, depositions in writing were taken as in England, which were returned to the court of Circuit, before whom the prisoner was tried. That court was composed of either one or more judges of persons of the standing and experience which he had mentioned. There was another most important judicial functionary necessary to the constitution of a court of Circuit. He meant the Moutavie, a Mahomedan law-officer, a person generally of great learning, sagacity, and penetration, who was present during the whole trial, assisted in the proceedings, all of which were in writing, and decided the case by his futwa, subject, however, to the approbation of the judge, who was not bound to carry the judgment into execution in any case, if he considered that the futwa
<image src="S2V0018P0I0451"/>
<col>887</col>
had been given on defective evidence, as contrary to the principles of the Mahomedan law. In such case it was referred by him to the court of Nizamut Adalut, who, on consulting their Mahomedan law officer, decided finally on the case. No judgment by which a prisoner was condemned to death, or perpetual imprisonment, could be carried into execution, without a reference to that high court. Upon the whole, he thought it would be found, that the judicial system, which had been introduced by the English nation into India, was a great improvement on that which prevailed under the former government and that the natives of those countries felt, that their properties and their lives had a security and protection now afforded to them, which had not been known at any antecedent period. He did not think that the judicial system of India was open to that indiscriminate censure which had been passed upon it by persons who could possess little or no knowledge on the subject; but he admitted, that it was a system, in which there were very considerable defects and imperfections, which he believed no persons were more desirous of finding the means of remedying than those in whose hands was placed the administration of the government of that vast and important part of the British empire.<lb/>
The hon. gentleman concluded by saying, that, although by the admission of the law-officers of the Crown, all had not been conceded which his hon. and learned friend, the member for Winchelsea, had required, much had been granted, as much perhaps as could reasonably be expected, and more, he believed, than could have been hoped for at any former period.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00611"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, it had struck him that it would be some advantage to the House, at the present period of the debate, especially after the subject of the administration of law in the colonies and other topics had been introduced, which did not strictly apply to the question before the House&#x2014;if he took that opportunity of explaining to the House the advice that it was the intention of the government to give to the Crown, with respect to the motion which the hon. and learned gentleman had submitted to the House. If he had understood the speech of that hon. and learned gentleman aright, it seemed to be rather an explanation of his general and particular views on the topics concerning
<col>888</col>
which he thought it proper to recommend an alteration, though he had not laid down in what those alterations were to consist. He believed that the motion of the hon. and learned gentleman was, "That an humble Address be presented to his majesty, praying, that he will be graciously pleased to issue a commission for inquiry into the defects, occasioned by time and otherwise, in the laws of the realm of England, as administered in the courts of Common Law, and the remedies which may be expedient for the same." Now, it appeared to him, that it would have been more consistent with the objects of the hon. and learned gentleman, and with the practical results which it was hoped would be derived from the measure, if some limit were laid down as to the extent of the inquiries of the commission. The hon. and learned gentleman had, indeed, himself pointed out some branches of the law which he thought it desirable not to touch upon, because they had already been taken up by others. In the first place, he had given up the courts of equity, because the equity question had been long placed in the hands of an hon. and learned member, and had been so well attended to that it was unnecessary for him to interfere with it. Secondly, he had abandoned the commercial code. That was a very important part of the law of this country, but that branch, the hon. and learned gentleman, in express terms, left out. The third branch which he had cast aside, was the Criminal law of this country. That branch also the hon. and learned gentleman had excluded, and in stating his determination not to interfere with it, he had expressed a hope that it was not his (Mr. Peel's) intention, to abandon that course which, for four years ago, he had taken, for the purpose of ameliorating that portion of the law. Now, he could assure the hon. and learned gentleman, that he had not the least intention to abandon his labours, with respect to the improvement of the Criminal law. He had found, on his re-appointment to the situation which he now held, that during his absence from office, one branch had been prepared&#x2014;he meant that which referred to offences relating to the person; and he could therefore state, that the alterations proposed on this subject would certainly be submitted to parliament in the course of the present session, though he believed that the first steps on the sub-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0452"/>
<col>889</col>
ject would be commenced in the other House of Legislature. The House would probably bear in mind, that it was no very long time ago since he had introduced a bill for the purpose of consolidating the enactments relative to juries, so that now all the former statutes were repealed and embodied in one. He had likewise introduced a bill, for the purpose of bringing all offences against property within one statute, and for embodying the malicious injury of property in another; so that now, in short, the whole law of offences against property was contained in two acts. There still remained, however, two important branches which required to be introduced to the notice of the House, as belonging to the criminal law of the country. One of those branches was the offences against the person, of which the proposed modification was already prepared, and nearly ready to be submitted to parliament; and the other was the law of forgery, which latter was a most important topic, and might therefore probably soon call for the attention of the House. An hon. gentleman had complained of the great increase of the Statute-book; but he thought that if that hon. member would take into consideration the bulk, which was certainly the most important point, he would find that by the arrangement, which had been adopted at his suggestion, there was not above one statute now for ten times that number formerly, and that the diminution in size was still more considerable, by means of the consolidation which had been carried into effect.&#x2014;According to the view that had been taken of the subject by the hon. member who had spoken last, an important branch had been excepted from the examinations of the commission, which he seemed to think might have been introduced with advantage. Now, he was quite ready to admit the importance of the branch alluded to, but he did not think that questions of this sort, which applied to foreign and colonial interests, could be properly considered as coming within the inquiries of the commission. As far as he could see, its tendency would be, to divert the attention of the commission from objects more immediately within its pursuit, and to make the commissioners, by calling upon them to investigate a subject, the evidence and facts of which were scattered and far removed, entail a heavy burthen of expense upon the country, without any adequate
<col>890</col>
gain being derived from it.&#x2014;He also doubted the prudence of forming the commission on the plan laid down by the hon. and learned mover, especially as he thought the appointment of one committee not sufficient, if the law of real property, and the practice of pleading before the superior courts, were both to be topics of inquiry. He felt bound to state his express opinion, that it would have been much better to have confined the views of the commission to some definite objects, and to have had two commissions instead of one. This arrangement appeared to him to be much preferable to the one proposed; for though it was an old saying&#x2014;and a saying for which they had sacred authority&#x2014;that "in the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom." yet he doubted whether a number of commissioners were more likely to arrive at wise conclusions than a few. He thought it would prove, that the commission would be so encumbered, that continual derangements would take place, from their being so many different views to be brought together. It appeared to him, that if the commission was to consist of five members instead of so many, much more business would be got through, and in a much more effectual manner. Of course he did not mean to say, that in thus limiting their number, they were to decline receiving such assistance as might be proffered by others; but he was sure that there were many important branches of the law which must become objects of inquiry, that would derive infinitely greater benefit from one or two professional persons, than from a much larger number of persons who were unacquainted with the proceedings that would be examined into. The reports of those professional persons might be embraced in the report of the commission; and he was therefore sure, that if there were two commissions appointed, the number would be sufficient. Supposing that the progress of actions through the superior courts of law was to be the object of inquiry for the one commission, and the transfer of real property&#x2014;or in other words and more common acceptation, convey ancing&#x2014;the object of the other, it was clear that greater expedition would be obtained than if one commission had the labour through the vast mass of evidence that those two objects united must necessarily produce.<lb/>
He was also desirous that, when the commission should issue, the Crown
<image src="S2V0018P0I0453"/>
<col>891</col>
should not be precluded from making an inquiry, by its legal advisers, into other objects by which it was possible that much good might be effected, without any additional expense being incurred: and he might more particularly allude to one part of what he thought might well become a portion of its inquiry, which was the alteration of the terms from the order in which they now stood. He did not believe that on this question there would arise any great difficulty; for, as far as he knew, the concurrent opinion of every lawyer was, that such an alteration would be highly expedient and advantageous. The only present difficulty was, that the leisure which occurred at Easter should extend to the bar; and he thought that this might be arranged by the Crown, without the aid of a commission.&#x2014;With respect to what were to be the objects of the inquiry of the commission, he thought it desirable that the House should fully understand what questions were likely to devolve upon it; because, when the House should once be in possession of what were to be the principal objects to which the commission was to direct its attention, they would be able to understand that any discussion at present upon those points would be premature, and that much time would necessarily be saved to the House, by the postponement of the discussion of any question which it should, on all hands, be agreed was a fit object to be referred to the commission. He could assure the hon. and learned gentleman, that he was by no means jealous of the inquiry that he proposed to institute; all that he was anxious about was, that it should be fully defined what were to be the objects which the commission was to have in view; and it was with this feeling that he thought an address, such as the following might be substituted for the one which had been proposed by the hon. and learned gentleman&#x2014;"That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty, respectfully requesting that His Majesty may be pleased to take such measures as may seem most expedient for the purpose of causing due inquiry to be made into the origin, progress, and termination, of Actions in the superior Courts of Common Law in this Country, and matters connected therewith, and into the state of the Law regarding the transfer of Real Property.'" He had certainly made up his mind in favour of there being two commissions, and he thought that it would
<col>892</col>
be much better to try the matter that way, than by the introduction of bills into the House. With respect to the Writs of Error bill, which had been introduced last session, looking at it abstractedly, he could see no objection to it; but, unless other alterations were carried into effect to bear that Act out, it would be of no use.<lb/>
There was one part of the hon. and learned gentleman's speech which he had heard with much regret, because with respect to it he conceived that his proposition was totally inefficient for any practical purpose. He alluded to what the hon. and learned gentleman had said with respect to the great body of the magistracy of this country. For his own part, he knew not how the appointment of the magistracy could be placed in better hands than in those of the highest officer under the Crown; and, in the appointment, he could not see how that high officer could discover the fitness of the individual, except through the medium of some local authority. To suffer such a duty to devolve on the judges would be, in his opinion, infinitely more open to objection, than to leave it to the lord Chancellor. He knew that, with respect to the sheriffs, the judge's opinion was taken; but he did not believe that any advantage was derived from that fact; and indeed how could there, when it was considered how very short the stay of each judge was in the county while passing round on the circuit&#x2014;never exceeding a week, or, at most, a fortnight at a time. He therefore thought he might safely say that the nomination of the sheriffs, as practised at present, offered no inducements to transfer the appointment of magistrates from the custos rotulorum of the county. The hon. and learned gentleman, in finding fault with the system of the unpaid magistracy, appears to have rested the principal strength of his argument on this point, contending, that if the chancellor appoints the magistrate, at least his choice should not be derived from the lord lieutenant of the country to which the magistrate belonged. In examining this question, it would only be necessary to compare the state of England to that of Ireland. In the latter country, as there was more than one person from whom the necessary recommendation came, no one was looked upon as responsible; and the consequence was, that persons were elected who never could have obtained the office
<image src="S2V0018P0I0454"/>
<col>893</col>
had the regulation been the same there as it was in England; and he had always felt that, if one responsible officer could be found in Ireland similar to the lord lieutenant here, it would be a great improvement in the magistracy of that country. In the course of his argument, the hon. and learned gentleman had contended, that half of the mischief of the system was, that the act that was done was not the act of any particular individual, by which two-thirds of the moral responsibility was got rid of. But what would the hon. and learned gentleman have in the place of the present system? He believed that there were in this country about four thousand five hundred magistrates, and though he believed that there might be individual instances of misconduct in members of this numerous body, yet he knew, from experience, that there was no body of men so jealous of the behaviour of the members of their corps as these very magistrates, in most of the complaints that were made of the obnoxious conduct of individuals, it happened that the charge was brought forward by some of his brother magistrates, in order that the subject might be fully investigated; so jealous were they of the honour of their body, and so anxious that no misconduct should escape punishment&#x2014;no offender pass unnoticed, without bringing the penalty that he deserved on his head.<lb/>
With respect to the licensing system, there certainly might be some abuses of it; but how would that be improved by the judges having a control over the appointment of the magistrates? And, if this was so before any alteration took place, the hon. and learned gentleman ought to show what was the local authority on which he intended to confer those powers which were at present vested in them. In touching on such important and extensive subjects as these, it was necessary to look at the whole system: it should be first inquired whether it deserved to be condemned, and then what system might advantageously be proposed in its place. For his own part, he thought that the supercession of the magistrates who were at present acting throughout the country would be a very great evil. He was an advocate for the plan at present existing, because he thought that it contributed to the bringing together of the higher and lower orders of society. The justice of the country must be administered in some way or another; and he should be glad to
<col>894</col>
know in what way it could be administered half so satisfactorily as at present? If the unpaid system was to be changed into a paid one, the consequence would be that there would be an immense number of stipendiary magistrates established. And what would be the salary of that body? In London it had been found necessary to supersede the gratuitous magistrates by the appointment of a stipendiary police; but Mr. Bentham, a gentleman whose works were pretty generally known, objected to the payment of 800<i>l.</i> a year, and said that in France the <i>Juges de Paix,</i> who officiated in a way somewhat similar to our police magistrates, had but a yearly income of from 200<i>l.</i> to 300<i>l.</i> a-year, and he therefore contended that 300<i>l.</i> or400<i>l.</i> a-year; ought to be enough for those of this country. But supposing this to be the amount fixed, was it likely that any number of gentlemen, well acquainted with the law, would be found to undertake such an office for that remuneration? And even then, in whom was the appointment to be vested? Was it to be in the Crown or in the local authorities? Was it to be paid out of a county rate, or out of the public funds? If the latter, what a vast increase of expense there would be to the country; besides which, it would be the means of adding a large number of stipendiary retainers to the Government. Nevertheless, he thought that if such an alteration should take place, it would be better that it should remain with the Crown than with a local authority, as there would be a better security in case any improper person should be appointed. If it were to be in some local authority, there would be great danger that it would be a source of patronage to certain parties, and that the appointments in some instances would rather take place from favour than from merit. He knew that there were some parts of the country where the administration of justice was kept back by the accumulation of manufactures in the neighbourhood, which was not only the means of increasing crime, but of diminishing the number of magistrates, as such works as those frequently contributed to drive away country gentlemen: such cases as these might be found in the Staffordshire Potteries, and in the Welsh iron districts. He did not pretend to deny that there were faults in the unpaid magistracy system, but he, nevertheless, thought it better than any other that could be proposed. Even if he was pre-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0455"/>
<col>895</col>
pared to acquiesce in the assertion, that the system of appointing magistrates was defective to the extent which some hon. gentleman wished the House to believe, he confessed he knew of no system which could possibly be adopted in its place. It was too much the fashion, among a certain class of persons, to censure the conduct of the great body of the magistracy of England. That there were in that body, as in every other numerous class of men, a few who might prove justly liable to that censure, he did not mean to deny; but as a great body, called upon to fulfil one of the most important duties of society, he knew of none in this or in any other country, who performed that duty with greater zeal, with greater integrity, with a more honourable devotion to the interests of their fellow subjects, and with a more satisfactory effect upon the minds of those who were placed under their control. And he contended that, after all, the impression created by any public institution upon the public mind, was the main consideration to be attended to. He could not indeed divest himself of the belief, from all he had heard, and all he had read, that there was a conviction upon the minds of the peasantry of this country favourable to the present system of magisterial appointments, and that the tenantry and neighbours of a country gentleman in the commission of the peace were satisfied there was better and more substantial justice done by their landlord, than they could possibly hope to receive from any stipendiary magistrate, appointed at 500<i>l.</i> a year, or at any other sum, or in any other way which might be devised. That was his conviction; and he believed there was not a member of that House, who would not allow that what he had said upon the subject was in strict conformity with the general impression. If, however, it could be clearly proved that any of this body had misconducted themselves, he was as filling as any other man to consent to any measure which might ensure their removal or their punishment. If, as had been observed on more than one occasion, abuses had been allowed to creep into the administration of impartial justice, particularly in the licensing system, he admitted that the subject deserved the most serious consideration; and if it was found that any of the abuses of that nature were connected with the too unlimited power of the magistrates, he did not hesitate to say, that
<col>896</col>
a remedy ought to be applied to the evil, and that it ought to be checked in that manner which might be found the most speedy and the most effectual. He apprehended, however, that the evil of the licensing system was connected, in a much greater degree, with what was called the small jurisdictions, than the great body of county magistracy.<lb/>
It was not to be supposed that his knowledge or attainments would permit him to go into all the extensive subjects embraced in the speech of the hon. and learned gentleman, upon all those various technical and professional points which that speech involved; he trusted to the acuteness and experience of his hon. and learned friends, the law-officers of the Crown. At the same time he might be permitted to say that, although he was willing to agree generally to the course which the hon. and learned gentleman had recommended, he thought it would be better that the House should not pledge itself to any particular course, or adopt any particular view upon these subjects; but that they should on the contrary, send the matter to the Commission without the adoption or declaration of any particular opinions, as they would thereby be in a better condition to apply a deliberate consideration to the plans or remedies which that Commission might recommend hereafter. He believed that they were all engaged&#x2014;the government, and every individual member of that House&#x2014;in the pursuit of one common object; namely, the improvement of the administration of justice, and the removal of those abuses which may have crept in from the effect of negligence, or the lapse of ages. That such was their common view must be admitted by all, and he confessed he could not conceive what could be the object of any government in protecting or maintaining these abuses. Of this he was certain, that the greatest and the most substantial claim a government could have upon the country, would be an honest desire to secure to the people an impartial, a speedy, and an inexpensive, administration of justice. The matters involved in the hon. and learned gentleman's speech, although deserving the most serious consideration, were, however, too numerous, and involving interests too important, to be disposed of as subjects of legislation, without the deepest inquiry, and the most mature reflection. Those important subjects affected the continuance of a system of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0456"/>
<col>897</col>
things, and a practice of law which had been established for ages, and which was interwoven with all the prejudices, and associated with all the customs and manners, and institutions of the country. Philosophers might affect to disregard these feelings or these prejudices; but in the eyes of all practical men, they were objects deserving the most serious attention. The hon. and learned gentleman had, on a former evening, introduced the name of Cromwell as a member for Cambridge, and as a practical reformer, and had spoken of his great qualities in that respect. He was willing to give credit to all that had been said of him as a practical reformer, and was the more inclined to acquiesce in the statement from the compliment paid him by Mr. Burke, in quoting from the favourite poet of that reformer the following lines:&#x2014;
<quote>"Still as you rise, the State, exalted too,</quote>
<quote>Finds no distemper while 'tis chang'd by you&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>Chang'd like the world's great scene, when, without noise,</quote>
<quote>The rising sun night's vulgar light destroy."</quote>
He did not know whether the person to whom these lines were originally applied deserved them; but he agreed in the opinion which Mr. Burke had given in quoting them, and in the propriety of bringing about a change in this way. Let the subject be seriously considered, let changes be made if they were required; but let them not be made violently or suddenly, and without attention to prejudices which were interwoven with society. With these feelings he was ready to co-operate with the hon. and learned gentleman, who, from the whole tenour of his speech, seemed to entertain the wish that he entertained; namely, that inquiry should precede reform; and it gave him much more pleasure to have an opportunity of thus cooperating with the hon. and learned gentleman, than to propose any adverse amendment to the motion now before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00612"><member>Mr. Sugden</member><membercontribution> then addressed the House. He observed, that it was quite impossible that the numerous, complicated, and varied systems which were touched upon in the speech of his hon. and learned friend, the member for Winchelsea, could be intimately known by all or by any one of the members of the commission, however numerous. The first thing they must do, would be to divide the commission into a number of sub-commissions, if he might be allowed the phrase; and each sub-com-
<col>898</col>
mission must then commence its inquiry into that particular branch of law with which its members might happen to be most conversant. Nothing could be more natural than that such a division must take place. One set of commissioners would sit upon an inquiry into the practice of Common Law. Another would enter upon an investigation of that part of our legal system with which he had the honour to be connected, the practice and principles of a court of Equity&#x2014;and a third would turn their attention to the duties of that part of the profession who generally transacted their business at chambers, and were known by the name of conveyancers. It would seem, therefore, that if the proposition of the hon. and learned gentleman, for an extended commission, was agreed to, that their inquiries must either from their extent be ineffectual, or attended with this great inconvenience&#x2014;that they were to be divided into separate bodies, who were to investigate separate portions of the objects of inquiry; while the whole report, which was to contain the aggregate mass of the recommendations of the commission, and which is suffered to come before the House with the sanction of all the members of that commission, would not emanate from the minds of all those members, but from the few who were acquainted with and interested in the objects of the inquiry.<lb/>
No one was more desirous than he was to see the abuses which may have gradually crept into the administration of the law effectually reformed; but he confessed be looked with no little alarm at the disposition which he saw beginning to prevail, of attempting rash innovations, and striking, under the vain hope of amendment, at the root of that system, under which the country had flourished for ages. Laws, he considered, not to be so much made by the wisdom of man as to have been formed and improved by time; and he thought that nothing was more absurd in that point of view, than to suppose that any individual, however profound his wisdom, or extensive his knowledge, could form a code of laws, for the purpose of governing the property and rights of the people, and thereby supersede all the wisdom of the ages which were past. He hoped, therefore, that the House would riot sanction too large or too extensive an inquiry, which might have the effect of setting men's minds afloat upon points which the experience of time had sanctioned, although the reasons
<image src="S2V0018P0I0457"/>
<col>899</col>
which supported them, or the principles upon which they were founded, might not be immediately apparent.<lb/>
He had already declared, that he was not ready to go the full length of the proposition of his hon. and learned friend upon the extent of the commission; but he saw no objection to the commissions proposed by the right hon. Secretary. He begged leave, however, to say a few words upon that part of the propositions of the right hon. gentleman which went to the appointment of additional judges to the courts of Common Law. He believed it was admitted that it would be highly inexpedient to meddle with the court of Common Pleas; for nothing could be more true than what was observed by the learned Solicitor-general, that the gentlemen connected with one bar, were not likely to leave their own bar to practise at any other. He thought, however, that the court of Exchequer might with the greatest advantage be remodelled; and that if an extra judge was appointed to that court, upon whom would devolve the equitable jurisdiction, the whole of the cases in Equity might be despatched with all the rapidity&#x2014;if rapidity was desirable&#x2014;which the public could require. No one could possibly doubt that the present, judges of the court of Chancery were incapable, not from any deficiency of ability, but he might say unequal to the despatch of all the business which came before them; but if their exertions were united to those of the judges appointed in the court of Exchequer, in the manner proposed, he had no doubt the system would work well, and that the court of Chancery would then be able to get through all the cases which came before it, with as much celerity as any of the other courts, in proportion to the nature of its proceedings. In making these observations upon the courts of Equity, he thought it right to observe, that if a judge was so appointed in the court of Exchequer, it ought to be understood that no appeals were to go from his decisions. If appeals were to go from a third judge of Equity so appointed, he was convinced that, in a very short space of time, the head of the court of Chancery would be, by the number of appeals from the decision of the other courts, rendered incapable of exercising any original jurisdiction. Be was not, indeed, quite certain that appeals might not be very much reduced in number, if they were to be obtained only at a greater expense; At the present moment, an appeal
<col>900</col>
might be entered into on the payment of the small sum of five pounds ten shillings, or some trifle of that kind; and he knew, of his own knowledge, that they were often so entered with the single hope of a something turning up, in the course of the proceedings which might prove favourable to the party's view of the case. He was sure that the noble lord who presides with so much skill and ability over the proceedings of the court of Chancery, might, by a very few beneficial rules, stop up the progress of much of this species of litigation.<lb/>
The hon. and learned member for Winchelsea, at the commencement of his address, had stated his determination not to interfere with the proceedings of the court of Equity, or with the system which regulated the disposal of real property; and yet it was not a little singular to find, after such a statement, that much the greater part of his speech was directed against the proceedings in Equity, and with regard to real property. In the first place, the hon. and learned gentleman, in speaking upon the question of taking account, seemed to be of opinion that there ought to be a greater number of masters appointed to take accounts in the court of King's-bench. Now, whether the accounts were taken by the Master of the King's-bench, or the Master of Chancery, they were taken precisely in the same manner, and it made no difference whatever, therefore, whether the accounts were taken by a Master in Chancery, sitting in Southampton-buildings, or by a Master of the King's-bench-walk. No great benefit, therefore, could be derived from that alteration.<lb/>
His hon. and learned friend had then proposed to extend the Statute of Uses, as far as related to absolute trusts. He contended, that it was impossible to do any thing of that kind, and for this reason&#x2014;that as long as the wants and necessities, and social condition of mankind, rendered it requisite that their estates should be vested in trustees, or placed in the hands of mortgagees, so long would they find means to evade any provision of the legislature to the contrary. It would be to reject all the experience of past ages, to say that such would not be the result of his hon. and learned friend's interference, for the Statute of Uses did once, in point of fact, do the very thing which his learned friend desired; but when men began to find that it was necessary to their wants
<image src="S2V0018P0I0458"/>
<col>901</col>
and their wishes, that there should be trusts and limitations, they would find that they did make them in defiance of the Statute of Uses, just as they would again, in defiance of any of the provisions, which his hon. and learned friend might be able to introduce.<lb/>
The remarks and propositions of his hon. and learned friend upon the subject of real property deserved the most serious consideration. If he could be brought to think that these propositions had for their object the subversion of the present law regarding real property, he, for one, should feel it his duty to vote against them. But as he believed the object of his hon. and learned friend was to sweep away the rubbish which time may have cast over the laws relating to such purposes, and as he knew that there was such rubbish, and that there were many such abuses which could be remedied, without in any instance defeating the right of any man to the possession of that property, he should be happy to give his concurrence and assistance.<lb/>
The next subject to which his hon. and learned friend had referred was that of fines and recoveries; and he declared he did not know one lawyer attending Westminster-hall, who was not willing to give his vote for their entire abolition. If, however, his hon. and learned friend desired to alter the law relating to tenant in tail, upon regulating the disposal of the fee-simple, he was determined not to give that proposition his assent. He believed that the law in cases of that kind allowed one of the most perfect train of limitations over the disposal of real estates, which the ingenuity of man could devise. And with all the advantages which it afforded, there was nothing which in the slightest degree trenched upon the real property of the rightful owner. On the contrary, the limitations only took away the power of alienation, without in the slightest degree altering the nature of ownership. He would put the case in as plain a way as possible to the House. Suppose a man had a real estate, and was disposed to marry, his object would be to leave himself a life-interest in his property, and yet provide a jointure for his wife. If that wife should happen to die before him, he would also wish to have the power of altering the disposition of that jointure in favour of another, if he wished to marry a second time. Then there were to be provisions made
<col>902</col>
for younger children, and power to be retained for letting lands for twenty-one years, upon lease. Now, observe how all these objects were accomplished by the train of limitations. The father was made tenant for life&#x2014;the wife gets a jointure&#x2014;the younger sons and daughters are provided for, and beneficial leases are granted, while it is in the power of the father, the moment the son becomes of the age of twenty-one, to alter all this, and reverse the arrangements, if he sees it expedient; but the son never can dispose of his interest during the life of the father. All these advantages it was proposed to cut away remorselessly, and merely to give the power to limit the estate for life, and to leave it to his son after his death. The French code upon the law of real property had this inconvenience, among others, that in order to simplify the law, it took away the power of limitation, and hardly gave any power of provision or settlement for the younger branches of the family.<lb/>
There were many other subjects on which he wished to make some observations, but he would not then detain the House; and he would merely observe upon that point of the hon. and learned gentleman's speech which required the Statute of Frauds to be extended, and declared it necessary that no contract should be valid, unless stated in writing. He dissented from what was stated on that subject, and was prepared to contend that it was not desirable to require all contracts to be reduced into writing. His hon. and learned friend had quoted the saying of a very learned judge, that "every line of the Statute of Frauds was worth a subsidy." If that learned person had lived to this day, he would have added&#x2014;"to the lawyers," for there was not a line of it which had not cost a subsidy to the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00613"><member>Sir James Scarlett</member><membercontribution> said, that, if he had been disposed to differ with the right hon. Secretary who spoke last but one, in the conclusion he had come to upon this subject, he yet felt so strong a conviction of the right hon. gentleman's sincerity, and thought him so much entitled to the gratitude of the House and the country for his useful labours in reforming the Criminal-law, that he should most readily have surrendered his own opinion to the judgment and experience of the right hon. gentleman. He was bound to say, however, that he entirely concurred in the views taken by the right hon. Secretary upon
<image src="S2V0018P0I0459"/>
<col>903</col>
every one of the topics which he had touched in his speech, and upon none more than upon that which concerned the institution and the appointment of the magistracy of England. He was ready to admit, that there were some defects in the system of their jurisdiction, but he firmly believed that it would not be possible to substitute for the unpaid magistracy any institution more free from defects, or better suited to the feelings of the people.<lb/>
He should follow the example of the right hon. gentleman in abstaining from the discussion of those topics which were to form the subjects of investigation by the commissioners. He thought there was much propriety and good sense in avoiding a previous condemnation of that which was to be submitted to the inquiry of others, whose duty it would be to proceed upon their examination with unbiassed minds, and to report, for the subsequent consideration of the House, the evils which they found to exist, and the remedies which they recommended. He was not one of those who thought it either necessary or useful to excite by criticism and declamation, discontent, and a desire of change with regard to institutions of the deepest practical importance, unless he entertained a decided opinion both upon the advantage of the remedy proposed, and upon the probability of being able to apply it. For this reason he must own that he had entered the House with an opinion which inclined him rather to prefer the introduction of specific and well-considered remedies in the shape of a bill, to the large and almost boundless inquiry to which the speech and motion of his learned friend appeared to be directed.<lb/>
He was the more inclined to this opinion, because it was justified by the example of all the useful reforms in the practice of the law which had taken place in modern times. The greatest and most important of all, was that which had been effected in the fourth year of queen Ann, which he might, by comparison, place among the modern times. That celebrated bill, for the amendment of the law, had been introduced by lord Cowper when keeper of the seals, with the concurrence of the judges, in the House of Lords, and had passed that House in a form much more extensive and efficacious than was found suitable to the opinions or the prejudices of the House of Commons of that day, by whom it had been deprived of many useful parts, and
<col>904</col>
mutilated into the shape in which it was allowed to pass. With this example before him he had certainly been disposed to follow the same course, of maturely considering and digesting some specific plan of reform, and coming ready prepared with the remedies before he invited a discussion of the grievances. He was, however, far from attaching so much importance to this opinion as to make it the ground of opposition to the scheme of his hon. and learned friend; more especially when he had the satisfaction at once to find the principle of useful reform so freely adopted by the right hon. Secretary of State, and the proposed inquiry limited to more specific and practical objects than many of those which were within the range of his hon. and learned friend's speech.<lb/>
Of that most extensive and inviting speech&#x2014;a great part of which he had heard with much satisfaction&#x2014;he could not help saying, that he believed no man who was not possessed of the genius, learning, and astonishing assiduity, which distinguished his hon. and learned friend could, in a short speech of six hours, have comprehended so vast a multitude and variety of important subjects. In that portion of it which he had the pleasure to hear, he had enumerated no less than twenty-nine different topics, each of which might well employ the discussions of the House during an entire session of parliament. It embraced the nature of our laws, their origin, the constitution of our courts of justice, the practice of all courts in England, in Scotland, in our colonies, in the East and in the West, the jurisdiction of the Privy Council, and indeed every part of our civil institutions and domestic policy, excepting the prerogative of the Crown; the jurisdiction of the House of Lords, and the representation of the People; and at the same time, whilst his learned friend was ranging over so wide a field, he had spread through his progress a degree of vivacity which he alone could have introduced to relieve the discussion of so many dull and uninteresting topics. He could find nothing so appropriate to the vastness of his learned friend's comprehension and imagination, as the words which, in the romance of Quintus Curtius, upon the exploits of Alexander the Great, were supposed to have been applied to the hero by certain Scythian ambassadors upon their introduction to him&#x2014;"Si dii habitum corporis tui, aviditati animi parem esse voluissent, orbis te non
<image src="S2V0018P0I0460"/>
<col>905</col>
caperet. Alter&#x00E2; manu Orientem, alter&#x00E2; Occidentem contingeres." His hon. and learned friend had, indeed, already raised one gentleman from the East, and he thought he perceived symptoms of another rising from the West. Like Alexander he hastened from Europe to Asia, and again from Asia back to Europe. It was not his intention to follow his learned friend. He would content himself by saying generally, that he approved of many of his observations, that he concurred with him in noting many of the defects, and in recommending some of the remedies he had pointed out. But he was bound to say, on the other hand, that there were many instances in which he was far from admitting the evils, and more still in which he doubted of the remedies which his hon. and learned friend had discovered. It was ever an easy task to point out the defects of human institutions, none of which could be perfect, but it was extremely difficult to find the true remedy, and often still more difficult when you had found it, to prevail on mankind to adopt it. In his own profession, for example, he was convinced that almost all men would agree in condemning certain abuses in the practice of the law, but that scarcely ten would be found to concur in any particular reform. Thus, by a very easy process of exposing faults, and through the impossibility of agreeing upon reforms, the time might soon arrive when we should be unable to endure either the evils or the remedies.<lb/>
He trusted, therefore, that he might be forgiven when the defects of our institutions were brought under review, if he ventured to point out one peculiar excellency which, in his opinion placed them far above those of all other nations. It was the peculiar felicity of England, that the administration of justice was in the hands of the people. The unpaid magistracy were a part of the people deeply interested in maintaining their rights and liberties. The grand juries at the assizes and quarter-sessions, the petty juries every where were the people: they formed the main part of the whole machine for administering justice, both civil and criminal. This privilege, of which we had so much reason to boast, was the cause of many of the supposed anomalies and defects which deprived our system of that theoretical perfection without which some ingenious minds would never be satisfied.<lb/>
The House would, perhaps, pardon him
<col>906</col>
if he ventured to illustrate this position by a reference to the law of evidence, which had been adduced as a fit subject for censure by his hon. friend, the member for Dungarvon (Mr. G. Lamb). He was ready to admit that there were certain decisions upon the subject of evidence, which might well deserve revision; but he would say generally, that the nature of our tribunals for the determination of litigated facts, required that certain kinds of testimony should be altogether excluded, from which tribunals differently constituted might often derive information without any danger of being misled. When the historian in his study investigates some obscure and controlled question of fact in times that are past, it becomes him to consider every species of evidence from which light, however faint, may be procured. Even hear-say evidence is within his province, and may often furnish him with satisfactory information. If highly-educated judges or lawyers were to decide upon matters of fact, there would be no sound reason for excluding any species of testimony from men whose minds were accustomed to the nice investigation of probabilities, and competent to adjust exactly the weight that may be due to each description of evidence, and the personal motives that might affect the credit of each witness. But juries, who were the arbiters of fact in this country, were composed of men of various degrees of intelligence, and of various habits of life; fully competent to follow the broad and obvious lines of distinction, which most cases presented, with regard to the weight of testimony and the credibility of witnesses, but not adapted to the nice and metaphysical discussions which the consideration of doubtful and secondary evidence always involves. He was, therefore, of opinion, that constituted as our courts were, hear-say evidence could not be admitted without danger. He had often experienced that undue weight was given to it where it had been admitted, and that it had sometimes influenced the jury to a conclusion in which the judge could not concur. His learned friend had also alluded to the rejection of the testimony of the plaintiff or defendant in his own cause.</membercontribution></p>

<col>907</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00617"><member>Sir J. Scarlett</member><membercontribution> said, he was ready to ask pardon of his learned friend for the use of that unlucky word "also," and, if he would not further interrupt him, would inform him, that he was alluding not to him, but to the hon. member for Dungarvon; who, besides other observations on the rules of evidence, though not relating to hear-say, had mentioned the rejection of the testimony of a party in his own cause. Now, he was conscious that he might be thought an incompetent judge of the merits of a system of which he was in the daily practice. It was too true, that men were apt to be prepossessed by their own habits and practice, and he perhaps ought to entertain a doubt of the value of his own opinion upon the rule in question. But he could state as a fact, that, during the course of a long personal experience, he never above twice or thrice in his life found it expedient to read the answer of an opponent upon oath obtained by a bill of discovery. In fact, men hardly ever thought themselves in the wrong in their own causes; the necessary result of which was, that they told their own story, even upon oath, so much in their own favour; that it was impossible for their antagonists to use it. A court of Equity would not permit the answer of a party to be read as evidence in his own behalf. And he was sorry, but bound to state, that in a very recent instance, when a court of Equity had directed a party to be examined in a court of law, in support of his own case, the most gross perjury had taken place. Upon this point, he repeated, that the constitution of the tribunal renders it proper to exclude such testimony. A judge might, perhaps, make due allowance for the passions and feelings which excite a party in his own cause; but if such evidence were adduced before a jury it would throw upon the advocate, in every case, the necessity of offering to them in each address, an essay upon human nature, and metaphysical dissertations upon the influence of motives upon the conduct and feelings of men, which would be thrown away before such a tribunal. Dissertations of this nature, as his hon. and learned friend, the member for Winchelsea, well knew were too frequent in the lengthy pleadings of the Scots' courts, which were addressed to most intelligent judges, but which, however proper in those courts, would serve only to confound and perplex a jury.<lb/>
In making these observations, he was
<col>908</col>
most anxious not to be understood as desiring to oppose any obstacle to any sort of practicable reform, even upon the law of evidence. Indeed he felt it due to himself to state, that there was no man more ready to lend a favourable attention to any suggestion for the amendment and substantial improvement of the institutions which he held in reverence; and he trusted he should not be accused by his hon. and learned friend of a desire to rob him of any portion of the glory which belonged to him, as the proposer of these inquiries, when he stated that, if he had continued in office, he was prepared to have submitted a bill to the consideration of the House for the purpose of accomplishing some of the objects which his hon. and learned friend had now in view. So long ago as the year 1812, he had, in communication with that most learned and excellent judge, the late Mr. justice Le Blanc, digested and prepared the heads of a bill, which it had been his intention to submit to parliament. But experience had taught him, soon after his admission into that House, that no measure of such magnitude could advantageously be proposed by one who did not possess the authority and influence of government; more especially if he were deeply engaged in pursuits which made his attendance in parliament uncertain. He had, therefore, vainly reserved it for an opportunity which was gone by almost as soon as it had occurred.<lb/>
If he did not trespass too much upon the House, he would throw out for the consideration of his hon. and learned friends opposite, one of the suggestions which he had intended to make. He alluded to the process between creditor and debtor. It was easy to perceive that the law which regulated the interest of these parties could never be made agreeable to both. The creditor looked for expedition in the process; certainty in the law, despatch in the decision, facility in the execution: the debtor, on the other hand, naturally sought for investigation, caution, discussion, delay. It was impossible to satisfy the exigency of both. That in consulting the eagerness of the creditor for an expeditious termination, it was necessary to afford to the honest defendant some time for reasonable preparation, deliberate discussion, and security from oppression. The difficulty was, how to prevent the fraudulent or needy debtor from availing himself of all those delays and precautions which
<image src="S2V0018P0I0462"/>
<col>909</col>
were provided for the security of the honest and the protection of the innocent. He had found that, generally speaking, the debtor was enabled by taking advantage of every means of delay which the practice of the courts afforded, to put off the day of final judgment for almost six months, and then, by the aid of a writ of error to add a few months more. But this time was gained at a great expense to both parties, often exceeding what was required, to pay the original demand. For example, the whole proceeding, from the commencement of the suit to judgment upon the writ of error, he had ascertained would cost the defendant above eighty pounds, which he either raised by small contributions amongst his friends from time to time, or eked out of his own earnings in order to put off the evil day of paying a just debt, which amounted at first, perhaps, to no more than thirty or forty pounds. The remedy he had thought of suggesting was this&#x2014;that the delay which was now gained by a process most expensive to both parties, through indirect means, should be obtained cheaply and directly, provided it were made the price of a condition advantageous to the plaintiff. What he should propose was this:&#x2014;Suppose a man to be served with a process, and to have no other immediate object than to gain time, he might be allowed to go at once before a commissioner, and obtain a delay of three months, upon giving competent bail, who at the expiration of that time should see the debt paid, or render him; or even a delay of six months, upon condition, that if he did not then pay the debt, the bail should be liable to pay it themselves. The debtor would thus be able to husband his resources, in order to make provision, against the day of payment, whilst the creditor, without being exposed to any further expense or loss, would improve his chance of recovering his demand within the usual time.&#x2014;Another object which he had in view was, to limit the power of arrest to debts exceeding one hundred pounds. He did not mean to give an opinion at present upon the general subject of the law of arrest&#x2014;whether the practice ought or ought not to be abandoned. He believed that when the commercial body came to be examined before the commission, the preponderating opinion would be found to be that it ought not to be given up. But he would do no more at present than observe, that, if the power of personal arrest were with-
<col>910</col>
drawn, it would be necessary to give some very improved means of getting at the property of defendants, who otherwise might live, where they were fraudulently disposed, upon means placed entirely beyond the reach of their creditors; upon funds, for instance, supplied from the produce of money vested in foreign stocks, or upon the rents of estates abroad.&#x2014;The hon. and learned gentleman concluded by declaring, that at so advanced an hour, he should refrain from longer occupying the attention of the House. He should always be ready to promote every reform which was consistent with the safety of the general system of the English law; and it was impossible for him too warmly to bear testimony to the talent and exertion with which his hon. and learned friend had brought the subject forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00618"><member>Dr. Phillimore</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to offer a few words upon the constitution of a court in which himself had practised for many years; namely, the court of Delegates. The House would be aware that this court, which was the last tribunal of appeal from the maritime and ecclesiastical courts, had been a source of complaint for more than a century; repeated applications having been made within that time to the Crown to change the constitution of it. As the practice stood, the court was composed of three common-law judges, whom it was difficult to get together, and who, when assembled, were not familiar, from their professional habits and experience, with the civil law: and to assist these learned persons, three counsel from the court were added, who were necessarily always of those not immediately in the highest estimation, as those who were so were generally concerned on one side or the other in the cause. The delay which the difficulty of assembling the common-law judges led to, rendered the court almost valueless for the despatch of business. But the most glaring part of the grievance was the incompetency of the constitution of that tribunal: the decisions of the first civil judges were reviewed by judges not practising the civil law at all, and by assistant counsel, whose standing and reputation were by no means necessarily such as to qualify them for so delicate a duty. The hon. and learned member concluded by suggesting an improvement in the constitution of the court; the chief feature of which was, that one civil judge should, in all cases, sit with the court of Delegates, for the purpose of as-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0463"/>
<col>911</col>
sisting it; that when the appeal was from an ecclesiastical court, a judge of the court of Admiralty should be in attendance; and an ecclesiastical judge, in the same way, upon every admiralty appeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00619"><member>Mr. Carter</member><membercontribution> shortly observed upon that part of the inquiry, which was to apply to the power intrusted to magistrates. In his opinion, the power of transportation for life was a very dangerous one to be exercised at quarter-sessions by persons whose habits of receiving evidence, when not directed or controlled by any presiding barrister, were frequently highly lax and irregular.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00620"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> commenced his reply by assuring the House, that the patient attention with which he had been heard by the House on a former evening, when he brought the important subject of the administration of the law under its consideration, would induce him to trespass but for a short time on its patience at that late hour. It was the more unnecessary, indeed, for him to do so, as the observations which had been made that evening did not furnish any very ample matter of remark in reply from him. He had, in the first place, to discharge a duty imposed on him by his hon. and learned friend (sir J. Scarlett) who had been obliged to leave the House; namely, the explanation of a point which his hon. and learned friend had omitted to notice; and which he was about to enter upon after his observations on the speech of the hon. member for Dungarvon, but which he had been prevented from doing by his (Mr. B.'s) accidental interruption. The point to which he alluded, referred to the practice of special pleading, which had been attacked by the hon. member for Dungarvon. Upon this point he agreed with his hon. and learned friend; and he was glad to be confirmed in his opinion by an authority of such high experience and talent, that all that was wanting to render special pleading perfectly competent to its purpose, was to bring back the system to its ancient rigour and simplicity. He would have the pleadings made simple, to prevent misconstruction and misapprehension; but in confining the power to plead, and in diminishing the number of counts, he would not leave, as at present, the judges with the power of nonsuiting the parties, because some trivial and verbal mistake had been committed. That would be a great injustice. So many counts were now necessary, be-
<col>912</col>
cause the court was always determined, on the slightest variance, to nonsuit. One of these evils made the other partly necessary; and he was aware that, if he were to reduce the number of counts in a pleading, without doing away the power of nonsuiting for slight variations, that he should cause a great many evils; he would, therefore, get rid of both. The connection between these two things illustrated the necessity of examining the whole law at once. If they were to get rid of the multitude of pleas without getting rid of the causes for nonsuit, it would introduce such confusion, that they might as well shut up the courts. To touch only a part of the law might cause much mischief; but it would be a great good to touch and amend the whole.&#x2014;To the objections of his hon. and learned friend, who had left the House, he would make no further reply, than to state, that his hon. and learned friend must not consider, because he did not answer them, that he thought them unanswerable. His hon. and learned friend, who had left the House, had alluded to the great range of argument in his speech the other night, praising him, whilst he rallied him, for endeavouring to comprise in one speech, however long, twenty-nine heads of argument on the law and the administration of justice. Certainly he confessed that, at first sight, it did appear that there was some ground for the objection; but his answer was, that in order to gain the attention of the House once for all, he thought this course expedient. It was hopeless for him to be able to obtain the attention of the House, let him solicit it how he might, frequently. The subject was barren and dry; and it was impossible to treat it concisely. Could he expect that the House would attend to the same subject night after night, week after week, and session after session? The House also was not the only party to be considered. They sat there in the face of the country; and it was well known that there was no subject in which the people of England took more interest&#x2014;and God forbid that this interest should ever diminish&#x0021;&#x2014;none which came, as was often said, "more home to their business and bosoms"&#x2014;none which the people had more at heart&#x2014;than an ample, unsparing, but judicious,&#x2014;a temperate, but deliberate and advised,&#x2014;reformation of the law, carried into execution by those hands, who, by previous experience, were best enabled to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0464"/>
<col>913</col>
carry it into effect for the benefit of the people, which, from an intimate acquaintance with the subject and long practice, were the best qualified to perform the task. The people, he believed, did not desire a sweeping reform&#x2014;did not wish to see the whole altered&#x2014;but they did wish to see the axe laid to the root of all abuses, but laid by deliberate, skilful, and dispassionate men, sparing all that was valuable, but cutting away what was useless. They did demand, that cheap and speedy justice should be the system of the country. They did not desire hasty or imperfect justice; for they were of opinion, as he was, that though cheap justice was a great good, great injustice was a great evil, let it be ever so cheap and speedy. He had had many opportunities of ascertaining the opinion out of doors, and from all the inquiries he had been able to make, he believed that the minds of the people of this country were earnestly bent on law-reform. Other reforms and retrenchments were indeed desirable, if there were any means of retrenchment, with thirty or forty millions of taxes. But, as men saw no hope of much retrenchment with these thirty or forty millions of taxes, they said, "at least let us have all the reform we can have in other matters." Thus it appeared to him to be his duty, when he brought the subject before the House, to cover a large space with the inquiry: the country looked for it; and if any part had been left untouched, it would have been said&#x2014;"What signifies your doing this? why did you not do that? this is not objected to; do not meddle with this, but that." He had thought it therefore better to bring all the topics before the House at once; and if the House chose to take it up in parts, it might. Lest it should be supposed that he had indulged in a display of professional knowledge, he declared to the House that he had no vain or conceited motive whatever. God knew, he had had enough of professional displays in his time&#x0021; But he was bound to do what he had done; namely, to suggest not a single alteration, or remedy of an evil, of which he had not practical experience, or of which he had not had actual knowledge, from being concerned for one party or the other in court.&#x2014;He stated this to meet the objection that would be made to suggestions of speculatists, theorists, and men who were not practical lawyers, and by thus limiting himself, he thought he had ob-
<col>914</col>
viated all objections. It had been said' and truly said, that it was easy to complain of abuses, but very difficult to point out a remedy for them. No one was more sensible of the truth of this saying than he was. This arose from the imperfection of all human institutions; the errors in which it was much easier to discover than to rectify. It might happen that he had not been right in some of the remedies he had suggested for an abuse, although he was right as to the abuses themselves, because they were existing things: the remedies suggested for them could not be appreciated until they had been tried by the test of experience. He, however, had not stated a single evil for which he had not suggested&#x2014;not dogmatically, but for inquiry and investigation&#x2014;a remedy. In the course of the observations which had been made upon his speech, he did not think that any one part of it had been specifically objected to&#x2014;there had been general objections, indeed&#x2014;except on the subject of evidence, by his learned friend, the Solicitor-general; and his learned friend, Mr. Sugden, who had honoured him by answering a speech which had been made long before he was a member of parliament [a laugh]. His hon. and learned friend had evidently derived his knowledge of his (Mr. Brougham's) arguments, from sources to which he was not authorized to allude; but the uncertainty of such reports, where a little line and a half sometimes comprehended an argument which had occupied a quarter of an hour in the delivery, was obvious. He did not wish to say any thing disparaging of those gentlemen by whom the speech was abridged; they were doubtless very excellent gentlemen; they merited no unkindness from him; but it was evident that such reports, where a line and a half was given to every quarter of an hour, could not give any thing like a complete picture of a speech of such minute and delicate details, in which the mistake of a single word, of "fee" for "life," for example, might work the utmost confusion in the argument. It was dangerous to answer a speech, when only notes of it, like that to which he had alluded, had alone been seen; but his learned friend would learn better hereafter. His learned friend had quite mistaken him if he supposed that he wished to make any change whatever in the law respecting real property, or to alter, in any respect, the power which a man had over such property. He
<image src="S2V0018P0I0465"/>
<col>915</col>
did not mean to say, "let us sweep away fine and recovery, and convert the first tenant in tail to the first tenant"&#x2014;he did not mean that; but he meant that some precise and simple form of words should place the first tenant in tail in precisely the same situation that he was before he had suffered the recovery, or before he levied the fine. He meant to allow the tenant in fee, with the concurrence of the tenant for life, to bar a remainder as at present, but he would accomplish that by a more simple method. He was aware of the utility of this part of our law, and he would not alter it; for its use was to prevent young persons falling into improper hands, and interfering with the stability of family settlements. He would give the two tenants this power by a writ of enfeoffment, or by any valid assurance of two persons. He would not say that, in another country, such as the United States of America, a different modification of landed property might not exist; but in our mixed government, one element of which was a landed aristocracy, he thought we had chosen a happy medium, which it would be impolitic to touch or alter, securing as it did, on the one hand, to the parties a full power over their property, and securing the stability of the aristocracy, and still leaving on the other a sufficiency of land coming into the market for all the purposes of commerce. The law of England, he repeated, preserved, on this difficult point, a happy medium. He would let this part of the law remain as the foundation stone of all: he would only endeavour to make its operation perfect, by allowing all parties to do what the law now allowed them to do, as easily as possible. He agreed entirely with his learned friend, that the tenant in fee should retain all his power over the property; but he could not agree with him, that all the niceties of this part of the law should be preserved; for example, on looking into a very excellent book, "Sugden on Powers," he found such niceties there described, that while it was very difficult for a learned man to tell what powers he was conveying, and what the words he employed signified in the eye of the law, it was quite impossible for the unlearned man to do so. Instead of these niceties he would adopt some formulas, such as were supplied to unlearned magistrates, that the commitments they made out might be correct; and by such formulas he would allow property to
<col>916</col>
be devised and conveyed. There was then, he believed, no real difference between him and his learned friend, but as to the niceties of this part of the law.&#x2014;He would next proceed to say one or two words respecting some other points that had been adverted to. He would first observe, that he had laid before the House a great number of facts, and not a little law, and that three weeks had passed since he had made his speech. This was as favourable as possible for those who wished to answer it. But, after all the pains and care of his learned friend, the Solicitor-general, he had not been able, with great candour, and as much kindness towards him as his duty to the House and regard for his own reputation would allow&#x2014;he had not been able, after three weeks' consideration, to object to one tittle of that statement, with regard to the laws which he (Mr. Brougham) had made. With respect to the facts, his learned friend had stated that he had made one mistake as to the Exchequer; but his learned friend, it turned out, had mistaken the case; for in the one he alluded to, the Crown had defended Mead. His learned friend had defended his view, by saying the Crown had the power to pray a <i>tales,</i> because it was supposed the Crown was the prosecutor; but, in the case he alluded to, the Crown had been the defender of Mead, and by refusing to pray a <i>tales,</i> had stopped the course of justice. By this power, many persons might escape punishment who merited it; and he, therefore, hoped it would be reformed. In the case of Mead, after an expense of 10,000<i>l.</i>, the Crown&#x2014;not, as was supposed, a disinterested party, but an enemy in the heart of the camp&#x2014;stepped in, refused to pray a <i>tales,</i> and put an end to the prosecution. The conduct of Mead he considered as infamous as any man's conduct ever was. He had been found guilty by one jury, and the Exchequer jury, by their verdict, shewed that they regarded him as guilty of perjury; and thus, in fact, he was convicted by two juries. If Law had not been killed, if he had had another 10,000<i>l.</i> to expend, Mead would have been found guilty a second time; but when Law was killed, under very suspicious circumstances, there was an end to the whole proceeding.&#x2014;With respect to another case alluded to by the Solicitor-general, of the petition of right, what he (Mr. Brougham) objected to was, that the Crown should have the power of refusing to grant such a petition,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0466"/>
<col>917</col>
in cases in which the Crown was concerned, after a lapse of twenty years; and he complained that the Crown should not, in this respect, stand in the same situation as a private party.&#x2014;His hon. friend, who had lately returned from India (Mr. Fergusson), had stated his own view of the case: he had alluded to it as it had fallen under his own observation. The description he (Mr. Brougham) had given of it was drawn from the notes of the judge. What he had complained of was the delay, and that the property should, in the mean time, be attached by a sheriff's officer. The law was, perhaps, wise, but the results he had stated were certainly sufficient to warrant all he had said on the subject. The hon. and learned gentleman then came to the subject of extending the trial by jury in the East Indies, and begged to read to the House an extract from a speech delivered in 1820, by the late sir Hardinge Giffard, the chief justice of Ceylon, which had just come into his possession. Previously, however, he begged to explain, that in mentioning the story of the Brahmin juryman of Ceylon&#x2014;which, it was said, showed the danger of allowing natives to sit on juries&#x2014;he had merely intended to show, that the vehement prejudice of a jury had been checked by one unprejudiced person, who had discovered such amazing ability in analyzing the evidence. The passages he should read were most important:&#x2014;"It is too well recorded," said sir Hardinge, addressing the magistrates of Columbo, "and is within the personal knowledge of some of yourselves, that during the Candyan war of 1803, the revolt of some of our maritime districts added, in no slight degree, to the difficulties of that melancholy period. It has been my duty to examine the criminal calendars of that period, with a view to inform myself of the state of offences generally, and I have been both surprised and gratified to observe, that during this interval&#x2014;an interval marked by violence and convulsion in the interior&#x2014;there does not appear to have occurred in our maritime provinces a single instance of even a charge of turbulence, sedition, or treason, or of any offence bearing the slightest tinge of a political character. To what are we to attribute so remarkable a change? Certainly not to the superior character of the government; in mildness and benevolence Mr. North's administration was assuredly not exceeded by that of any of
<col>918</col>
his successors. But let us ascribe it to the true causes&#x2014;to the long and steady experience of the blessings of a government, administered on British principles, and above all, to the introduction of the trial by jury. To this happy system, now deeply cherished in the affections of the people, and revered as much as any of their oldest and dearest institutions, I do confidently ascribe this pleasing alteration; and it may be boldly asserted, that while it continues to be administered with firmness and integrity, the British government will hold an interest in the hearts of its Cingalese subjects, which the Portuguese and Dutch possessors of this island were never able to establish." Sir Hardinge then cited a report of the advocate fiscal, who said, "Amongst the inhabitants of the maritime provinces, I know the jury system to be already a favourite; the wisdom of the Supreme Court has most happily adapted it, even to their prejudices." Now he (Mr. Brougham) said, "you had better trust to the hearts of the people of India than to 250,000 sepoys, who, though excellent troops, were, perhaps, of doubtful fidelity." The fiscal added, "Armies may waste away from climate or disease, and seasons and circumstances may baffle the utmost exercise of human foresight; but fixed on the attachment of the people to our jurisprudence, I look upon the security of the British interests in Ceylon to be impregnable." The idea of jury-trial in India was by no means novel and modern in its origin. A usage which closely resembled this mode of administering justice, as to principle, in times of great antiquity, prevailed throughout that country. It was essentially a species of arbitration, and decided such cases as came under the cognizance of juries, by a reference to five men, who gave judgment according to their opinion upon the evidence.&#x2014;The next point to which he desired to refer, was an impression that he had passed one unsparing, universal, indiscriminate, and sweeping, censure upon the whole system by which magistrates, and every thing relating to magisterial jurisdiction were regulated. This was the charge to which any man was necessarily liable, who brought forward any system for the purpose of pointing out the errors which existed in it. Such a man, so engaged, did not stop to panegyrize the valuable parts of that system. His object was to shew that there were imperfections in it which ought to be corrected.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0467"/>
<col>919</col>
But it was not fair to call observations of that nature a vague and general accusation of the whole system. For himself, he highly respected the voluntary zeal which induced many individuals to take upon themselves the magisterial functions: he well knew that many of those individuals were highly useful and deserved the gratitude of the community. But that which he had said, and which he was prepared to maintain was, that, unless a change was made either in the mode of nominating or appointing magistrates, or in their manner of acting, or in their responsibility, the continuance of the present system must be pregnant with great evils. He had never doggedly maintained that the present mode of nomination must, under any circumstances be altered. His statement had been, that whether that mode was right or wrong, or even if it should turn out to be impossible to devise a better, at all events those judges should be so nominated that they might be under much more control than they were at present. If they continued to be appointed by the lord-lieutenant of the county, it must be recollected, that the lord-lieutenant was subject to less responsibility for his choice than other authorities would be; that he was liable to be biassed by local feelings; by private favour and affection; by the services which certain individuals might have rendered, or might be capable of rendering, his family; by the solicitation of friends; by a disposition to mutual accommodation, either with persons of rank and influence in his own county, or with the lords-lieutenant of other counties. But was not his argument irrefutable&#x2014;that if that mode of appointment, acknowledged to be imperfect and exposed to inevitable abuse, must be resorted to, it became the more absolutely necessary that the individuals so appointed, should be made strictly responsible for the manner in which they exercised their authority? He had said, in his address to the House, on introducing this subject, that the judges of the land were responsible by name, and in their own proper persons, for the judgments which they gave. It was the judgment of lord Tenterden, or Mr. Justice Bailey, or Mr. Justice Holroyd, or Mr. Justice Littledale. Their decisions were liable to be reviewed over and over again. They were liable to be reviewed in their own courts, and they were liable to be reviewed by the assembled Judges in the other courts. And who were the individuals who were so responsible by name,
<col>920</col>
and in their proper persons? Not insufficient lawyers, not ignorant men, not inexperienced persons, not individuals chosen by a lord-lieutenant; but individuals chosen by a minister responsible for the selection, and whose duty it was, out of the whole profession of the law, to nominate those who were most distinguished for their professional talents, for their extensive knowledge and experience, and for the soundness of their judgment. So chosen, and so superior these learned persons were responsible for their conduct in the manner which he had described. Yet the justices of the peace, not so chosen, not so qualified, were exempt from such responsibility. What was his conclusion? Not to abolish the whole unpaid magistracy of the country: he had never dreamt of such a thing; but to apply some remedy to the existing evil. To limit the number of sessions&#x2014;to limit the number of magistrates sitting at the sessions&#x2014;to make it clear that the same individuals would always be present, that of itself would be a considerable improvement. He was delighted to hear his learned friend state, that many of the magistrates would jump to get rid of that portion of their present duties which related to the licensing of public houses. He heartily concurred with his learned friend in the expediency of such a change; and he would jump, though perhaps he could not jump so high as some persons, to see it accomplished. He was most desirous to put an end to the licensing system. According to his learned friend, many of the magistrates thought it a great burthen and grievance to themselves; the people at large, he knew, thought it a great burthen and grievance to themselves. In God's name, therefore, why not get rid of it? And here he thought it but right to observe, that a friend of his had spoken to him on the subject of the letter which he had read the other night in the House, stating, that the establishment of the Goldenlane Brewery had for the time lowered the price of porter; and had assured him, that the statement was destitute of foundation. He repeated, that in the observations which had fallen from him on the occasion, to which he had so frequently alluded, in all that he had said of "justice's juice," &amp;c, he had by no means intended to allude to the respectable portion of the country magistracy. But that great abuses existed in the licensing system was evident, even from the report of a committee of the House it-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0468"/>
<col>921</col>
self; in which report a frightful picture was drawn of the conduct of some of the licensing justices; and more especially of the clerical justices, who it was evident (he was sorry to say it) bore the bell in point of impropriety. That report made good the doctrine which he had lately held; namely, that a mixture of the ingredients of a clergyman and a justice of the peace, though each might be good in itself, frequently made a very nauseous compound.&#x2014;There was one point on which he wished to say a few words. Since he had first brought the subject under the consideration of the House, he had been overwhelmed with letters. Ever since the matter had been circulated throughout the country, he had received from twenty to thirty letters a day respecting it. These letters came from two descriptions of persons;&#x2014;from justices of the peace, and from practitioners in the law; the greater number perhaps from the latter. He was happy to say, with reference to the letters which he had received from magistrates, that so far were the writers from considering that he had been captious or unjust towards their body, that they expressed the greatest gratitude to him for what he was doing, and declared that no men could be more sensible than themselves of the necessity of a reform in the system; more especially in that part of it which related to the licensing of public-houses.&#x2014;By the by, would the House permit him to make a single observation with respect to these letters? He begged, then, to express his hope, that the writers of them would not conceive that he was deficient in personal respect because he left them unanswered. Many of them contained highly valuable suggestions; information of great importance, with reference both to the facts and to the law. But, not having a secretary, he was wholly unable, with his other avocations, to answer one half of them, if he were to attempt the task. The consequence of this conviction was, that he had determined to answer none. He had thought it necessary to say this in vindication, not more of himself than of others. He had frequently seen members of that House annoyed, attacked, and threatened by correspondence in newspapers, who, fancying that they had more time and power by half than they really possessed, became exceedingly wrath when they found that their communications remained unanswered. Gentlemen in the country ought to recollect, that a member
<col>922</col>
of parliament could not reply to all the letters he received; and that his abstaining from doing so ought not to be attributed to any want of respect for the writer. Every county member knew how serious was the evil to which he alluded; and how frequently their correspondents thought themselves slighted when no offence of any kind was intended. To revert to the letters which he had received on this subject, the writers all, without a single exception, joined in declaring the necessity of a law reform; and in expressing their gratitude to the House of Commons, for having shown a disposition to entertain the question. He now came to the main point&#x2014;the form in which the motion should be submitted to the House. He was quite ready to adopt the words recommended by the right hon. Secretary. At the same time, he certainly wished that some other subjects were comprehended. The commercial law, for instance, required great revision; and in no parts of it more than the law of merchant and factor, and the laws of partnership. The latter especially were so intricate, that it was frequently exceedingly difficult to determine what a partnership actually was&#x2014;whether A was really a partner with B or not. He also lamented the exclusion of chancery proceedings from the inquiry; for he was persuaded that every attempt to reform the law of the country must be very imperfect, which did not contemplate recovering a great deal of business out of courts of Equity, and restoring it to courts of Law. On that subject he differed from much of what had been said by his learned friend the member for Weymouth. He was at a loss to understand why trusts might not be as well dealt with in Common Law as in the Equity Courts. Why not let trustees sue and be sued? Why not let mortgagers sue and be sued?&#x2014;At that late hour he would not trespass further upon the House. He returned them his hearty thanks for the patience with which they had listened to him, both when he made his original statement and on the present occasion; and he would now move, "that an humble address be presented to his Majesty, respectfully requesting that his Majesty may be pleased to take such measures as may seem most expedient for the purpose of causing due inquiry to be made into the origin, progress and determination of actions in the superior Courts of Common Law in this country, and other matters connected therewith;
<image src="S2V0018P0I0469"/>
<col>923</col>
and into the state of the law regarding the transfer of real property."&#x2014;One word more. It was absolutely necessary that the greatest care should be taken in the choice of the Commissioners. Unless they were selected in the best possible way, and with reference not only to the general respectability and liberality of their characters, but to their sound and practical legal knowledge and experience, it would signify very little indeed what kind of Commission was appointed, or with what power it was invested. He did hope and trust, that a wise and beneficial course would be pursued; and that persons of peculiar qualifications, some as related to the law of real property, others as related to the law of actions, would be chosen for the purpose. He knew some persons of great zeal, and of most unexceptionable qualities and attainments&#x2014;men divested of all party feelings and considerations&#x2014;who were, he believed, perfectly disposed to sacrifice certain branches of their own practice, and, for a very moderate compensation, steadily and zealously to devote themselves to the proposed investigation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TEST AND CORPORATION ACTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00622"><member>Lord Clifden</member><membercontribution> said, he held in his hand a petition from the Catholics of Liverpool; not, however, praying for any thing for themselves, but for the repeal of those laws that injured and insulted the Protestant Dissenters. A noble friend had presented last week, a petition to the same purport from Ireland, and another to the same effect had been presented to the House of Commons, signed by seven thousand Catholics of England, among whom were the first duke and the first earl in the kingdom, five other peers and several baronets. The petition he had now to present was signed by two thousand persons, and the seven first names of those in it were those of Catholic clergymen. He troubled their lordships with this prologue, because it was the fashion to say that the Catholics were enemies to civil and religious liberty. The petitions which had lately been presented from that body were a sufficient answer to that most unjust accusation. The Catholics were now petitioning, not for themselves, but in favour of that class of persons who were thought to be hostile
<col>924</col>
to them. The Test act he considered to be most offensive to every principle of religion. It made the most sacred rite of faith a means for disregarding all faith in order to occupy offices. The noble lord mentioned an instance, as not unlikely to occur, of a man being obliged, from poverty, to fill an office, perhaps worth 150<i>l.</i> or 200<i>l.</i> a year, though he might feel conscientious scruples in qualifying himself for it. Their lordships, he supposed, all remembered the lines of Cowper, and, in repeating them, he would address himself particularly to the right rev. bench opposite:&#x2014;
<quote>"Hast thou by statute shov'd from its design</quote>
<quote>The Saviour's feast, his own blest bread and wine,</quote>
<quote>And made the symbols of atoning grace</quote>
<quote>An office-key, a picklock to a place,</quote>
<quote>That infidels may prove their title good</quote>
<quote>By an oath dipp'd in sacramental blood?</quote>
<quote>A blot that will be still a blot, in spite</quote>
<quote>Of all that grave apologists may write;</quote>
<quote>And, though a Bishop toil to cleanse the stain,</quote>
<quote>He wipes and scours the silver cup in vain."</quote>
These laws were enacted in the most disgraceful reign of that most disgraceful monarch Charles 2nd, by the violation of whose declaration at Breda sixty thousand persons were thrown into prison, five thousand of whom had perished. An eloquent writer in the "Edinburgh Review," in a late criticism of Milton's religious work, translated, he had understood, by the present bishop of Winchester, called the two kings, Charles and James, Belial and Moloch; names which they justly deserved. He hoped the day was coming, however, when those most unjust laws would be repealed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00623"><member>Lord Redesdale</member><membercontribution> thought the noble lord opposite had made a few mistakes. In the first place, Charles 2nd would have been very glad not to have passed one of those laws of which the noble lord complained; and with respect to a person qualifying himself for office, against his conscience, the fault did not lie in the law, but in the person so doing. The principle upon which those laws were made was, that property could not be safe in any country, unless those in power were interested in its support. In like manner the established church could not be safe, unless those in power were interested in its support. In this country when was that church in danger? It was at that time when the power and the army had got into the hands of those who were hostile to the church. How was it that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0470"/>
<col>925</col>
Henry 8th had been enabled to execute his plans against the monasteries? Because he had a complete control over parliament: he was, in fact, the absolute master of it. He believed the real object of all these applications to parliament, whether coming from Dissenters or Catholics, was the overthrow of the established church. The subject resolved itself into this plain question&#x2014;would their lordships have an established church? If they would, they must support it. The question was simply a political one, and upon political grounds he would oppose any alterations in the present laws.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00624"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> said, that the learned lord had stated, that the question was totally a political one, yet he seemed very ready to derive all the religious aid he possibly could. The noble lord said, that Charles 2nd was not the maker of these Tests. If Charles was not a maker of Tests, at any rate he was a great taker of them. Charles 2nd, first of all, qualified himself for the crown of Scotland by signing the Covenant. After that, he came to England, and qualified himself for the crown of this country, according to all the ceremonies of the established church, and when on his death-bed, he qualified himself for dying as a true Catholic, by receiving extreme unction. That showed the value of Tests. He did not think that all the learned lord's ingenuity could make out that the church derived any security from the Test laws against bad men. Against good men there was no need for security, and against bad men there was no security in consequence of these laws.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00625"><member>Lord Calthorpe</member><membercontribution> thought it was the obvious meaning of the oaths alluded to, that they should be taken in a proper manner, instead of which they were made a passport to office. He could scarcely conceive any thing more injurious to the character of the Church of England, than to say that its security mainly depended on acts like those. He thought the continuance of these laws as little consistent with the interests of the Church of England as they were creditable to parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EAST RETFORD DISFRANCHISEMENT<lb/> BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00627"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member> moved the order
<col>926</col>
of the day for going into a committee on this bill.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00628"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member> moved, that counsel be called in, to be heard on behalf of a petition from certain inhabitants of the borough. A short discussion took place relative to the proper course of proceeding, and whether counsel should, or should not, be called in, before the committee proceeded to examine witnesses.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00629"><member>The Speaker</member><membercontribution> called the attention of the House to the state of the question. Certain persons had approached the House with a petition which concluded in this way&#x2014;"Your petitioners represent to your honourable House that they have no representative of their own in the House, and they pray that they may be heard by their counsel, in support of the petition, against the enactment of the proposed bill." The question was, whether the House would suffer the petition to be referred to the committee, and then allow the petitioners to be heard by counsel on the petition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00630"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> shaped his motion accordingly.<lb/>
The House having resolved itself into the committee, it was moved and carried, that counsel be called in. Mr. Denman accordingly appeared at the bar. The chairman inquired for whom he appeared? Mr. Denman replied, that he appeared on behalf of the petitioners against the bill. Mr. G. Bankes moved that counsel be now heard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00631"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> having risen, counsel was ordered to withdraw. The hon. member proceeded to oppose the hearing of counsel until all the evidence had been heard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00632"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> thought there was no difference in the proceeding on this occasion and on a bill affecting private property. The custom was to call in witnesses to prove the preamble of the bill; then to hear the argument first, and the evidence after.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00633"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> was for not limiting the petitioners, as to the time when they were to be heard against the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00634"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> was only anxious to discharge his duty to the petitioners, and would be governed by the opinion of the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00635"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> argued, that the proper time for hearing counsel on the part of the petitioners, was after evidence had been heard in support of the bill which they opposed.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0471"/>
<col>927</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00636"><member>The Attorney-General</member><membercontribution> was of opinion that the petitioners' counsel ought to be heard first.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00637"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> objected to hearing counsel in this stage of the proceedings. To hear counsel before the case of the complainants was closed, appeared to hint to be manifestly absurd.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00638"><member>The Attorney-General</member><membercontribution> conceived that the way in which the House was proceeding was unconstitutional. If a member's seat were attacked, he got up, made his defence, and called his witnesses; and here they were about to disfranchise a borough without giving the petitioners a similar privilege. He claimed for these individuals the same right as that enjoyed by a member when he defended his seat. Counsel ought to be called in and heard in their defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00639"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> believed, that it had not been usual to call on any member for his defence, until the whole case against him had been gone through. All he contended for was, that the whole evidence in support of the preamble should be concluded before the evidence for the defence was begun. It would be inconvenient to hear the defence, in parts; and it would be unjust, after the defence was opened, to examine evidence against the petitioners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00640"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> contended, that there was a distinction between this case and that of a private bill. In this case they had already heard a considerable part of the evidence; indeed, all that would ever be taken on oath had been already printed and circulated. Many of the members had expressed their opinion, that that evidence would be alone sufficient to warrant the disfranchisement. The committee, therefore, would not be hearing counsel against a shadow, but against that which would probably be the best evidence that could be obtained against the borough.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00641"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> agreed with the hon. gentleman, and moved, that "Counsel should be at once called in, and heard against the preamble."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00642"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> remarked, that the petition was, that counsel might be heard against the enactments of the bill, and not against the preamble.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00643"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> said, they were then in the middle of the plaintiff's case, and he thought it would be very strange if, before the plaintiff, had sustained his case by all the evidence he could produce, he
<col>928</col>
should be set aside for the purpose of allowing the defendant to come forward in order to be heard by counsel. It would be an act of injustice even to the defendant himself; for, if such a course was pursued, it would enable the plaintiff to discover where the weak points of his evidence lay, and thus he would be enabled to take measures for strengthening it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00644"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that the learned counsel ought to be allowed to decide for himself, when it would be prudent for him to address the House. The present case was like finding a bill before a grand jury, and it would be a most unusual thing if the party accused entered on his defence before all the witnesses were heard on whose testimony the bill was either to be affirmed or dismissed. He would, however, leave it to the decision of the learned counsel, whose ability and acuteness would leave him to wave the privilege of addressing the House in the present stage of the business, if such a step should appear to him to be calculated to injure his clients.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00645"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member> moved that counsel be called in.&#x2014;Mr. Denman accordingly appeared at the bar. The Chairman informed the learned gentleman, that the committee had decided on hearing him on the subject of the disfranchisement of East Retford, and that they called on him to state the course he meant to take&#x2014;whether he wished to be heard before the evidence was adduced, or whether he was desirous that the evidence should be given first, and that he should be permitted to comment on it hereafter.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00646"><member>Mr. Denman</member><membercontribution> said, he felt himself only capable of answering the question in general terms. He was quite sure that the course which might be considered by the committee the best mode of proceeding would be that which would give him the fullest opportunity of doing his duty towards his clients. Owing to causes chiefly of an accidental nature, he had been unable to attend last Monday to object to the principle of the bill; and it was, he apprehended, highly probable that, by the time the evidence was gone through, he should be called by his avocations to another part of the country. He had no doubt that an ample opportunity would be afforded, when the evidence in support of the bill had closed, so that no enactment might be made to the prejudice of the parties concerned with-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0472"/>
<col>929</col>
out their being fully heard in their defence: but if it would not interfere with the proceedings of the committee, he hoped he might be permitted to make such general observations on the case as then occurred to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00647">Counsel having withdrawn,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00648"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that as the learned counsel was satisfied that the course the committee might follow would be conformable to the ends of justice, and as he had not stated that it was absolutely necessary to the interests of his clients that he should then address the committee, he thought it useless that counsel should be heard until after the evidence had been gone through. The committee could not take into their account any circumstances of private convenience; it was the duty of the petitioners to provide themselves with counsel who would be able to attend to their interests. It would be proper, therefore, to move "that the Counsel be informed that they would not be heard until after the evidence was concluded."<lb/>
The Chairman having notified the decision of the committee to Mr. Denman, and the preamble of the bill having been read, Mr. Richard Hannam was called in, and examined,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00649"><member>By Mr. Tennyson.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Was a solicitor. Had lived at Retford and in the neighbourhood thirty-three years. Had seen many elections in the course of passing on. Was concerned in one. It is generally understood that forty guineas is paid after the election; twenty guineas each member; that is notorious; it is not a secret; I believe it is known to every one in the town. Had been concerned in the election for, 1812. Mr. Osbaldiston and Mr. Marsh were returned. Upon that occasion I saw a great deal of election-money paid. One or two I paid myself, in 1814, for Mr. Osbaldiston. About sixty or seventy voters were paid in one day. I have in my pocket a list of the whole of the persons who were paid. It was made out at the time they were paid, by myself. It is all in my own hand-writing. It only contains a list of those living at Retford and the neighbourhood; there were some at Nottingham, and some at Manchester, of whom I know nothing. It contains a list of about seventy-five burgesses. They had borrowed some little money of me; their names are mentioned, and that money they had of me was taken off the twenty-one guineas, and so it was paid
<col>930</col>
back. Some of them had twenty guineas; and some were paid although they did not promise their votes till the morning of the election. They were paid half. Mr. Dickenson assisted me on that occasion. He was a magistrate, and since dead. Witness sat with him while the men were paid. Witness pointed out the parties, and named the sums they were to receive. This was at the Angel-inn. Witness knew Pickup; he was an election agent for one of the candidates.&#x2014;By desire of the Chairman, witness read the list of names through. He explained the distinction of whole men, half men, and quarter men. The whole men were those who received the full sum of twenty-guineas; the half men were those who had not promised their votes till the day of election, and therefore received only ten guineas; and the quarter men, who promised still later, received only five guineas. There were very few quarter men. There was no particular bargain; but the voters understood what was doing, and none of them refused the money. In the list the sums each man received were marked against his name. There were twenty-nine out-voters, and the sums opposite to their names were to be paid to them by Mr. Pickup. The name of George Hudson, now an alderman, was not in the paper. The name of Samuel Buxton was in. the paper, but he was not paid at the Angel. William Grant was paid, and was in the list. Stephen Lawrence was paid, but witness had not seen him in the lobby. Witness received several applications by letter for money from out-voters. He had six of those letters with him [a letter was selected from the number.] It came by post, and was postpaid.&#x2014;Witness then read the letters. [They were all to the same effect, being written by out-voters who claimed payment for their votes. One stated, that he had not yet received his money, which would "be very acceptable," and begged an early attention to his application. Another hoped that he should be used the same as the other voters, and suggested that his mother was entitled to her deceased husband's share. Another took the liberty of writing to witness, as he was informed that he had the power of doing something for the friends of Mr. Osbaldiston, and begged an advance of 8<i>l</i>.or 10<i>l</i>., as he was at that time in want of money]. Witness continued. He thought it probable that many of the burgesses
<image src="S2V0018P0I0473"/>
<col>931</col>
were not paid.&#x2014;He knew Thomas Butler: he came to his office to pay his rent, and witness talked to him about the election, when Thomas Butler said, "I do not care a pin about my franchise. I do not care about members, unless I can get my forty guineas." When Mr. Pickup came to him to pay the voters, he did not come in secret. Several whose names were upon the list were not paid. There was a mark or writing against their names. One had been transported, and two were dead. He believed that Mr. Marsh did not pay anything for his votes. It was impossible for him to say that the candidates did know what money was paid. Was not aware that the candidates made any contracts with the voters. He lent money to several of the voters after the election. Expected to be paid out of the money which the voters were to receive from the members. He received 900<i>l.</i> from Mr. Osbaldiston, to pay off the House bills. He was not aware that the same practice had been continued in the elections subsequent to 1812. He believed that in subsequent elections' the voters were paid, but he did not know, of his own knowledge, that any one was paid. Mr. Marsh and Mr. Osbaldiston were the candidates in 1812. Mr. Marsh never came again. He received the money from Mr. Osbaldiston through the bankers. He paid the freemen in 1814. Did not pay any in 1816, because there were actions against Mr. Osbaldiston in the court of King's-bench, and it was not thought prudent to pay any money until they were disposed of. The money he lent the voters came out of the money he received from Mr. Osbaldiston for the house-bills. The other voters were paid by Mr. Pickup.<lb/>
The chairman here asked the counsel, if he wished to ask the witness any question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00650"><member>Mr. Denman</member><membercontribution> said, he would only ask witness how many of those persons, to whom payments had been made, he knew to be alive now?&#x2014;Witness said he could not exactly say. There were only a few of them dead to his knowledge.<lb/>
Henry Pickup was then called and examined,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00651"><member>By Mr. Tennyson.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;He keeps an inn. Was employed in 1814, by Mr. Osbaldiston, to go to Retford, and pay money to the voters. Witness believed that the voters received twenty guineas a-piece at that time, but had no papers relative to the
<col>932</col>
transaction. What papers he had, he had given up to Mr. Osbaldiston. Mr. Hannam had never given witness a list of persons to whom money was to be paid; at least he recollected no such list. Witness had never paid any voters but those paid at Retford, who might be about 50; he should know the list he paid them by, if he saw it. A paper was here shown to the witness, which he said was the list in question. He had paid the voters according to that list. Mr. Hannam pointed out the parties to him who were to be paid<lb/>
Jonathan Fox was called in, and examined,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00652"><member>By Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;Was a clerk in the Retford bank in 1818 and 1819, and received 100<i>l.</i> from Mr. Crompton, for his services in the election of 1818. In 1819, a sum of 2,840<i>l.</i> was paid into the Retford bank on Mr. Crompton's account. This was paid out again in different sums; but witness could not tell to what parties, or for what purposes, as he had not the vouchers. The vouchers had been delivered to Mr. Crompton, and destroyed. Witness's impression was, that the money had been paid into the bank, and paid out for election purposes. Received the 100<i>l.</i> from Mr. Crompton as a present. Does not recollect ever to have folded up election-money in papers, and directed it to particular individuals: recollected that the 2,840<i>l.</i> had been drawn out in various sums from the East Retford bank, but could not say for what purposes, not having the vouchers: the money was chiefly, or entirely, paid by himself. His impression was, that a part of the money had been paid to tavern-keepers, and for other election purposes, but it was impossible for him to specify the amount or destination of any particular sum. He could not charge his memory with having himself ever paid any money to voters. He had every reason to believe that the whole account was an election one. There were riots in the town at and before the election. Many public-houses open, and many of the freemen constantly drunk. On some occasions the military were called out: witness thought properly, and necessarily. Mr. Crompton kept no account with the Retford bank before the election. He kept a book with the bank while he had his account there, in which the entries were made by witness. Still witness could not, after so great a lapse of time, swear to the destination of any part of the money. [On the motion of Mr.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0474"/>
<col>933</col>
D. W. Harvey, the day-book of the Retford bank, for the year 1819, was called for]. In answer to other questions the witness stated, that his impression was, that part, if not all the money paid in on Mr. Crompton's account, had been made up in parcels, and given to a person named Ledbeater; but this he could not state positively. Some parcels were made up and given to him. Ledbeater was the bellman of the town. How many parcels he got, he could not say&#x2014;whether they were one hundred, or twenty, or five, or one; but his impression was, that some parcels, containing money, were given to him. Could not state how often. Ledbeater, the bellman, had no account at the bank. If money was given to him, it must have been on some voucher from Mr. Crompton; those vouchers were not now in the bank. They had been given up to Mr. Crompton. Witness had received 100<i>l.</i> for his services in paying out the several sums of money. He could not state for what particular purpose those sums were paid. Witness was again closely pressed as to whether he had not made up several parcels of money, directed to several persons, and given them to Ledbeater, the bellman, but he persisted in saying that he could not positively charge his memory with the fact. His impression was, that some parcels were so given, but he could not state how many or to what amount. He believed the parcels were directed to burgesses. Ledbeater had since died. Did not know how Ledbeater had disposed of the parcels he got. Witness told Mr. Tennyson's solicitor to apply to Ledbeater's widow for information on that subject. Witness had made no entry of the particular items for which the sums were paid. That course would be troublesome. He could not state any other reasons for not having made the entries. There was no book kept in the bank in which those items would appear. The payments made on account of the sum of 2,840<i>l.</i>, paid in by Mr. Crompton, were entered as one sum under the head of sundries. Could not say that the accounts of any other customer who kept an account at the bank were so kept. Could not say whether the draughts made on account of the 2,840<i>l.</i> were paid in cash or notes. Witness got the 100<i>l.</i> for himself, for his trouble in paying out the several sums. A sum of 100<i>l.</i> had been paid to him on a former
<col>934</col>
occasion, for his trouble in paying out several small expenses: could not say what they were for. The amount of the whole was somewhere about 700<i>l.</i> The payments were made from June, 1819, to April 1820. The 100<i>l.</i> was paid to him for his trouble in making those payments, and nothing else. Witness had posted out the payments as one sum, under the head of sundries. If any checks or draughts were given for the payments by Mr. Crompton, they were returned to him. The names of the parties to whom the several payments were made did not appear in the posting of the account. It was posted under the head of "sundries." That was not the general way in which accounts were kept. But one other account was kept where several entries of sums were posted as one sum. If there was an error in the account of any day's account in which those payments were made, he could correct it only from memory. Witness did not make any entry of the numbers of the notes he paid on any one check. If there were any error in the daily balance, he could check it by the memorandums he had got. Those memorandums were given up to Mr. Crompton.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00653"><member>By Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;You have stated your belief that this money was paid to Ledbeater? Yes; I only stated my belief of it.&#x2014;Do you think it possible you could at any period of your life have delivered many hundred pounds in small parcels to the bellman of the town, and not have recollected it to the last day of your life? I only speak from recollection. I certainly cannot state the thing, because I only state my conviction that I think it was done; even now I cannot say most positively it was done. [The witness was informed that was no answer to the questions, and was cautioned by the chairman to answer the questions as they were put.]</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00654"><member>By Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;Give an answer to the question. I can only state to the best of my belief; I can only say I never made such a payment in a particular way, that it makes that impression upon my mind that it was paid for the purposes I have stated.&#x2014;In answer to another question, witness said parcels were made up in sums of twenty guineas. He then went on to state, in answer to other questions, that, if any of the freemen took money for their votes, he did not believe that all did. He could not say whether there were ten or five who had not taken money; but
<image src="S2V0018P0I0475"/>
<col>935</col>
there were some, he could not say how many, or who they were. He had got the 100<i>l.</i> solely for his services as clerk to Mr. Foljambe. He had never heard Mr. Foljambe state any thing about sealed packets. This money had been paid on Mr. Crompton's account, after the election of 1818. He remembered another instance where money was paid in on account of a party, after an election, who had not kept any previous account at the bank. That was paid in on account of lord Fitzwilliam. It was 500<i>l</i>. and 700<i>l</i>. on two occasions. Witness could not speak as to the dates. He supposed the money was paid with reference to election transactions, and for election purposes. He could not state the foundation of this opinion. He believed Mr. Foljambe knew more of these transactions than witness did. Never recollected any other instance of such sums as those before-named being so lumped. Could not have put the sums up in packets, without an express order.&#x2014;Assuming that your impression is well founded, who would be the person in your establishment that would make up those packets? I presume it would be myself; but I cannot remember what number of freemen there were at that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00655"><member>By Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;Supposing there were packets, you would have made them up? I presume so.&#x2014;Supposing you saw packets, and you were the person who made them up, would you have sealed them, or not? I cannot say.&#x2014;Do you think it probable?

They are all given up to Mr. Crompton.&#x2014;You say that you applied to Mr. Crompton since to lend you these vouchers? Yes.&#x2014;What was his reply? That he had received them, but having the highest reliance on the honour and fidelity of our house, that we should do nothing wrong; he had looked cursorily over the things, and on
<col>936</col>
doing so, he was satisfied it was all right, and then threw the vouchers and the book into the fire.&#x2014;Is it the practice of your bank, on paying a check of a customer, to make an entry of the manner in which you discharge the check? Perfectly so.&#x2014;If it is your custom to enter in your book the manner in which you discharge every check, where is the entry of the manner in which you satisfied that check of Mr. Crompton's? There is no other entry but that; it is posted into the regular books.&#x2014;Do you mean to say you paid a check of that magnitude without making any entry whatever in any book, of the mode in which you paid or discharged that check? I certainly should have described the mode, and the person's name; but I think there must have been some list furnished to me that would state all; that if so, that was furnished to Mr. Crompton.&#x2014;When you speak of the list, do you mean the names of persons? Yes &#x2014;You mean the names of persons who were to be the ultimate receivers of that money? Yes.&#x2014;Was the sum of money you were thus to distribute, making up the great total, made up in parcels or packets? I really cannot say.&#x2014;You have said you had a recollection that some were so? Yes.&#x2014;Do you think the whole amount was so disposed of? I really cannot say.&#x2014;You think the person who brought Mr. Crompton's check, or order, brought a list, in which were stated the names of persons who were to be the receivers of that money? Yes, I should think so.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00663"><member>By Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> and others.&#x2014;She is the widow of the late Mr. Thornton. Her husband was in the habit of employing others to pay the election-money. A memorandum-book, which stated certain payments made by him on those occasions, was produced. At the elections of 1818 or 1820, he had given 21<i>l</i>. to the voters respectively. In 1818, the sums were sent round to the voters; these gratuities were made to the burgesses generally, with the exception of the aldermen, who received none. The books which the witness brought were received in evidence. On the part of Mr. Evans, her husband had money to the amount of near 4,000<i>l.</i>, much of which was distributed among the voters. Several outvoters received a part. After specifying the sums given in 1818, the witness deposed that at that election her husband had personally disposed of the money for votes, but in 1820 he employed others for that purpose.<lb/>

Mr. Cottam, since dead, paid him with his own hand the consideration for his vote, enclosed in a letter. He was in a room at Mansfield on the occasion. It was on the part of Mr. Crompton. There were six other freemen present, some of whom got letters at the same time. In 1818, Mr. Thornton
<col>938</col>
called on him, and came afterwards in the company of a stranger, who gave him money for his vote. At the last election, he was paid by Mr. Foljambe. In 1820, he saw a company of people in an alehouse; but on applying for the election-money, he found his name was not in the list. He got money, however, afterwards. He was canvassed by Mr. Foljambe, who told him that "all would be right" if he should give his vote to sir R. Dundas. He interpreted this expression as conveying an intimation of forthcoming election-money. Sir R. Dundas was near, and must have heard what passed. Believes that most of the freemen in East Retford would expect money for their votes. He could nevertheless, not say positively that any received payment, except himself: but the practice, was a matter of notoriety, and he had heard it frequently mentioned, in public conversation. He himself got the sum of forty guineas on two occasions, and heard some of his brother burgesses speak of their having received a similar sum.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EMIGRATION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00668"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, that he had given notice of three motions for that evening. The first was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0477"/>
<col>939</col>
for a copy of the Report laid before the colonial department by lieut. colonel Cock-burn on the subject of Emigration; together with the instructions received from that department on the 26th of January, 1827; the second was, for leave to bring in a bill to revive and amend an act for regulating vessels carrying passengers to foreign parts: the last was for leave to bring in a bill to enable parishes in England, under given regulations, and for a limited period, to mortgage their poor-rates for the purpose of assisting voluntary Emigration. The last of these motions he would postpone to the 13th of March. As to the second, he had brought it forward at the desire of the colonial department; but as he understood that there was an intention to oppose it, he would postpone it to a future day, when a minister of the Crown might be present to take a part in the discussion. The sole subject, therefore, to which he should now call the attention of the House was that of Emigration from the United Kingdom; having reference to the reports of the two committees; the one in 1826, the other in 1827; which committees had examined an infinite number of individuals; and had made very copious reports, accompanied by suggestions of the course which in their opinion it was advisable to adopt. In offering his sentiments to the House upon this occasion, he begged it to be most distinctly understood, that he suggested nothing by authority of government, nor did he mean at present to propose any substantive measure. What he wished was, to call the attention of the House generally, to a subject which he was convinced was of the greatest national importance; although the thinness of the House proved to demonstration, that such was not the opinion entertained of it by the House at large. Still, however, he would not shrink from what he felt to be his duty. Whatever apathy might exist with respect to the question, at the present moment, sure he was that the day would come when the subject itself would be deemed of vital consequence. He would now, endeavour to place in as clear a light as he could, the various circumstances of the case; of the general indisposition to attend to which he should be wanting to his public duty if he did not complain. He would refer to the history of Emigration, and to the experiments that had been made with reference to it. In the year 1823, in consequence
<col>940</col>
of the state of the South of Ireland, and of the great inconvenience resulting from the superabundant population in the neighbourhood of Cork, government decided upon sending out, by way of experiment, a certain number of individuals, under the superintendance of Mr. Robinson, a Canadian gentleman, who went to Ireland for the purpose of conducting the individuals in question to the place of their destination. It was never, for a moment, pretended, that the expatriation of this small number of persons could be expected, in the slightest degree, to alleviate the evil to which he had alluded; but it was thought necessary to make an experiment for the purpose of ascertaining how far, in case the exigency should increase, the plan of Emigration could be carried into effect. In the year 1823, a body, consisting of two thousand emigrants, were sent out from the South of Ireland, under the superintendence of Mr. Robinson, and located in the North American Colonies, and the plan, he was happy to say, had entirely succeeded, Many had thought the scheme impolitic in principle, and likely to entail great sufferings upon the settlers, without producing any benefit to this country; but, as far as the first part of the doubts upon the subject reached, the result had proved that they were totally unfounded. These settlers had been as prosperous as those who had promoted the Emigration had anticipated. But when the money was to be voted, the House interfered, and said very naturally, that it was desirable that a committee should be appointed to investigate the whole subject, and that it was inconvenient that the public money should be voted without the House seeing it was clearly advantageous, and being convinced that some substantive good would arise from the proceeding. A committee was appointed in 1826, and another subsequently sat in 1827; and some of the points most essential to the right understanding and conducting of the subject of Emigration have been so well established on the authority of that committee, that they appeared settled beyond dispute. It was established by the labours of this committee, that there was a redundant population in this country. The committee of 1827 supported the doctrine of the committee appointed in 1826; which was, that there existed a redundancy of able-bodied and active labourers, with
<image src="S2V0018P0I0478"/>
<col>941</col>
their families, for whose labours there was no effective demand in either Ireland, Scotland, or England. The effect of this redundancy was, to reduce the wages of the labourer much below the proper level; and the consequence was, destitution and misery amongst great masses of the poor. This doctrine of the committee led to another principle, that the labourers for whose labours no real demand existed consumed more than they produced, and consequently added nothing to the general production of the community, but decreased the national wealth. If it was well known to be the opinion of the persons best informed upon this subject that there were labourers for whose labour no demand existed, the House must admit the main proposition, that such labourers were supported by the country, and it could not grudge any rational effort to effect their removal. He should also mention, that the committee never in any way recommended any but voluntary emigration; it set its face against all ideas of emigration by compulsion. But the House must consider, that if the distress and misery among the people were such as the evidence stated, very little persuasion, much less compulsion, would be necessary to induce the people to avail themselves of any favourable opportunity of bettering their condition. They would be glad to accept of any terms offered to them for removing from scenes of destitution at home, to those of comparative comfort in the colonies.&#x2014;He was justified in stating, that it was the opinion of the committee, that no issue of money should be made for the purpose of removing emigrants, until plans should be suggested to prevent the filling up of the vacuum produced by emigration. Unless measures were taken upon principle and system to prevent the recurrence of a redundant population, all plans and efforts to relieve the labouring classes by emigration would be frustrated. From 1822 to the present time, his attention had been turned to this subject, not only privately, but with the advantages which his official station afforded him; and although many of the opinions he had first entertained had been confirmed by further investigation and experience, he was willing to admit, that he might have adopted erroneous opinions, had they not been corrected by the labours of the committee in which he had assisted; and if the House were not disposed to allow the committee
<col>942</col>
merit for what they had done, the country was disposed to admit that they had furnished some valuable information, and had afforded new views, with reference to the condition of the country. He must consider it as admitted beyond the possibility of denial, that the expenses incurred with reference to emigration in 1823 and 1825 (putting out of the question whether the expenses were judicious or not, as to the general measure) had answered all the proposed objects and purposes, as far as concerned the condition of the parties removed. But he had heard many gross misrepresentations of the subject in Ireland, and the members of the committee had been characterized as indifferent to human suffering, and influenced by sinister motives; in short, as wholesale murderers. These representations were groundless and false. The returns and information received from North America did not present a single instance of an emigrant whose happiness had not been increased&#x2014;whose condition had not been greatly improved&#x2014;by his removal from Europe. The majority removed in 1823 and 1825 had been taken from that collision&#x2014;that ruinous competition for inferior lands&#x2014;which was incidental to a redundant population, and transported to the most fertile lands of the colonies&#x2014;lands of primeval fertility, where they had only to cut down the trees and scratch the surface, in order to produce the most abundant crops. How immense the advantage of removing the redundant and suffering population from Europe to America&#x2014;of converting them from a distressed tenantry into proprietors of rich lands, competent to supply all their wants, and to establish their immediate descendants beyond the chance of suffering what it is the lot of the great body of the poor at home to suffer&#x0021; It had been the opinion of every man, that it would be highly to the benefit of individuals, and of the community, to send off the redundant population to North America, but for the expenses of the voyage to Lower Canada: the country not being thought in a condition to incur the expenses of this voyage, or to vote supplies of public money on a demand of charity, it was not thought justifiable to incur this expense in any extended degree. But the committee appointed in 1827 avoided this difficulty, and had proved that emigration, whilst it afforded an immediate and perpetual benefit to this country, could be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0479"/>
<col>943</col>
carried on upon an extended scale, without any permanent expense, but only upon advance of the public money to the emigrants, to be lent upon a security, and under circumstances and regulations which would insure its repayment to the State.&#x2014;The committee had had an opportunity of examining eleven competent witnesses upon the subject, and they had afforded the most satisfactory evidence to prove this position. He ventured to assert, without the fear of any contradiction, that of these eleven witnesses there was not one whose credit could be impeached; they were men having ample means of possessing the most correct information upon the subject, and had no possible motive for not giving an honest and conscientious opinion. This was a valuable, a conclusive body of evidence, the weight of which could not possibly be resisted. The question had been put by the committee to these witnesses, if it were proper or feasible to hold out to the country a prospect that emigration could be effected without any ultimate expense to the public, and with a hope of the return of the money advanced to the emigrants? It was added, that no proposition could be more dangerous if there were not a sure ground on which to calculate such a result, as a proof that emigration could be carried on to any extent without incurring any expense to the State. With reference to this part of the subject it was, that certain questions were put to the witnesses by the committee, and they were so shaped as to include all points of importance with reference to the question of emigration. They were distinctly asked, what was the expense necessary to provide for the location of a family, consisting of a man, a woman, and three children, in the North American colonies? A comparison of the position of the parties, and a statement of details were given; and the result was, that in the opinion of the witnesses, 50<i>l.</i> sterling, or 66<i>l.</i> currency was enough to pay all the expenses of such an emigrant family, and to locate and establish them, so that they could go on afterwards securely&#x2014;on their own resources, and commence a repayment on this advance of money in five years. Of these 66<i>l.</i> currency, forty were to be expended in provisions; as it would be necessary that such a family, so situated should be supplied with rations for fifteen mouths, so as to put them out of all chance of want, and prevent any embarrassment
<col>944</col>
which might prevent their using their full exertions to avail themselves of the advantages set before them. In this case, they could avail themselves of their first crop.&#x2014;The next question was as to the concurrence of the witnesses in this estimate. Some persons thought the estimate too low. Not a family went out to the colony without calling another after them&#x2014;not a settler of 1823 or 1825 had been located sufficiently long to see his real situation and prospects, without writing to his friends in Europe to describe his good fortune in having emigrated, and to implore his friends to follow his example; to come out to the means of enjoying plenty, and with a certainty of avoiding want.&#x2014;The next question put by the committee to the witnesses was, whether they considered that the settlers, if they did not pay interest for seven years, would have any difficulty to pay 4<i>l.</i> per annum in money or in kind; and whether they would have power to pay off the principal at any time? The answers of the witnesses were uniform and concurrent, as to the fact of the emigrants being able to pay the sums advanced to them. They were asked, whether this would not be facilitated if it were clearly explained to the emigrants and settlers, that it was exacted from them not as a rent of land, but as a payment of interest of money lent to them at their own request, advanced in kind, and which they might repay in kind. The unanimous answer of the witnesses was in the affirmative. But the facts established by this testimony had been otherwise confirmed, and in a very remarkable manner. In 1827, his majesty's government had sent out colonel Cockburn to America; a gentleman perfectly well qualified to collect every species of information upon the subject. He was sent out in order to survey and report upon the North American colonies, with reference to their respective aptitude to receive emigrants from the mother country, and he was directed to ascertain if the majority of the settlers would be able to pay back the money advanced to them, for the purpose of enabling them to locate. Colonel Cockburn had presented an able report upon the subject, and it was for this report that he was now about to move; for he was convinced that members would derive from it information which would enable them to form clear and precise views upon the subject. Colonel Cockburn had passed
<image src="S2V0018P0I0480"/>
<col>945</col>
through a great part of the country which had been lately located, and which had consequently afforded him an opportunity of acquiring the most accurate information as to the wants, the progress, the hopes, the exertions, and the capabilities of the settlers. He had conversed with them on the spot, and had himself witnessed their condition. To his questions relative to the abilities of the settlers to repay the money advanced to them by government for their location, the answers never varied. They all said, that if they had good land, at the expiration of five years they would be able to repay at the rate of five pounds a year, provided that government would receive the repayment in produce. With respect to their ability to make the payment in money, they were less confident; and they thought that such a mode of re-payment would be necessarily uncertain, and attended with difficulties. Colonel Cockburn visited the settlers that had been located by Mr. Robinson&#x2014;the Lanark settlers; and the military settlers that had been sent out ten years ago, under circumstances different from those of other emigrants. These military settlers consisted of discharged soldiers, who were transported to the colonies, and provided for, on the condition of each individual giving up his pension. The Lanark settlers were provided for, upon a plan of their re-paying back the sums advanced, by annual instalments, to be completed in ten years. Colonel Cockburn had regretted that he had not taken down the precise words of the emigrants; and that he could consequently only give a report of the general impressions made upon his mind by what they said. Colonel Cockburn had particularly visited Perth, and Bathurst, and a third district. There were twelve statements contained in the report. In one of these statements, colonel Cockburn relates, that in the military settlement the discharged soldiers told him that when they came into the country there was scarcely one of them that possessed a penny; but that in the first year they had received from government enough to make their families comfortable, and that in five years they had each a good house and a stock of cattle. One showed four oxen, several cows, and a good live stock, for which he said he would not take 150<i>l.,</i> and in nine years he expected to increase his stock to such an extent as to be worth at least 300<i>l.</i>
<col>946</col>
sterling. Other witnesses had given precisely similar accounts of other settlements. The emigrants in every settlement had said, that at the end of five years they should be able to repay their advances, not in money but in kind. The settlers when once established were in a condition to employ other labourers, and they would soon create a market for the manufactures of this country, and thus be productive of national wealth in both hemispheres. Colonel Cockburn had made his inquiries with an intelligence and in a spirit which reflected upon him great honour. If there were those who doubted the evidence of the colonial witnesses, of colonel Cockburn and colonel Talbot,&#x2014;he would refer them to the evidence contained in letters written from settlers to their friends, some of which he had selected from many hundreds. This particular evidence was most likely to produce an effect on the minds of those who were sceptical; and, above all, it was the sort of evidence best calculated to make an impression on the minds of those who would be tempted to emigrate, if they could be satisfied that it would be advantageous to them. One passage from a letter he would read to the House as being very characteristic. The writer said to his friends in Ireland&#x2014;"Here we are, without any consideration of landlord or proctor, and with plenty of good eating and drinking. I am constantly in trouble of mind from not having you and mother with me here. I am sure you will say it was the happiest day of your life if you come." The writer then proceeded to mention some half dozen persons, whom he wished to come out to him, and concluded as follows:&#x2014;"Likewise bring my brother-in-law, Cornelius Lane, with you, and Judy Lane, and by all means don't leave Mary and Ellen behind. Come to the land of plenty, there is no such thing as want here." Such letters as that were the best argument that could be advanced to disprove Mr. O'Connel's assertion, that emigration from Ireland was a delusion. So long as letters of that description were written by emigrants, so long would there be a disposition on the part of their friends to proceed to join them. He would now entreat the attention of the House to a few observations on the state of Ireland. Whither, he asked, would the system of perpetual division of property in Ireland lead, if it did not receive some positive check? Every where
<image src="S2V0018P0I0481"/>
<col>947</col>
it was stated, that the irruption of paupers from Ireland was attended with the worst consequences to our own population. He had never heard any plausible remedy suggested for this evil, unless it was to get rid of the sub-letting system. It was in evidence before the committee, that many landlords were restrained from removing their tenants only from the apprehension that they would spread themselves over the provinces of Ireland, and commit every possible act of rapine and disorder. Could any man doubt that it would be for the interest of Ireland, if these persons could avail themselves of emigration? Could any man doubt that, under such circumstances, it was the interest of parliament to supply facilities for emigration? Of what possible advantage could the existence of those persons be in this country, and of what benefit might not their exertions be in the colonies? He was satisfied that the subject only required to be calmly considered, and well understood, for the country and parliament to be satisfied that the question of affording facilities to emigration was one which deserved the most serious attention. Further, he was convinced that no practical mode of remedying the evil which was allowed to exist could be devised, that would be so cheap. Could it be doubted that evil resulted in Ireland from persons pressing forward to become possessors of land? Those persons did not bid for land for the purpose of employing their stock or capital upon it, but from a desire to obtain the means of avoiding that starvation which they might be subjected to, if they did not obtain possession of the land. That competition, however, had a natural tendency to produce high rents. That must have been the view which the Irish gentlemen took of the question; but what was the advantage of having nominal high rents, if they were not paid? Under that system, Ireland was fast advancing to a state of Agrarian law, which tended to bring the landed proprietor down to a level with his pauper tenant. Nothing was so effectual as emigration for discouraging the system. Nothing was so common as for people to say, "Let capital flow into Ireland, and all will be well." What was the meaning of that statement? Manufacturing capital would not flow into Ireland, because there was nothing to invite it. Manufacturing capital would go where there was the greatest market, for home consumption,
<col>948</col>
where there was the greatest <i>debouchement.</i> Moreover, it would fix itself in a coal country, on account of the machinery which it employed. Capital would not go to Ireland for cheap labour, when the steam-engine brought that labour within the reach of a bridge with a high toll. Would agricultural capital flow into Ireland? Those who said so misunderstood the mode in which agriculture should be conducted. The introduction of agricultural capital would not have the effect of furnishing employment for much manual labour. If five men were at present employed in draining a field in Ireland, under an improved system of agriculture, that work might be performed by three men, which would cause a saving to the capitalist of the wages of two labourers. If ten men were now employed in thrashing, the capitalist would go to the adjoining town and purchase a thrashing machine, which would supersede the labour of most of the men. A redundancy of population operated against improvements in machinery. It was one of the misfortunes attending the state of the population, that the great principle of the wealth of this country&#x2014;namely, her machinery&#x2014;was at present in abeyance, from the impossibility which was found to exist of displacing manual labour from the channels in which it was at present employed. Some persons maintained, that it would be better to employ the redundant population in cultivating the waste lands of Ireland than to send them to the colonies. He believed that no man of any authority in the country could be found to concur in that proposition. If labour was to be applied to cultivation, let it be employed, not upon land which would barely yield a crop, but upon lands which, like those in our colonies, were known to produce the most fertile crops for an indefinite period. But if it was considered desirable to cultivate the waste lands of Ireland, why not try that scheme contemporaneously with emigration, for the purpose of striking a balance between the two plans, and seeing which was likely to be attended with the best results? In connexion with this subject, he begged to call the attention of the noble lord (J. Russell), who had given notice of a motion for a committee to inquire into the causes of the increase of crime, to a charge which had lately been delivered by the chief justice of the Common Pleas. That learned person, had
<image src="S2V0018P0I0482"/>
<col>949</col>
given it as his opinion, that the increase of crime and the lowness of wages were correlative terms. No man, he thought, could doubt that the increase of crime was the result of the lowness of wages, which induced the labouring classes to resort to other means than industry to supply their wants. All these important considerations were interwoven with the question of a redundancy of population. If the redundant portion of the population were extracted from the market, the price of labour would rise. This must be done before it would be possible to withdraw that clause of the poor-laws, which compelled parishes to find employment for the unemployed part of the population. So long as that clause existed, it would act as a bonus on population. Mr. Malthus was of opinion, that unless emigration was extensively resorted to, an alteration of the poor-laws would speedily be found necessary. The opinions held by Mr. Malthus on the subject of emigration were, he was happy to find, adopted by many persons in this country, and in the colonies themselves. Long before it was possible that either the report or the evidence of the last emigration committee could have reached Canada, he found the following resolutions had been passed at Montreal. [Here the right hon. member read some resolutions in favour of emigration.] This, he observed, confirmed the opinion expressed by the committee, as to the want of population in that district. It was worthy of remark, that we had in Canada 111 millions of acres of land capable of cultivation, while in Great Britain the cultivated land amounted to no more than 77 millions of acres; and that, while in Canada the population amounted to no more than one person for each 190 acres, we had in England 57 persons to each 190 acres. He had been informed by Mr. Gallatin, the late American minister, that when he first settled in the United States, he placed himself at the very extreme limit of cultivation, that was to say, upon the borders of the forests, which had, up to that time, been uninhabited; but that, if a line were now to be drawn, it would be found that a tract of country, extending more than 800 miles behind him, had since been brought into cultivation. If the same course were adopted in our colonies&#x2014;if similar exertions were made&#x2014;he had no doubt that they would be productive of the like effects. He questioned whether any policy would be more effective than
<col>950</col>
that of giving to some of our colonies a population adequate to their cultivation; and this we might do, by sending out the superabundant population of the sister country. This would at once benefit the individuals and prevent the desperate evils caused by the sub-letting of land in that country. He thought, also, if the practice of letting land adopted in this country was extended to Ireland, it would tend to prevent the too great increase of the population. He looked more to the increased intelligence and information which had been acquired by Irish proprietors upon this subject than to any other remedy. Much, however, might be expected from a judicious plan of emigration. If they looked to the Cape, they would find, from the evidence of Mr. Pringle that the distresses of the Colony were attributed to the want of labouring persons, and that merchants had even volunteered to send over persons at their own cost. With respect to New South Wales the case was different. That colony was already capable of furnishing products which had an exchangeable value, not only with the mother country, but in various parts of the Eastern Archipelago. She therefore held out great temptations, notwithstanding the extreme difference, in point of distance, between her and the other colonies.&#x2014;Upon a review of all the circumstances, he was bound to come to the conclusion, not only that the plan of relieving the country by encouraging colonization was beneficial in a direct way, but that it was impossible to lay out capital with a better prospect of ensuring a fair return, than by sending our supernumerary population to Canada. In fact, many parishes were so well aware of this, that they would willingly undertake the expense of sending their own poor, under a conviction that in the present state, and with the peculiar wants of the colony, they could not expect any thing more profitable than an export of population. Nor was it in the home parishes alone that this truth was felt and acknowledged. In the colonies themselves the inhabitants would be most willing to pay the expense of conveyance, if the individuals were articled to them as servants on going out; so great was the demand for labour of all kinds in those places. It was impossible for him to enter into those minute details before the House which would be best inquired into in the committee; but he would say, that those facts were numerous and con-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0483"/>
<col>951</col>
clusive, and that the evidence of colonel Talbot went to confirm that of the witnesses examined before the committee, which were all in favour of carrying a national system of emigration, or rather of colonization, into effect, at as small an expense as possible. He had stated these facts and opinions to the House, because he felt that they referred to a subject of great importance, and upon which no legislative measure ought to be adopted without the sanction and support of public opinion. He had encountered much scepticism in the course of these proceedings. It was natural that he should have done so, and therefore he did not complain. Nothing was more common, or more easy, than to charge those plans with being visionary which were still to be tried. But, whatever charges might be brought against the plan which he was anxious to recommend, nothing could be more conclusive than the evidence by which its practicability was established. The more he saw of the progress of public opinion, the more he was convinced of the increasing disposition to look at this subject with an impartial eye; and though, perhaps, they were not yet prepared to go to the full extent of his wishes, the day, he believed, was not far distant when the country would approach the question, and deal with it upon those sound principles which alone could ensure success to the experiment. It was not improbable that he, like many others to whom the task of suggesting new measures was assigned by the circumstances of the times, might have to look forward to some future period for that strong support which seldom attended the early stages of any improvement; if so, it would be his duty to submit with patience, but he still should have the consolation of thinking, that sooner or later the importance of the facts he had been instrumental in collecting, would be acknowledged by the public voice.&#x2014;Having thus dismissed the general subject, he now came to the Passengers' act, of which he had given notice for that day. It was with regret he had heard that an hon. friend of his had expressed an intention to oppose it. He would admit that this act was objectionable, as its effect was, to check emigration; but still he would have preferred the middle course, of qualifying and revising, instead of repealing it. The necessity of some such measure was to be inferred from the evidence which government
<col>952</col>
had received on the subject. There was a despatch from sir Howard Douglas, which represented the starving and distressed condition in which many of the emigrants had arrived at Halifax. Such was the effect of leaving unfortunate passengers to the consideration of those who speculated in their transport. No one, he thought, who looked at the subject without prejudice would leave the ignorant persons who crowded to the coasts of Ireland, either at the mercy of the captains with whom they sailed, or to their own unassisted discretion in providing for the voyage. The most calamitous results might be expected in either case; nay, had actually resulted from the operation of the present measure. The despatch of sir James Kemp, also from Halifax, alluded to the same distress and misery which was noticed in that of sir H. Douglas. It was from a knowledge of these facts, that he thought the whole bill ought to be revived, under certain modifications. The object of that modification would be, to establish a minimum of space and of food, below which the emigrant should not be supplied. The utility of such a rule was proved, not merely by the disadvantages which had arisen from its neglect, but by the positive advantage with which its adoption was attended. Of the two thousand individuals who were taken from Ireland in 1825, when this law was in force, the health and comfort of the emigrants was properly attended to. There were no deaths on the voyage, no sickness, nor was there a single instance of crime. From the papers on the table it appeared, that the amount of misery inflicted upon passengers by the want of some positive regulation with respect to the amount of space and of food, was greater than might be expected. It was to prevent the recurrence of such misery, that he was desirous to introduce a modified bill, asking only for the establishment of a minimum with respect to these two important points. The United States had already passed a measure, to prevent the introduction of emigrants into that country, except under certain regulations. Our own colonies would feel the benefit of so slight a regulation as that which he proposed; and, above all, the emigrants themselves would feel it, and the opinion of the country would be more favourably disposed, in consequence of it, to the general measure from which he anticipated so much good. The emigration which he contemplated was essentially
<image src="S2V0018P0I0484"/>
<col>953</col>
voluntary. Founded upon that principle, it would be attended with great advantage, both as respected the colonies and the mother country. Without it the measure must necessarily fall to the ground. He would own, that unless it was generally felt to be of vital importance, unless it had the public opinion strongly expressed in its favour, it would be unsafe for any government to meddle with a matter of so much delicacy. But he trusted that the attention of the House and of the country would not only be vigorously applied to the subject, but would be strongly influenced by the recommendations in which their committees had concurred. The right hon. gentleman concluded by moving for a "copy of the report of lieutenant colonel Cockburn, laid before the Colonial Department, on the subject of Emigration; together with the Instructions received from that Department on the 26th January 1827."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00669"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, that the repayment of any sum of money advanced to the emigrants would be much easier than was generally anticipated. To prove his assertion he referred to the evidence given by Mr. Benton before the Emigration Committee. He was convinced that, if the emigration was conducted upon a wise and suitable plan, and if the settlers could be placed, not at a distance from the cultivated part of the Canadas, but upon the confines of civilization; so as to be enabled, after planting their own land, to earn some remuneration by labouring for others, it would require no assistance from this country to support the settler after he had once been sent out. Besides, even if he could support himself, the Legislative Assembly of Canada had declared itself willing to give him assistance. If government would either give up part of the Crown lands, or should part with the supremacy over them, the assembly would provide for the support of every indigent person who might be sent over into that province. He believed there was greater difficulty experienced in preventing settlers from going from Canada into the United States, than in providing for them in that colony. One of the greatest objections to emigration to Canada was the tenure under which land was held in that colony. A law was passed several years ago to remove those objections, but it had never been carried into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00670"><member>Mr. James Grattan</member><membercontribution> said, he looked at the question of emigration purely as one
<col>954</col>
of money. There were two ways in which it might be carried into execution&#x2014;either by the grant of a million of the public money, or by sums advanced by individual speculation. The right hon. gentleman had told them, that if the public advanced the money, it should not be considered as so much money lost, but simply as a loan. He would admit that if we were allowed to take corn from the Canadas in payment of our advances, we might not lose our money; but he had yet to learn how far that would be permitted. With respect to individual speculation, he had not yet heard of any one Irish proprietor who had offered to advance 50<i>l.</i> a head for the removal of his tenantry. As far as he could learn, the feeling of the Irish proprietors was, that their money, if they must raise a sum by assessment among themselves, would be much better expended upon local improvements, than upon objects which took their money to a distant country, and removed to a very distant time all hopes of being remunerated for the outlay of it. It was easy to talk of expending a million of the public money on such objects: but were we bound to exhaust our finances, and to export our population to bring the Canadas into a state of cultivation? The great difficulty, it appeared, was to keep the emigrants, when once they got to Canada, from quitting it for the United States; and certainly we did not want an influx of the Irish population to increase their strength and their hostility towards England. It was proposed, too, that the million of money should be distributed by a public board; and individuals had gone so far as to form the emigrants into different classes for exportation. The first class to be exported consisted of those who had teen ejected from their farms; the second, of those who were under process of ejectment; and the third, of those whom the board might select from the population at large. Now, he must say, that such a plan appeared to him to be most censurable. The evil under which Ireland now suffered was the movement of the tenantry, and this plan was calculated to aggravate it; for as soon as an Irish proprietor could ascertain that it was to be carried into effect, he would write to his agent to serve writs of ejectment on his tenantry, in order that they might be qualified for selection by the Board of Emigration. If the right hon. gentleman could force the gentry of Ire-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0485"/>
<col>955</col>
land to attend to the state of their property in that country, and could induce them not to let their estates be overpeopled, much of the evil under which Ireland now laboured might be relieved without having recourse to any organized system of emigration at the expense of the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00671"><member>Colonel Davies</member><membercontribution> said, he had no sanguine expectations of success from the scheme which the right hon. gentleman had propounded to the House. In order to make such a scheme of advantage to England, it must be attended not only with an alteration of the whole system of our Poor-laws, but with some measure which would prevent the influx of such numbers of Irish paupers as were daily finding their way over into England. He was decidedly of opinion, that there was little chance of any repayment of the money advanced to the emigrants for the purpose of carrying them abroad.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00672"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> agreed, that the subject demanded their most serious attention. He did not, however, think that the House was furnished at present with the means of forming a correct judgment on the details of the plan. There was no person who was more convinced of its importance than he was; for he thought it the best, and, indeed, the only way of relieving the distresses of both England and Ireland; and he considered it as much an English as an Irish question, and one of as great importance as any taken up by the leading politicians of the day, whether with regard to the freedom of trade, the education of the people, or Catholic emancipation. He thought the right hon. gentleman deserved the highest credit for the perseverance and ability with which he had called the attention of the House to the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00673"><member>Mr. Slaney</member><membercontribution> agreed entirely with the hon. baronet, that this was by no means an Irish question, but one as closely connected with the welfare and happiness of England as any that could occupy the attention of parliament. The subject was one of great importance, even if taken in no other view than that it would give a check to the progress of misery, the termination of which no one could foresee. As to the Poor-laws of England, it would be his duty to bring this matter shortly before the House, and he would therefore abstain from making any observation upon it. He only wished now to thank the
<col>956</col>
right hon. member for the labour he had bestowed, and the attention he had given, to a subject of such vital importance. He advised hon. members to read the report of the Emigration-committee, before they found fault with its recommendations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00674"><member>Mr. Leycester</member><membercontribution> avowed himself an enemy to emigration, which appeared to him to be a system of gross impolicy, and might, indeed, be termed a system of statistical suicide. If he were asked what was to be done with a superabundant population, he would answer, employ them in improving and cultivating the waste lands, which would give employment to thousands. Such cultivation was certainly impeded by barriers of no ordinary difficulty; namely, the poor-laws, tithes, and taxes; but remove them, and the advantages would be of easy attainment. He had himself paid no less than 6,000<i>l.</i> for reclaiming a hundred acres of waste land, and it would not have cost him more than half that sum if it had not gone into his majesty's Exchequer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00675"><member>Mr. Benett</member><membercontribution> said, it was clear from the report on emigration, that whatever vacuum we might make would be filled up as rapidly as it was made. Under these circumstances, he thought no sum of money would effect the proposed object. He would not, however, object to the remedy proposed without stating another. The right hon. gentleman had said, that the land in this country and in Ireland was exhausted. That could not be true; for the bogs of Ireland had never been touched with the plough. The real embargo on cultivation was to be found in the amount of taxes and tithes; in the uncertainty in the price of corn, and in the value of money. If these evils were removed, neither England nor Ireland would be found to have a surplus population. Men, when unemployed, had lately been spoken of as a sort of mischievous animal of which the country must be rid at any rate, and as if no means would be too great to effect such a riddance. Every other domestic animal had its price; but man seemed to be considered so far inferior to them, that instead of claiming a price we offered one to get him away. Our colonists, wiser than ourselves, were willing to do what they could to obtain what we thus foolishly rejected. Was it not possible, therefore, for us to make a profit of the concern? Could we not sell the unfortunate wild Irish who were now proposed to be re-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0486"/>
<col>957</col>
moved at our expense? We might make money by such a measure; and in these days of economy such a consideration ought not to be neglected. The poor wretches themselves would not suffer more in being sold to the colonies, than they would in being banished from their native land. He had an objection to allowing the overseers to superintend the emigration from their respective parishes, as he conceived that much oppression and distress would result from such a plan. By voluntary emigration they would get rid of the valuable and enterprising members of society, and the evil which was said to afflict this country and Ireland would remain undiminished. The want of employment was the great evil, and that could be best remedied by removing the obstacles which stood in the way of the employment of the poor, instead of resorting to this comparatively useless measure of emigration. From time to time there was an immense number of men sentenced to seven years transportation. These men were confined for three or four years on board the hulks, and then, after their education has been perfected, they were again let loose upon the public. Why not send these men abroad at once for seven years? He, as a magistrate, was well aware of the evil created by allowing them to return back to society: they generally resorted to their old habits, and when next taken were hanged. By getting rid of that class of persons a real good would be effected. They would leave a land where their character was forfeited for ever, and would be introduced to a new country, where they might in time become worthy members of society. He was for getting rid of the bad, and for keeping the good. He should be glad to see the hon. member's plan confined to an emigration of those individuals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00676"><member>Colonel Wood</member><membercontribution> said, there were more difficulties opposed to the plan recommended by the hon. member for Wiltshire, than to that introduced by his right hon. friend. If the corn-laws, the currency, and all those other difficulties, were disposed of, then they might think of cultivating the waste lands of Ireland, in order to give employment to the lower orders. It was, however, the opinion of many, and especially of those who were advocates for the principles of free trade, that too much land was already under the plough; and sure he was, that in England
<col>958</col>
the tillage of waste lands had been carried to the utmost extent that could be profitable. If the hon. member could introduce a higher degree of cultivation, it would only tend to the increase of the evil. He entirely agreed with what had fallen from the hon. baronet, the member for Westminster, and only regretted that his speech was not heard in a more crowded House. He perfectly coincided with him that there was no question, not excepting the Catholic question, or that of free trade, equal in importance to the one now under discussion. He agreed that it was as much an English as an Irish question. In bringing it forward, the most persevering attention and indefatigable industry had been manifested by his right hon. friend. During the last session he had been incessantly engaged in labours connected with it, and he had succeeded in eliciting a most important body of evidence, which it would be well for hon. members to weigh thoroughly before they approached the consideration of the question at large. He considered the proposed plan perfectly practicable as far as it regarded England, and was convinced that it would be highly advantageous to the lower orders. The mal-administration of the poor-laws in some parts of the country had reduced the price of labour to a level degrading to humanity. He would mention a fact illustrative of the degraded state to which the poor had been thus reduced. It occurred in the parish of Harrow. The peasantry in that part of the country were actually put up to auction. A single man generally fetched 5<i>s.</i> a week; a married man, with his wife, brought 7<i>s.</i>; and for a married man with a family something higher was given. This auction took place regularly every week, and the labourers were knocked down to the highest bidders. The practice had been abolished through the exertions of the magistrates, but it afforded a strong proof of the degraded condition to which the poor-laws had reduced the English peasantry. Emigration would relieve the country in a great degree, as its immediate effect would be a rise in the price of labour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00677"><member>Mr. John Smith</member><membercontribution>, as a member of the Emigration-committee, felt it to be his duty to bear testimony to the assiduity and zeal displayed by the right hon. gentleman. Certain calculations connected with the right hon. gentleman's plan might
<image src="S2V0018P0I0487"/>
<col>959</col>
not be accurate, but he considered the principle of the plan admirable, and he believed it was the only one calculated to assist the poor of this country and of Ireland. Reference had been made to himself, as he had taken a share in the distribution of the money subscribed for the relief of the manufacturers who had been involved in great distress; and he would therefore allude to a circumstance, as bearing upon the question. The committee had been solicited to send relief for a thousand families in Glasgow, and it was distinctly proved before them, that the whole amount of food consumed in one year by any one of those distressed individuals, was not worth more in money than from 25<i>s.</i> to 28<i>s.</i> It was distinctly proved that such was the miserable sustenance furnished to a human being in the course of the twelve months. He would leave the House to imagine what must be the condition of the poor in the western parts of this country, where the emigration of the Irish was incessant. The Irish, who came over in shoals, had been accustomed at home to subsist upon a very small quantity of food: they offered their labour at the lowest possible price, and they thus threw the Scotch and English labourers out of the market. Some attempt should be made to put a stop to this excessive nuisance. There were few counties in England exempt from its operation. It was even felt in Sussex, a county the most distant from Ireland, and where it might be supposed these poor wretches would not find their way. The only mode of preventing this emigration from Ireland was, to find employment for the peasantry at home. That was the only mode of putting an end to the irruptions of the Irish peasantry. English capital would not go to Ireland, though, to his certain knowledge, six per cent had been offered for it. There were large quantities unemployed at present, and yet no man would lend money at six per cent upon land in Ireland, because he was afraid that the principal, not to mention the interest, would never be repaid. He had not the least doubt but if Ireland were pacified by the restoration of her rights, that three months would not elapse after the passing of the measure, before English capital would find its way into that country, and sufficient employment be afforded to the population. There was no other
<col>960</col>
mode on earth by which they could improve the condition of the poor of that country. So long as emancipation should be denied, so long would the population of Ireland continue wretched and degraded. So long as it was refused, her peasantry would come over in shoals, and crowd our shores with misery and wretchedness, being assured that they could not encounter greater hardships here than they already endured at home. For himself, he approved of the principle of emigration. The plan proposed by the right hon. gentleman was well worthy of their serious attention. In a part of the country where he resided, there were eighty-four labourers in one parish, not one of whom was not paid a portion of his subsistence out of the parish funds. An excellent Quaker gentleman, Mr. W. Allen, with whom he was acquainted, having visited that parish, described it, to use his own expression, as in a state of "spiritual darkness," and added, that it had no regular clergyman. Indeed, the inhabitants laboured under all kinds of destitution. Mr. Allen established a school there, and at his request, he (Mr. J. Smith) took a farm in the parish, and built upon it seven cottages, to each of which he annexed an acre and a quarter of land. The cottages were erected at convenient distances, and the tenant holding the cottage was to pay for the ground attached to it. He had not had to complain of a single defaulting tenant amongst them. He might be accused of encouraging, in this instance, the further increase of the already too great population of the country. Such was not the case. The moral and industrious habits which enabled these men to cultivate this small quantity of land would also induce them to prevent their children from marrying at seventeen or eighteen, and thus perpetuating in them that misery which had been before entailed upon themselves. He was confident that his tenants would not permit them to marry unless they could reckon upon a sufficiency for their support. If other gentlemen were to try the experiment, they would find it productive of considerable benefit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00678"><member>Mr. W. Whitmore</member><membercontribution> said, there could be no doubt but it would be a great advantage to send the unemployed Irish to the colonies. At the same time he could not help thinking that insuperable difficulties
<image src="S2V0018P0I0488"/>
<col>961</col>
opposed the carrying the measure of emigration into effect: the first lay in preventing the filling up of the vacuum occasioned by the abstraction of the emigrants: the next consisted in the large sums of money that would be required to carry into effect any extensive plan of emigration. He should be glad to see those difficulties overcome; but at present they appeared to him insuperable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00679"><member>Sir J. Graham</member><membercontribution> asked the Secretary for the Colonies, whether it really was the intention of government to re-introduce the Passengers' act, after the report of the last session?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00680"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, he felt, in common with his right hon. friend, that no matter required earlier attention than the revival of certain provisions of the Passengers' act. If the hon. baronet had seen all the reports from New Brunswick and the other colonies, to which there was a considerable emigration last year, he would be satisfied of the propriety of such a course. Those who arrived brought with them contagious disorders of the worst description: the gaol fever devastated whole townships, to the destruction, in some instances, of not less than one-tenth of the population. The interests of humanity loudly demanded that immediate measures should be taken to secure for the passengers in those vessels a sufficient space, and a due attention to their comforts and accommodation. There were many provisions in the old act of an objectionable nature, and which government did not propose to revive; but no time should be lost in reviving the material provisions of the act, as the season was fast approaching when vessels with passengers would be clearing for the Colonies and North America. He would not enter then upon the discussion of the subject immediately before the House, nor examine whether there existed an excess of population beyond that for which employment could be found. But, although that was an evil in itself, there were other evils and other considerations which should be attended to. One of the greatest of these&#x2014;an evil not impossible in any country, and not improbable in this&#x2014;was, that there might exist a great emigration from amongst the population without a corresponding emigration of capital; and thus they would be only transferring a portion of the mischief existing to other quarters of the world.
<col>962</col>
If individuals were encouraged to emigrate, they should be enabled to employ themselves profitably in the new countries to which they were sent; and the capital at present lying idle in this country might probably be advantageously put in requisition for that purpose.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00682"><member>Mr. W. Horton</member> moved for leave to bring in a bill "to regulate the conveyance of Passengers in Merchant Vessels to Foreign Parts."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00683"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that after a full deliberation the Emigration Committee had recommended the repeal of the act which it was now proposed to revive, on the ground that it had prevented the emigration of thousands to America. It increased the expense, and added to the difficulty of conveying passengers thither. Before the repeal of this act for the regulation of passage vessels, disease as contagious and distress as great, were wafted to the shores of America, as subsequently. These facts would be found detailed in the report of the Emigration committee. He saw no reason why this act should be revived; but if it was the intention of government to introduce a bill, as this certainly would be, in contradiction to the recommendation of the Emigration committee, he trusted time would be allowed to examine into and consider the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00684"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> confessed he was unable to understand the nature of those pure abstract principles which were to prevent them from interfering where the interests of humanity were at stake. He could not conceive the meaning of those general principles which were never to bend to circumstances. During the short time that he had been in his present office, a variety of documents had reached him upon the matter, and amongst others a letter from sir J. Kempt, who commanded on the Halifax station. He wrote, that during the last season the ship "James" arrived there from Ireland, with emigrants. She sailed with a hundred and sixty on board, of whom five died on the passage, and thirty-five were left at Newfoundland, being unable to proceed. The remaining one hundred and twenty, with the crew, arrived at Halifax, labouring under typhus fever. The population of Halifax amounted to seven thousand, and in the lapse of ten months eight hundred had fallen victims

<col>963</col>
to the contagion. Care ought to be taken to prevent the crowding of these poor people into a smaller space than was compatible with their health and comfort. All he asked for was, not that unnecessary regulations should be introduced, which must, necessarily, have the effect of throwing obstacles in the way of the improvement of the colony, but that care should be taken to provide sufficient quarters and sufficient diet, so as to prevent the introduction of those dangerous fevers which were often fatal to the parties themselves, to those employed in navigating ships carrying emigrants, and to the persons amongst whom the emigrants went to reside. This might be avoided by adopting precautions; and he might be permitted to observe that regulations were enforced in various of the British colonies that were much more strict than any that this law would impose. With respect to the way in which those poor people were sent out of Ireland, it was in many instances most lamentable. The law had no power to interfere, and the consequences were horrible. The passengers, in a state of despair, took possession of the vessel, and a melancholy shipwreck was the consequence. He, therefore, thought it necessary to introduce some measure to rectify this evil. Let a bill be introduced as soon as possible, and when printed, if any superfluous regulations appeared in it, let them be withdrawn; but some new regulations were absolutely indispensable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00685"><member>Mr. Stanley</member><membercontribution> said, that if he had not been one of those who recommended the repeal of these regulations, he would not have addressed the House. Certainly, on the evidence before the committee, they had resolved to do away with all regulations respecting passengers. He was willing to take his share of the responsibility of having been a party to this rather hasty decision; but, at the same time, on the evidence before the committee, he did not see how they could avoid the conclusion to which they had come. If great practical evils, however, were found to result from the removal of the regulations, he had no objection to the introduction of a modified bill for their revival. He had lately had an opportunity of seeing the correspondence to which his right hon. friend had alluded. Having attentively read through these details, he was satisfied that some restrictions were necessary to restrain the excessive cupidity of the adventurers,
<col>964</col>
who speculated in passage vessels. To illustrate that necessity, he would ask why there should be regulations with respect to luggage and passengers in and upon stage-coaches? Such regulations were rendered necessary for the safety and comfort of those who travelled. Now, if it was deemed proper to have regulations of a restrictive nature with respect to stagecoaches, which travelled every day, how much more necessary was it to apply some settled rules to the mode of taking out emigrants. The ships selected for this purpose were old vessels, specially taken up for the occasion, and never used again. They were crammed with human beings, badly provided with necessaries, and the consequences were disease and death. The persons who carried on this system were left to play the game over and over again, with new victims. He remembered in one of the letters an expression of a gallant officer, who said that, though he had seen many slave ships on their arrival, with their human cargoes, he had never seen any so loathsome and disgusting as one of these passage vessels which he had seen arrive from Ireland. From reflection, and the perusal of these papers, he must retract the opinion he had formed upon this subject; and though he remained a warm advocate of the general principles of free trade, he thought a special case of exception had been made out in this instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00686"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> said, he had no wish to oppose this measure, if sufficient time were given for obtaining information from Ireland, and from other parts interested in the question. He considered it very unwise that they should legislate without having the requisite information to proceed upon. Certainly, if emigration was good for any thing, it should be made as cheap as possible. If emigration from Ireland to England could be effected at 10<i>s.</i> a head, he must contend, that the rate should be reduced from those countries to other parts of the world. With respect to the prevalence of disease, the right hon. gentlemen opposite had proved nothing in what they had said; because typhus fever, in its incipient state, though one person only had the seeds of it in his system, might spread the infection throughout a large crew.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00687"><member>Mr. Robinson</member><membercontribution> said, that, from his connexion with the colonies, such a multitude of papers had come under his observation,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0490"/>
<col>965</col>
with reference to this subject, that he had no doubt as to the mischievous consequences of allowing passengers to go from Ireland and Scotland without restrictions. It seemed to him absolutely necessary to repeal the act of last session. However desirable it might be to encourage emigration from Ireland and Scotland, he was convinced that the act of last session was productive of consequences appalling to humanity, and mischievous to the people amongst whom the emigrants went to settle. He would read an extract from a colonial paper, containing a case of a very distressing nature. The paper was published at St. John's, Newfoundland, on the 30th of August last:&#x2014;"We happened, on Wednesday last, to go on board a vessel with emigrants from the west of Ireland, bound to Halifax; it contained one hundred and sixty-four passengers. The captain stated, that they had had no sickness on board but what arose from hunger, and the peculiar situation of one or two of the people. The passengers found provisions for themselves, and by the time they had half finished the voyage, their stock was nearly exhausted. It then became necessary to draw on the stores of the ship, and indications followed of a very alarming character. A short time before the ship made land, such was the desperation to which these wretched people were driven, that they absolutely insisted upon having bread or blood." Now, was there any black slavery equal to this; and could it be a matter of surprise, if, under such circumstances, pestilence and famine put an end to the existence of those unfortunate people? But such were the consequences of not extending that useful act, which had been frequently alluded to, to all the colonies, which would prevent the recurrence of such wretchedness. He could vouch for it, that such was the ignorance of those unfortunate individuals who were stimulated to leave their native country, in consequence of that heartrending distress, of which the House had heard so much, that they knew not how, when going out, to provide for themselves; and they were left at the mercy, and subjected to the cupidity of the owners of vessels, who extorted the largest freight they possibly could from those wretched creatures. He, therefore, implored the House to give their support to the measure recommended to them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00692"><member>By Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution>, and others.&#x2014;Had been a burgess of East Retford for thirty years. Had witnessed many elections. At some of the elections did not receive a farthing. Could not say any thing about any one else. Received no money at the election when Mr. Osbaldiston and Mr. Marsh were candidates, because they would not give him any. He was promised money by an attorney (Mr. Hannam); but he forgot to give him the money. Mr. Hannam told him to call upon him and he would give him ten guineas; but he did not perform his promise. Hard as this was upon him, he was obliged to bear it. At the election in 1818, he received twenty pounds or guineas. He would speak the truth; but he could not tell who gave it him. It was sent to me as a present, in a letter. He had some conversation with Mr. Foljambe. Mr. Foljambe came in and sat down by him, and said, "all should be right." Did not know what Mr. Foljambe meant by it. Had often heard the expression used at Retford, but never knew what it meant. Had said upon the committee, "If they win, they expect the same as a labouring man that goes to his day's work, and that the practice had been continued for twenty years." Might have said before the committee that the voters seldom got any thing but black-looks, if they were on the losing side; and that the meaning of a burgess at Retford "having lost his election," was, that he had got nought for voting.</membercontribution></p>

him any thing, nor never gave him any thing, nor he never received any thing. Did not know if he had ever received money from Mr. Mason. Had voted in the interest of the duke of Newcastle. Mr. Mason was the agent of the duke of Newcastle. Could not say he ever received any money from him for election purposes, from him himself, to his knowledge. He received a present when he voted in the interest of the duke of Newcastle. Could not say from whom. Recollected the election at which Mr. Crompton was returned. Had a present sent him after that election. Could not say if it was 20<i>l.,</i> 30<i>l.,</i> or 40<i>l.</i> Could not say if it was more than 20<i>l.</i> Did receive a present at Mr. Osbaldiston's election, but did not know from whom. A gentleman left it at his House. He had never seen that gentleman before in his life-time. He did not know what he received the money for. "He axed me my name, and gave it into my hand, and said not a word." He could not say how often that gentleman called before he found witness at home.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00695"><member>By Mr. Fergusson.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;He always received these presents about the time of elections. Never received such things at any other times. The present he received was in bank-notes. Could not say exactly what he did with them. He took care of them. He put them into <i>practice.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00696"><member>By Mr. Fergusson.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Did you count them before you put them into <i>practice</i>?&#x2014;The witness did not answer.&#x2014;Did you tell them, or reckon them, in order to see how many there were?&#x2014;The witness still remained silent, and the Chairman said he must again caution him against the answers, or rather no answers, which he gave.&#x2014;Could not say how many there were. Knew how many there were when he received them.<lb/>
The frequent repetition of this question to the witness failed to elicit any distinct answer, whether he had or had not counted the notes. He could not name any candidate for East Retford who had not given money to him, excepting Mr. Marsh. Had once received payment for an election when he was in London: a sum of money had been put into his hand in the common street; he could not tell how much.&#x2014;Have you had any conversation with alderman Parker, of Retford, since you came to London?&#x2014;Just as we passed on. He said "good morning;" and I said "good

<p id="S2V0018P0-00697"><member>R. Hodgkinson</member><membercontribution> was called in, and examined.&#x2014;Had not voted at any election but the last for twenty-one years.

<p id="S2V0018P0-00698"><member>E. C. Brown</member><membercontribution> was called in, and examined. He was town-clerk of Retford. He was an attorney.&#x2014;Have you received any election money?&#x2014;I appeal to the Chair whether I am bound to answer that question or not.<lb/>
The witness was directed to withdraw.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00699"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> observed, that other witnesses had been obliged to answer similar questions, and he did not conceive why the last witness should be permitted to refuse.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00700"><member>The Attorney-General.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;The witness was not in law bound to answer any question which might criminate himself. The other witnesses who had answered had answered voluntarily.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00701"><member>Sir R. Wilson</member><membercontribution> said, that the House might be disposed to take any statement as to the practice of the law from the learned gentleman, but they would not take his authority as to what was the practice of parliament. That practice was to oblige witnesses to answer every question put to them. Without that power, their privileges, in prosecuting any inquiry of this kind, were worth nothing. If the witnesses were allowed to go from their bar without being compelled to answer the questions put to them, they ought to go in a body, with their chairman at their head, and apologise to the individual whom they had committed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00702"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> said, if the House permitted the witness to depart without answering the question, they would act most unconstitutionally. What would be the effect of such a course, but to give perfect impunity to every man who might be called before them, who wished to suppress the truth? He was surprised the Attorney-general should have shown himself so ignorant of the law of parliament. But his ignorance was the least to be considered. He had shown a contempt for that law in the opinion he had given. Was it to be supposed that in asking any questions from a witness, they would not extend to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0492"/>
<col>969</col>
him a full protection from the consequences which in other places would follow from an admission criminating himself? It was the well-known practice of the House to do so, and it would abandon its duty if it did not compel every witness to answer all the questions put to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00703"><member>Sir C. Burrell</member><membercontribution> observed, that the law of parliament, as he understood it, was, that every witness was protected from the consequences which might otherwise follow from his speaking the truth before the House, but that he was committed only for prevarication, or for refusing to answer. He therefore considered that the witness was bound to answer any question put to him, to the best of his knowledge; but as some witnesses might not be aware of the protection which the House gave to those who were called before it, he would move, that the chairman be instructed to state to the witness, that in any evidence he gave before that House, he should be protected as far as he spoke the truth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00704"><member>The Attorney-General</member><membercontribution> said, he rose for the purpose of repelling the coarse, unfounded, and wanton, attack which had been made upon him by the hon. member for Staffordshire. The hon. member had charged him with ignorance of the law on this question, and had added that his ignorance was the least of it. How was the hon. member warranted in making such a wanton attack on him? Had he said that if they compelled the witness to answer any questions put to him, they were not bound to cast round him the mantle of their protection, as to the consequence of his answers? But the hon. member had implied that something of this kind was meant by him, and had taxed him with ignorance of the law of parliament. He had been longer in parliament than the hon. member, and knew the practice of parliament, as well as he did: but he would not retaliate or reciprocate his wanton attack, for he disdained such rustic coarseness. He had merely objected that a witness was not legally bound to criminate himself, and at once the hon. member accused him of ignorance. He could not tamely bear such language as that which the hon. member had vomited forth. The hon. member was wholly unjustified in the coarse attack he had made upon him: and he trusted it might be permitted to him, as the Attorney-general, who, though Attorney-general, was still a member of that House, to repel it as he now did. He would say, that no
<col>970</col>
member of that House who sat or voted from any comer in it, voted or acted more independently than he did; and therefore he had reason to complain of the rudeness of the hon. member for Staffordshire. He had not given his opinion as Attorney-general. He had given it as a member of that House, and as independently as that hon. member or any other, and therefore it was, that he complained of his attack, as rude, wanton, and unfounded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00705"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he was sure his hon. friend, the member for Staffordshire, would see, on more cool reflection, that the attack he had made upon his learned friend had called for the warmth of expression with which he had met it. He had risen for the purpose of begging that any remarks arising from personal feeling might give way to the important subject under discussion. They were then acting in a different course from their ordinary proceeding, and it was of the utmost importance that they should go on with good temper. His learned friend had laid down the legal rule, consistent with justice and equity, that no man was bound to give an answer which might criminate himself; but, on the other hand, it was not meant to be denied, that as the witness before the committee was to be protected from the consequence of his answers, his case was taken out of the general rule; for if the witness could refuse to answer any question put to him, no investigation by that House could take place. In that respect, the House differed from the courts of law; and he remembered the case of a witness, an attorney, who was examined at that bar, who refused to divulge the secrets of his client; but that was overruled, and the House declared that the rules of the law courts did not apply; that for the ends of public justice it was necessary that he should answer, he being protected from the consequences. On these grounds, he was compelled to answer. The case before the House was one which, in his opinion, called for an application of the same rule; but he thought it was necessary that the witness should be informed that in answering, he would be protected from the consequences of his answers, He would suggest, therefore, that the resolution of the House of the 26th of March, 1818, be read to the witness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00706"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> rose for the purpose of stating the difference between evidence given before that House, and evidence given in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0493"/>
<col>971</col>
courts of law. In that House no evidence given could be used against the witness in any other place, without the permission of the House, and as that permission would not be granted where the party spoke the truth, his protection was complete. In the courts of law, the party giving evidence might refuse to answer what would criminate himself; but if he gave his answers voluntarily, the court could not protect him from the consequences.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00707"><member>Mr. Lyttleton</member><membercontribution> said, that nothing had fallen from him, that ought to have excited the irascibility in which the Attorney-general had so intemperately indulged. In what he had stated, he was not conscious that there had been any vulgarity or coarseness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00708"><member>Mr. Horace Twiss</member><membercontribution> wished to make a few observations with respect to the resolution of 1818. Unquestionably the rule in a court of justice was, that no man was bound to answer a question the answer to which might criminate himself. It had been said distinctly, with reference to the present case, that if the witness were to criminate himself by his answers, the House would protect him from all consequences injurious to himself. The right hon. gentleman had read the resolution of the House, which declared that no clerk, short-hand writer, or other officer of the House, should give evidence elsewhere of what had occurred in that House, without leave first obtained. That leave, he took it, would not be granted. But he begged to ask, if a witness was criminally prosecuted, what could prevent his conviction on the evidence of any two or three hon. members who had heard his confession in that House, and whose attendance in the court of justice it would not be in the power of the House to prevent? He had made this statement, not as presuming to lay down the law of parliament, but in order that, if wrong, he might be corrected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00709"><member>The Speaker.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I beg permission to say a few words. Some expressions have just fallen from the learned member for Wootton Bassett, which are so directly at variance with the first and most important privileges of this House, that I feel it my duty not to allow them to pass without notice. I understood him to say, that it might possibly, happen that a member of this House might be required to give evidence in a court of Law of what had passed within these walls. Now, I conceive, that hardly any doubt can exist in the mind of
<col>972</col>
any hon. member, that he is not at liberty to give evidence elsewhere of what passes here, without the direct, or at least the implied permission of the House. I wish to state this principle as broadly as possible; for if I am mistaken, it is high time that my error should be corrected. At present I certainly conceive, that on the privilege of preventing what passes here from being communicated elsewhere, vitally depends the dignity and the rights of this House. No hon. member who hears what passes within these walls (and no other person has a right to hear it) can be required, or allowed, to give evidence in a court of justice touching the matter which he has so heard.<lb/>
The witness was again called in, and the Chairman having read to him the resolution of the House respecting the protection given to witnesses, and told him that under such protection he was bound to answer all questions put to him, his examination proceeded,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00710"><member>By Mr. Tennyson.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I have received election-money after two elections, those of 1818 and 1820. About six weeks after Mr. Crompton and Mr. Evans were returned in the first election, two letters, without signature, were brought to my house. Each letter contained 20<i>l.</i> I do not know from whom they came. I did not know the hand-writing. They were directed to me. After the election of 1820, I received two letters, containing the same sums, addressed to me, and left in a similar way. I should conceive the money was left in consequence of the election. The lower freemen, I conceive, expected money after the election. I could not have received the money inconsequence of my vote, for I had not voted, or promised a vote; but as I am to speak the truth, I believe it was for the purposes of the election. The practice of receiving money was not general. It was confined to the lower freemen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00711"><member>By Mr. Peel.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;How came it to be sent to you?&#x2014;I was at that time a poor boy writing in the office in which I have now the honour to be a partner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00712"><member>By Mr. F. Clinton.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I was agent to sir H. W. Wilson. I got a promise of sixty-seven votes for him. I did not promise money. The freemen did not expect it, and the reason why I say they did not expect it is this&#x2014;I met sir H. Wilson one day near the town, and I told him the lower freemen expected money. He said, "My

<col>973</col>
good fellow, I will not talk about money, I have come here to do what is right and just." I mentioned this to the freemen, and they said they would vote for sir H. Wilson let the consequence be what it might. The witness further stated that, in his belief, there were forty persons at each election who did not receive money. The total number of electors was two hundred and sixty, of which number one hundred and twenty were resident. At the last election one hundred and seventy polled, of whom fifty-three were for sir H. W. Wilson, none of whom, in the belief of the witness, received money.<lb/>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00713"><member>By Mr. Tennyson.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Had been a freeman of East Retford for twenty years. Had been junior bailiff. The bailiffs were the returning officers. Was a smith and farrier by trade. Witness admitted after some hesitation that he had received money. Had received money, at three different times. The last occasion was after the last election. Two letters had been put into his house late at night, and at different times; they contained twenty guineas each. At the former election there had been one letter sent to his house containing twenty guineas. Witness believed it came from Mr. Crompton. Afterwards there came another. In 1812, the witness received no money. He had promised to vote for Mr. Osbaldiston: but when he applied for the election money, witness was told there was none for him; he was told that he was not a staunch blue. Never said that he and his family had received six score guineas. Whilst bailiff, witness belonged to the corporation. This was in 1820. Had received money after he had been bailiff.&#x2014;Did you not say, that the man who delivered the letter had concealed his face; but that you had found him out?&#x2014;No.</membercontribution></p>

It might be 20<i>l.</i> or 21<i>l.</i> The witness further stated, that he received the same sum on all occasions. There was a custom of paying the burgesses. It was not for their votes, it was a present. Witness has heard such a
<col>974</col>
custom mentioned. The son of witness is an apprentice at Retford. Does not recollect any conversation with the master of his son respecting a different rate to be paid for his board if the borough were disfranchised.<lb/>
Thomas Appleby examined.&#x2014;Witness was a burgess of East Retford, and had resided there all his life. Had received election money. Packets had been left at his house with his wife; there were two packets containing twenty guineas in each. This was in 1820; it was the same at the former election. Is a miller by trade, and an alderman of East Retford. At the election in 1807, he did not receive either money or present, when sir W. Ingilby and Mr. Crawford were returned. After the election in 1820, he got two packets, with the sum of twenty guineas in each. He could not say whether others got the same.<lb/>
William Clerk, examined by Mr. <i>Tennyson.</i>&#x2014;Has been a burgess and alderman of Retford for thirteen years. Remembers the 24th of February, 1819. He received forty guineas on the part of Mr. Evans. Does not know whether that was double the usual sum. Is not aware of the precise sum commonly given to the burgesses. Heard twenty guineas and forty guineas only mentioned as the respective considerations to voters. Never received forty guineas except once. Got no money on the side of Mr. Crompton in 1818. After that, on the 29th of May 1820. He was paid twenty guineas. Never was made the medium of transmitting twenty guineas to a Mr. Pierpoint, of Lincoln's-inn. Was thrice bailiff.<lb/>

Leadbetter, and heard him admit that he had got money at the election of 1812, on the part of Mr. Osbaldiston, and a similar consideration at the elections in 1818 and 1820. Within the last fortnight, Lead better had avowed to the fact of his having received money for his votes. He himself was not employed by any person to collect the evidence. His doing so was entirely of his own voluntary impulse. Another person named Sharpe did the same. He knew a man of the name of Hodson, and was told by Parnham that Hodson had told him he had received money from Fox, and changed a 20<i>l.</i> note out of it at Parnham's shop.<lb/>
On the motion of lord Nugent, Leadbetter was recalled, and the evidence of the last witness having been read over to him, he was asked if he still persisted in stating that he never had received any money in the years 1812, 1818, or 1820. The witness persisted in his former account, denying that he had received any money at either of those periods, directly or indirectly, or that he had ever said so to any person.<lb/>
The witness Hodson was also recalled, and examined to the same effect. He said he had never received a shilling from Fox on any body's account, or taken a 20<i>l.</i> note to Parnham's shop to change. He admitted that he dealt with Parnham for grocery, and owed him money at different times, but he must have recollected having changed a 20<i>l.</i> note at his shop if he had done so.</membercontribution></p>

Above four years had elapsed since the House had agreed, upon the motion of Mr. Canning, to certain resolutions expressive of their sense of the expediency of such an amelioration of the condition of the Slaves in the West Indies as might gradually lead to their emancipation. He believed, however, that no step had been taken by the Colonial Assemblies in furtherance of that most desirable object. He would take the
<col>976</col>
liberty of asking what course ministers intended to pursue with reference to this most important matter&#x2014;whether they meant to take the prosecution of it into their own hands, or to leave it in the hands of the colonial legislatures? If the latter still opposed every attempt to remedy the evils, government had the remedy entirely in their own hands. It was a short and simple one.

<p id="S2V0018P0-00721"><member>Mr. Bernal</member><membercontribution> said, he was as anxio s as the hon. member for Surrey to know what course ministers intended to pursue; whether the colonies were still to consider themselves as component parts of the British empire, or whether they were to be entirely isolated and distinct from that empire. It was high time to determine, whether the link which still bound the colonies to the mother country was to be dissolved or not. When the hon. gentleman talked of adopting a measure, for the purpose of bringing the question to a speedy issue, he seemed to forget that, by imposing a duty on the sugar exported from our colonies, a bounty would be given on the increase of the slave-trade, by the encouragement which would thereby be given to the importation of sugar from Martinique, the Havannah, the Brazils, &amp;c. where, the slave trade was still carried on to a horrible extent; more especially under the French flag. At that very moment an immense number of slaves were constantly transferring from the coast of Africa to the colonies he had mentioned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00722"><member>Sir A. Grant</member><membercontribution> said, that if the object of the petitioners was the annihilation of the slave trade, they could not do a greater favour to the West Indies than by petitioning for its utter annihilation. Great evil resulted to our West-India islands from the continuance of the trade in other quarters. As to the amelioration of the state of the slaves, a unanimous feeling pervaded the whole of the West-India proprietors to contribute to that object as far as it was in their power to do so; but to pursue that object by the means resorted to by many persons in this country, would only produce irritation in the minds of the colonists.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00726"><member>Dr. Lushington</member><membercontribution> thought, that the country stood so strongly pledged to the abolition of slavery, that no minister would dare to recede from those pledges.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00727"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, that as government had given a pledge to the country, that certain measures would be taken if the colonial legislatures did not do what was requisite to carry into effect its views, with respect to the abolition of the slave-trade, he wished to ask what had been done to procure from the colonial legislatures an acquiescence in the views of government with respect to the slave population; or, whether the proceedings of the colonial legislatures appeared to government to be so satisfactory as to preclude the necessity of any further measures in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00728"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, that the only answer he could give to the learned gentleman was, to refer him, in the first place, to the ample information which had been laid upon the table of the House. The resolution agreed to in 1823, with the returns consequent upon that measure, were both before parliament, and would soon be followed by further returns, developing what had been done, and what was in course of progress, relative to the improvement of the condition of the slaves. If that were considered the proper opportunity he would have no opportunity to enter into a statement of what had been effected by such of the colonies as possessed legislatures towards accomplishing the great work. There could not be the slightest doubt that the resolution of 1823, contemplated for the slave population the ultimate possession of civil rights, but it also contemplated that this transition should be effected without any interference with the rights of private property. It was perfectly true that no change had taken place in the system on which govern-
<col>978</col>
ment had acted towards the colonies, on he subject of slavery. The instructions sent out to the colonial governments were of the most clear and explicit nature, and founded upon the resolutions laid upon the table of that House. Now, those resolutions having been distinctly communicated, he was justified in drawing the inference, that the acquiescence which had taken place amounted to nothing less than implied adoption. In those colonies which had no local legislatures, some of the propositions adopted under the sanction of parliament had been carried into effect; and from their operation, it had been ascertained that no practical evil had resulted. In those having legislatures, the measures in question had been carried into effect with a greater or less degree of success; and as near an approximation had been made to the attainment of the objects in view as the fears and prejudices of the parties would allow. It was greatly to be regretted, that the resolutions of that House could not be carried into effect as speedily as was desirable; for if they went on as fast as they could wish, there was the utmost danger of throwing the colonies into confusion, without advancing the interests of the slaves, or attaining any of the objects which parliament had in view. Whatever change was to be effected, he hoped would be effected gradually, safely, and steadily&#x2014;that they would advance towards their object with that regard for the interests of the colonists which justice demanded. It might be true, and he believed it was, that no subject of his majesty was engaged in this traffic; be that, as it might, that the Police establishment was kept up; but assuredly it would form a very fit subject for the committee of finance to determine, whether this country should continue to expend for such a purpose so large an amount of British treasure and British life. That a great waste of both had taken place in the efforts to put down the slave-trade, as carried on by other countries, was a proposition which would not be disputed; and he was sorry to say, that the success attendant upon those measures was by no means commensurate to their cost. That species of smuggling trade offered a temptation so irresistible, presented a profit so enormous, resembled so strongly a trade without duty and without insurance, that nothing less than gigantic efforts could suppress it. He doubted whether any
<image src="S2V0018P0I0497"/>
<col>979</col>
naval power that we could conveniently bring into operation against it, would ever prove sufficient to suppress this traffic in human misery, stimulated as it ever was by unbounded cupidity. He assured the House, that every information upon the subject would be most cheerfully laid upon the table of the House, and that it was in full accordance with the duty as well as with the inclination of government, to carry into full effect the resolutions of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00729"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, that there were not two opinions relative to the abolition of the slave-trade. The House was bound by every principle of duty, as well as of national honour, to persist firmly in its course, until, as far as possible, that abominable traffic was abolished. AH he wished to know was, whether the government were satisfied with the acts of the local legislatures. If government were dissatisfied, then no further proceedings on his part would be necessary; but if they were satisfied with what had been done, he should bring forward the subject after the recess. The ultimate abolition of slavery had been the object of Mr. Pitt, and of Mr. Dundas. It was quite clear, that sooner or later the slaves in our colonies must become free. But the House must perceive, that the progress of the colonies was so slow as to be imperceptible to all human eyes, save their own; it did appear to him, that they themselves must perceive that they were standing still instead of advancing towards the goal at which it was the wish of that House they should gradually, but certainly arrive. If that was his view of the question, it became his duty, as a member of the legislature, to see that the intentions of that House were carried into effect, not precipitately, but without any unnecessary delay. Whether little had been done or much had been done by our colonists, it was not his intention at that moment to inquire; but it did appear to him, with respect to the colonies generally, that out of twenty heads of regulation and improvement recommended to them, there were no less than nine in which not a single, colony had taken, or even affected to take, a single step. He would take two of our principal colonies &#x2014;Jamaica and Barbadoes; one having a population of 360,000, and the other a population of 80,000 or 90,000 persons, making in all a population of between
<col>980</col>
400,000 and 500,000 slaves; and he found that in these extensive colonies not one single step had been taken with respect to sixteen out of twenty heads of regulation proposed to them by the Colonial Department. In looking to what little had been done by the colonies, in obedience to the recommendation of the legislature, it was impossible that that House could, consistently with its own character and dignity, allow a sixth year to elapse, without adopting some effectual means to enforce the salutary regulations they had so fruitlessly recommended to our colonial establishments. That all proper attention should be paid to the protection of private property, he fully admitted: he might, however, be allowed to take one exception, in which, he believed, he differed from his hon. friend (Mr. Bernal); namely, that they ought to take no step for the manumission or relief of the slave, until they had established a perfect scale of remuneration. If they were to lay down such a rule as this, it was impossible that any thing beneficial could ever be carried into effect; it would, in fact, be in such a case impossible ever to abolish the slave-trade. To take a case in point&#x2014;What scale of remuneration was laid down, when, by the abolition of the slave-trade, some thousand tons of shipping were thrown out of employment? Did any man dream of retarding that great measure, until the merchants and shipowners were protected against any loss to their trade? No such thing: the measure was introduced, and the ships were turned into privateers (a service not far removed from piracy) and sent upon other services, but the country heard nothing of any claims for remuneration. Where a grievance of this crying nature existed, their first duty was to put an end to it; and if it was afterwards found that parties were injured by such a measure, then would come the question of compensation. Why, he asked, not call upon the colonies at once to consider this subject? If they wanted the will, it was as bad in his view as if they wanted the power; and in either case parliament was bound equally to interfere. Let the House do that which they thought right; and when persons could make out that they had been damnified by the measures so adopted, then would come the time for talking of compensation. Let the House remedy
<image src="S2V0018P0I0498"/>
<col>981</col>
any loss which individuals may sustain by their efforts to do justice to the slave-population of our colonies; but let them not refrain from doing justice until they had fixed the manner and amount of that remedy. It was probable, too, that the remedy, if they were to set about fixing it, would be for an imaginary injury; for there were many points upon which it would be wild to talk of compensation. He would take one by way of illustration, and in support of which he was supported by the opinions of the present lord chancellor and several high authorities&#x2014;he meant the propriety of taking the evidence of slaves in all legal proceedings. This was a reform which might be easily, surely, and safely effected, and which they were, therefore, called upon to effect. But if they did that, who was there to come forward and say that he had a claim to compensation? The same observation would apply to most of the heads of regulation to which he had alluded. He should be most happy to see the colonial legislatures acting as they should do; but if he found such not to be the case, the present might be considered as a notice of his intention to take up the subject soon after the recess.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CHARITIES IN ENGLAND AND WALES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00731"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> said, that in moving for a Return of the number of Bills filed in the Courts of Equity, under the authority of the Commissioners appointed to inquire concerning Charities in England and Wales, he felt it necessary to say a few words in explanation of the object which he had in view. He was anxious, in the first place, to avoid the supposition that he was actuated by any unfriendly feeling to the principle in which the inquiry into the abuses existing in charitable institutions had originated. He therefore stated, most distinctly, that instead of being actuated by unfriendly, he was actuated by the most friendly, feeling towards them. He thought, however, that the time had arrived, in which some information respecting the result of their labours should be afforded to the House by the commissioners of inquiry, beyond that contained in the bulky volumes now upon the table. He believed that of all the commissions which had ever been issued at die desire of parliament, no one had ever been attended with such costly results,
<col>982</col>
and with such slight beneficial consequences as the commission which was appointed in 1818 to inquire into the abuses of charitable institutions. During the last twenty-six years, it appeared that there had been thirty-eight special reports presented from various commissions of inquiry into objects of great national interest. Of that fact the House was well aware; but he did not apprehend that either the House or the country was prepared to hear the enormous amount of the sum expended in getting up the reports. The sum amounted to a million of money within a very few pounds; and yet, if the consequences of the reports were looked at, he believed that they would not be found to have led to practical results commensurate with such a heavy expenditure. He would say, that the commission which had been appointed in 1818 to inquire concerning charities in England and Wales had been the least productive of benefit of all the commissions which had ever been appointed, and that it had also been, with a single exception, the most lavish and extravagant in its expenditure. That commission had not half terminated its labours; and yet the money advanced to the commissioners up to 1826, for the prosecution of their inquiries, amounted to 120,000<i>l.</i>, independent of 30,000<i>l.</i>, which were to be added to that sum as their annual expenditure from the period of their last report. What had been the result of their labours? He thought no one could say what it was, unless it were the terror with which every gentleman must have been inspired on seeing placed on his table seventeen huge folio volumes of reports, containing, on an average, eight hundred pages each; to which another folio of five hundred pages had been added the other day, by way of index to the first fourteen volumes. He was convinced, that more than half the paper, which had been wasted on these reports, might have been spared. Their reports were little else than a transcript of the titles by which the charitable institutions were founded; a transcript which was of no use except to swell the bulk of the volumes, to increase the expense of printing them, and to deter persons from inquiring into their contents. The great object of his present motion was to place before the House and the country the real state of the labours of the commission, in restoring dormant rights, and rectifying the abuses which they had found to exist.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0499"/>
<col>983</col>
For, unless some course shall be pursued, by which the property devised by our ancestors for pious and charitable uses could be restored to the poor, for whose education and support it was intended&#x2014;unless some measures are taken by which property bequeathed to charitable institutions could be wrested from those who, from various causes, sometimes from connivance, sometimes from negligence, and sometimes from events, of which, in the lapse of time, the cause was forgotten, had turned the channel of charity into their own purses and pockets&#x2014;unless some practical remedy shall be applied to all cases in which grievances and corruptions have been found to exist, all the labour and all the expense of the commission had been expended in vain. He would mention but one instance, in which he should like to know what good had been effected by the commission. He saw, from the report of the commissioners, that there was a charity which had been very liberally endowed many years since, in the parish of Brentwood, in Essex. It had been established for the purpose of affording to the sons of the inhabitants of that town moral, virtuous, and religious instruction, and of giving them what is generally called a classical education; and funds had been left, with such objects, commensurate to their support. It so happened, that in the lapse of time, and from several accidental causes, those funds had increased from 100<i>l.</i> to 2,000<i>l.</i> a year; and yet, strange to say, on that foundation not more than three children were at present educated, while the whole of the funds were in the Receipt of the patron of the school, who applied them chiefly to the benefit of his own family. Now, he would ask, had any remedy been applied to this case of evil? If none had been applied, of what use had been the appointment of the commission? If the village of Brentwood was not in itself of size and importance sufficient to require a school to be kept up in it at an expense of 2,000<i>l.</i> a year, would it not be more consonant to the views of the founder of the charity to divert a part of them to other objects in that village, having charity for their basis, or to some object of county importance? It appeared that the commissioners had themselves entertained at one time such a suggestion; but they had subsequently displayed an anxious desire to throw the veil of oblivion, over the whole transaction, and to stifle all
<col>984</col>
inquiry into it. They said that there were certain circumstances which had a tendency to render it very difficult, or almost impossible, to arrive at any clear account of the transactions of the patron, who had first diverted the funds. They then proceeded to say, that it was right to observe that, from such private letters and papers as remained concerning the patron's transactions, it might reasonably be inferred, that he was under the influence of motives which were not perfectly fair and honourable; and then, without giving any further statement of what his motives were, they added, that as the injury sustained from his mismanagement, or default, if any such there were, affected the interests of the master rather than those of the charity, it did not appear to them that any benefit would at present arise from any further investigation into that part of the subject. Now, he thought that such a statement on the mere face of it required that the commissioners should enter forthwith into further details, and into further inquiries; and yet they had come to the singular conclusion, that no further investigation into that part of the subject was at all necessary. There was another evil likely to arise out of the proceedings of the commissioners. They were now, for the benefit of cunning lawyers, placing the charity under the revision of the court of Chacery&#x2014;a proceeding which was certain to be attended with expense, and might, in the long run, consume all the funds of each charity.&#x2014;He would not enter at greater length into the objects which he hoped to effect by his motion, but would move "for Returns of the number of Bills filed in the Courts of Equity by the Attorney-general, at the instance of the Commissioners appointed to inquire concerning Charities in England and Wales, from the commencement of their appointment to the 1st of March, 1828; specifying the names of the defendants, the object of each proceeding, the result of each cause terminated, the costs incurred, and by whom and to whom paid&#x2014;the present state of the causes in progress; and also a detail of those cases in which inquiry has restored dormant rights, or rectified abuses found to exist; also of the probable length of time which may elapse before their inquiries terminate.&#x2014;Of the total expenses which have been incurred, from the commencement of the inquiry to the 1st of March, 1818; distinguishing sums paid

<title>INCREASE OF CRIME.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00733"><member> Mr. Dugdale</member><membercontribution> presented a petition from the magistrates for the county of Warwick, assembled at the quarter-sessions, stating the great increase of crime in that county, and praying that the House would take the subject into their most serious consideration, and apply such a remedy as its importance demanded. The hon. gentleman observed, that great anxiety existed throughout the county with reference to this subject. The greatest increase was of juvenile offenders. About ten years ago, the magistrates established an asylum in the county of Warwick, for receiving juvenile offenders after conviction, which had been attended at the time with the most beneficial effects. Of late years, however, crime had increased in the county with alarming rapidity. At the late quarter-sessions, of one hundred and fifty-two prisoners convicted, seventy-five, or eighty, were boys under fifteen years of age. It was impossible, of course, to receive so many into an asylum which was maintained by private contributions. A pamphlet had lately been published by a magistrate of the county, sir E. Wilmot, in which, for the purpose of preventing the evils which resulted from the commitment of mere boys to gaol, he recommended that, in certain cases, the magistrates should have the power of summary conviction. Such was also the opinion of many other respectable magistrates. Certain it was, that notwithstanding every effort that had been made, and after every allowance for an increasing population, crime had of late increased in an alarming degree. He trusted that this petition would be referred to the committee now sitting to consider the causes of the increase of crime.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00734"><member>Mr. Lawley</member><membercontribution> looked upon the evil as one of great magnitude, and mainly attributable to the existing state of the law. Boys were brought before the magistrate, charged with various offences; and under the circumstances, the magistrate had no alternative, but was constrained to commit them to gaol. In gaol, therefore, they
<col>986</col>
might remain for three months before the time of their trial should arrive; and such was the demoralizing effect of prison association, that a boy so committed would inevitably come out of gaol ten thousand times worse than he went in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00735"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> said, he knew nothing more afflicting than to see so many poor children brought to the bar at every assizes. In the county which he represented the increase of crime, and especially among youth, was most alarming. In 1825, there were eighteen children under fifteen years of age convicted in Staffordshire; in 1826, there were thirty-two; in 1827, forty. In 1825, there were eighty-seven young men, between fifteen and twenty years of age, convicted in the same county; in 1826, there were a hundred and thirty-seven; and in 1827, a hundred and sixty-four. This was really a most horrible evil. He believed that many of the magistrates were inclined to think that it would be advisable to give the power of summary conviction in certain cases. The bias of his mind was strongly in favour of such a measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00736"><member>Sir T. Lethbridge</member><membercontribution> entirely concurred in the extent of the evil, and the necessity for some remedy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00737"><member>Sir J. Wrottesley</member><membercontribution> was of opinion that the existence of this youthful immorality could not be justly attributed to a want of employment for the children of the poorer classes, as it prevailed in the agricultural counties, where work, was to be had in abundance. He thought it might with more propriety be referred to the too great prevalence of criminal prosecutions. By late returns it appeared that out of ninety thousand commitments, thirty thousand got a discharge without trial, as the bills were ignored by the grand jury. This he could not but believe to be the result of the recent act which permitted prosecutors their expenses, as it naturally tended to increase frivolous prosecutions. After the initiation into all kinds of turpitude, which a gaol was so calculated to effect, it was not a matter of surprise that depravity should extensively prevail throughout the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00738"><member>Mr. Portman</member><membercontribution> thought that separate jurisdictions were injurious; and that there should be no commitments except by two or three magistrates acting together. As to the great increase in the number of juvenile offenders, he did not believe that it originated so much from
<image src="S2V0018P0I0501"/>
<col>987</col>
boys being worse than they were formerly, but from the fact, that for offences, in reference to which it was now the usage to commit the offenders, those offenders were in former times soundly whipped by the individuals against whom they committed the offences, but who were now afraid to take that course, lest an action should be brought against them for an assault.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CATHOLIC EMANCIPATION&#x2014;PETITION<lb/> OF CATHOLICS OF IRELAND.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00740"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, he was commissioned by the general body of the Catholics of Ireland to present to the House a Petition, praying for the removal of the disabilities under which they laboured. The petition he had to present to the House involved such important interests, and embraced concerns of such magnitude to the welfare of individuals as well as of the country at large, that he was induced to break through a general rule he had laid down to himself, of not occupying the attention of the House upon the presentation of petitions. He felt convinced that the condition of the petitioners excited the sympathy not only of a majority in parliament, but of a vast portion of their fellow-subjects in Ireland and in England; and that it would be a great relief to the House and to the country, if parliament would take into consideration the claims of the Roman Catholics, as well as of persons labouring under disqualifications on account of their religious opinions. Upon the hardships under which the Catholics laboured some persons were disposed not to lay so much stress as he did; they thought it no very great grievance to labour under these disabilities; but, in his opinion, nothing could be more galling to the mind of an honourable man, than in his own country to be considered as a proscribed person&#x2014;to have a mark set upon him for his conscientious religious belief&#x2014;to be held up as a person unworthy of trust, and incapacitated from receiving all marks of honour and emolument&#x2014;as a person whose career was arrested in every course of ambition, however beneficial to the individual or to the state&#x2014;to have the finger of scorn pointed at him, and to be compelled to witness other persons having every possible advantage over him on account of their religious belief: this was
<col>988</col>
not only galling to the mind of the individual, but prejudicial to the interests of the country at large. The pretences on which the disabilities were continued appeared to him to be weakened every day; and when he saw millions of people who were calling for the repeal of those disabilities (for, putting together the Catholics of England and Ireland, they amounted probably to not less, numerically, than one half of the population of the United Kingdom), then adding to them the wishes of such members of the established church, and the other Protestant churches in this country, as were favourable to the Catholics, he was entitled to say that a large preponderating weight of public opinion was in favour of granting the just claims of the Catholics. In behalf of the Catholics of the United Kingdom, he denied all the charges and imputations that had been thrown out against them. He denied that it was true, or founded on truth, that they owed any divided allegiance, or that they had not a common interest with men of every religious persuasion in this country. He denied that they were less desirous of upholding the institutions of the country than any other class of the community. On the part of the Catholics he would declare, that rather than be actuated by the feelings which were attributed to them they would forego the accomplishment of their just claims, by the granting of the little that remained to be conceded, and would willingly endure all the penalties from which they had been relieved. But in behalf of the character of the Catholics, he would appeal from the evidence of interested calumniators and monopolizers of power under the pretence of religion, to the equity of parliament, and would demand for them relief from their disabilities, on the broad, general principle of religious liberty&#x2014;the principle on which our church and all Protestant churches were founded. If it was reprehensible in the Catholic church to visit with penalties those who dissented from them, it was tenfold more unjust and inconsistent with the principles on which our church was established, to maintain similar penalties on account of the religious opinions of persons of whatever persuasion they might be. In conclusion he trusted that the petitioners would receive that attention which their cause, connected as it was with the great interests of the state, so eminently demanded [hear].

<title>PRINTING EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE.]</title><p id="S2V0018P0-00741"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> said, he was induced to move for some particulars of the expense of printing certain papers by order of the House, on account of the great sums which had been laid out in that way, and the apparent uselessness of that expenditure. He wished to be understood as having no intention of curtailing the right of petitioning, or of having petitions printed. What he principally objected to was the appendices to the reports of the committees, which seemed to convey no information whatever. The appendix to the slavery report, for instance, contained nothing but the names of slaves and their masters and mistresses, accompanied with declarations as to the good or bad qualities of the latter. The expense of printing these papers for the last year was calculated at 80,000<i>l.</i>, and in some years it had amounted to 120,000<i>l.</i> After stating his intention to move for the appointment of a committee to investigate the subject, the hon. member concluded by moving for returns of the expense attending the printing the reports on slavery, on the Game-laws, on the burning of Hindoo widows, and other subjects.&#x2014;The motion was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REGISTRATION OF FREEHOLDERS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00742"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> rose, pursuant to notice, to move "for leave to bring in a Bill for the Registration of Freeholders in England and Wales." He observed that a committee had been appointed last session to consider the mode of taking polls at elections, and a bill was printed by their directions for the use of the House. It would therefore be the less necessary for him to detain them at any length on the present occasion. He would, however, explain briefly the principle of the measure, and the reason upon which it was founded. The great object he had in view was to diminish the expense of elections, by having the poll taken at different parts of the county, instead of bringing the electors from various distances all to the place. The chief objection to the plan was, that it would be difficult to know who were voters and who were not, and that it would be necessary to
<col>990</col>
have, in those different places, the whole machinery of an election, with its counsel, poll-clerks, &amp;c, which would operate as an increase, instead of a diminution, of the expense. It appeared, therefore, indispensable that some arrangement should be made to meet this objection&#x2014;to settle who had the right of voting. The principle upon which the present bill was founded was to provide, that that which now took place at the election should in future take place before the election; so that the right of the voters should be as well proved and established before they were put on the list, as they were now, after the proofs were gone into on the objection of either party. This was a preparatory measure, and was, in fact, essentially necessary to the great object he had in view. A complete registry of voters would greatly assist in simplifying the business of elections. The principle of the bill was one which he thought likely to meet with general approbation: it was to apply the scrutiny of votes before the election, when men's passions were not engaged, and by that means to obviate the objection to taking the poll at different parts of the same county. The noble lord concluded with moving "for leave to bring in a Bill for the Registration of Freeholders in the different Counties of England and Wales."</membercontribution></p>

<title>TREATY OF LIMERICK.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00745"><member>Sir Henry Parnell</member><membercontribution> rose, pursuant to notice, to move "that a Copy of the Treaty of Limerick be laid upon the table." Many petitions had, he said, been presented in the course of the present session from the Roman Catholics of Ireland, in which they prayed for a restoration of the civil privileges of which they had been deprived on account of their religious opinions. These petitions stated, that the laws and statutes by which the Roman Catholics were deprived of their civil rights had been, framed in direct violation of the compact entered into between the Irish nation and king William 3rd, the conditions of which compact were comprised in the Treaty of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0503"/>
<col>991</col>
Limerick. When so numerous and important a body as the Catholics of Ireland made statements like those in the petitions presented to that House, he thought the document referred to ought to be before the House, in order that hon. members might understand whether or not those statements were well founded. It was not his intention upon the present occasion to trouble the House with many arguments on the import or particular construction of the articles of the Treaty of Limerick; but there were facts and circumstances connected with the execution of it, which should be stated, in order that the nature of the document might be clearly understood. Many hon. members might think that the Treaty referred to nothing more than the quelling of a popular insurrection, and to a victory easily gained by regular English soldiers over an unprincipled rabble; and that king William 3rd had only to send an army to Ireland to subdue it; but if they examined into the occurrences that preceded the treaty they would find it to be a very different transaction. How did the case stand? Until the period of the Union, Ireland had been an independent country, wholly independent of England, with which she was connected only by the circumstance of her acknowledging that she owed allegiance to the same king. When the Revolution of 1688 took place in this country, James 2nd was expelled, not less for political than for religious reasons; the people of Ireland, being Roman Catholics continued that allegiance to James which his English subjects had withdrawn: accordingly, they acknowledged him for their king, and recognized his authority.<lb/>
He repeated, it would be found that until the Union, Ireland was a perfectly independent country; and when the Protestant Revolutionary party of this country thought proper to dethrone king James, the people of Ireland did not feel the same necessity, and they continued to acknowledge him as their legitimate king. Lord Tyrconnel, at that time lord lieutenant of Ireland, carried on the government on behalf of James, as the government of an independent State. In August 1689, king William sent his first army to Ireland. The time passed away without any thing being done, in consequence of the sickness of the troops, till the July of the next year, 1690, when the battle, of the Boyne was fought, and a
<col>992</col>
victory gained over James by the English forces. In that year an attempt was made by William to take the city of Limerick, but he was repulsed from the walls by the garrison; James's army still amounting to thirty thousand men. It was not till the month of August, 1691, that the second siege of Limerick was commenced, under general Ginkle; the garrison held out, and defended the city from that period to the October following, when they capitulated, and that Treaty was signed which formed the subject of the present motion.&#x2014;Thus it appeared that the conquest of Ireland occupied a large army, amounting to about thirty thousand men, successively under the command of William and the most distinguished of his generals, for a period of two years and two months, from the first landing of the English forces to the surrender of Limerick. At the time of that surrender, the affairs of James 2nd were not so desperate as might be supposed; for several towns were still held by his garrisons, and five of the largest counties in Ireland were more immediately in possession of his adherents. Under such circumstances, the House well knew what must have been the value of the surrender of Limerick to the English forces&#x2014;it was, in fact, not merely the surrender of Limerick which then took place, but the surrender of all Ireland. Let it be recollected also, that at this very time, a French fleet was in full sail to the assistance of the Irish&#x2014;was, in fact, in the channel, with large reinforcements, and arrived three days after the articles of capitulation had been signed. In consequence of this treaty, a body of eighteen thousand men embarked for France, being a part of the army of Ireland. By this treaty were conceded to king William the garrisons, towns, and all the territory hitherto held for James, by his adherents, in that country, and the regal authority of William was acknowledged. Thus, he said, the Irish people, notwithstanding they had expectations of support, gave up the king of their own religion, and acknowledged the authority of William.<lb/>
The House would remember that by this treaty William not only acquired possession of Ireland, but obtained a confirmation of the Settlement acts of the Revolution of 1688. The latter circumstance must have been the more acceptable to William, as at that period the party of James was exceedingly powerful, not
<image src="S2V0018P0I0504"/>
<col>993</col>
only in Ireland, but also in England &#x2014;a state of things the more dangerous to William, as he was frequently obliged to be absent from his more immediate territories, on account of the contest in which he was engaged with Louis 14th. About this period, William's forces and those of his allies had sustained considerable reverses when opposed to the French troops. All these occurrences made the settlement of Ireland a matter exceedingly desirable to William; and when that object was accomplished, he was enabled to turn his arms more easily against Louis 14th: and, having placed our foreign relations on a more satisfactory footing, he finally fixed his power on a firm basis, and established that free constitution which the country at present enjoyed. The first article of the Treaty to which he had alluded was the following. Before he quoted it, he should premise, that it was one of the articles on which the Roman Catholics mainly relied&#x2014;
<quote>"That the Roman Catholics of this country shall enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their religion, as are consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of king Charles 2nd, and their majesties, as soon as their affairs will permit them to summon a parliament in this kingdom, will endeavour to procure the said Roman Catholics such farther security, in that particular, as may preserve them from any disturbance on account of their said religion."</quote>
That, he repeated, was the principal article on which the Roman Catholics relied; but there was another, the 9th, which was also deserving of consideration, and was in the following terms:&#x2014;
<quote>"The oath to be administered to such Roman Catholics as submit themselves to their majesties' government shall be the oath aforesaid, and no other."</quote>
It was not the intention to go into any arguments on the purport or construction of this treaty: he would only observe, that the Roman Catholics were secured against any disturbance in the exercise of their religious privileges in the 1st article of the treaty; and that by the 9th article they were only required to take the oath of allegiance to their majesties. Be it remembered, that this was the short and simple oath of allegiance, and not similar to some oaths or declarations subsequently devised, as it embraced nothing except a declaration of loyalty to the reigning monarch.<lb/>
<col>994</col>
With regard to the circumstances supposed to have occurred since the execution of that treaty, he wished to say that, in his mind, what was advanced against the construction put upon it by the Roman Catholics was not tenable. One of the leading arguments against the efficacy of the treaty, arose out of the length of time since its execution; and the opponents of the Roman Catholics contended, that if they could claim any thing under the treaty, their claim was now obsolete, because they had permitted a long interval to elapse without preferring it. In reply to this, he wished to state, that the Roman Catholics had never permitted any opportunity to pass away of pressing their claims, as founded on the basis of that treaty. In confirmation of this opinion he referred the House to the work of Dr. Currie, on the "Civil Wars of Ireland," where they would find, in the conduct pursued by sir Theobald Buller and sir Stephen Rice, before both Houses of the Irish parliament, in relation to this treaty, a full refutation of the argument referred to. During the administration of lord Halifax, the Roman Catholics applied to be allowed the benefits of the treaty, and in 1792, in their petition and memorial presented to the king, they again refer to these articles, and claim the enjoyment of the privileges promised them. He repeated, there had been no occasion since the period when these. articles were framed, which the Roman Catholics had not embraced, to put forward their claims as founded on the Treaty of Limerick. On their part he might therefore argue, that by their continual reference to the articles of the treaty, they had proved that they had not forgotten the value of the claim which that treaty enabled them to make. Smollett calls the Treaty of Limerick the Charter of the Liberties of Ireland. If so, it is certainly not one of great effect. High authorities might be quoted on this subject, and opinions which would have the greater weight, as they had been delivered in that House. Dr. Laurence, than whom there was no more respectable authority, repeatedly declared his opinion, that the articles of the Treaty of Limerick had been violated by the continued exclusion of the Roman Catholics from the enjoyment of civil privileges on account of their religious belief. Lord Plunkett's sentiments on the subject were similar, as was well known to the House, which had frequently heard them
<image src="S2V0018P0I0505"/>
<col>995</col>
expressed. But he now came to an opinion which carried still more weight along with it, and deserved to be received with the highest respect&#x2014;he meant the authority of Mr. Burke. The opinion of that great man and profound statesman, as it appeared in the edition of his Posthumous Works, published in 1812, fully corroborated the view which he (sir Henry) took of the case. Up to the period of the publication of the tracts to which he referred, those who entertained similar opinions to those of Mr. Burke on the subject of the treaty, had not had the benefit of his authority; at least, were unable to quote it in an authentic form. He would now read a few lines from Mr. Burke's tract on the Popery Laws, contained in the 9th vol. of the 8vo. edition of 1812:&#x2014;
<quote>"It will now be seen, that even if these (the Popery) laws could be supposed agreeable to those of nature in these particulars, in another, and almost as strong a principle, they are yet unjust, as being contrary to positive compact, and the public faith most solemnly plighted. On the surrender of Limerick, and some other Irish garrisons in the war of the Revolution, the lords justices of Ireland, and the commander-in-chief of the king's forces, signed a capitulation with the Irish, which was afterwards ratified by the king himself by inspextinces under the Great Seal of England. It contains some public articles relative to the whole body of the Roman Catholics in that kingdom, and some with regard to the security to the greater part of the inhabitants of five counties. What the latter were, or in what manner they were observed, is at this day of much less public concern. The former are two&#x2014;the first and the ninth. The first is of this tenour:&#x2014;'The Roman Catholics of this kingdom (Ireland) shall enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their Religion, as are consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of king Charles 2nd, and their Majesties, as soon as their affairs will permit them to summon a parliament in this kingdom, will endeavour, to procure the said Roman Catholics such further security in that particular, as may preserve them from any disturbance upon the account of their said religion.' The ninth article is to this effect:&#x2014;'The oath to be administered to such Roman Catholics as submit themselves to their Majesties' Government shall be the oath aforesaid, and no other, viz.&#x2014;
<col>996</col>
the Oath of Allegiance made by Act of Parliament in England, in the first year of their Majesties' reign, as required by the second of the Articles of Limerick.' Compare this latter article with the penal laws, and judge whether they seem to be the public acts of the same power, and observe whether other oaths are tendered to them, and under what penalties. Compare the former with the same laws from the beginning to the end, and judge whether the Roman Catholics have been preserved, agreeably to the sense of the article, from any disturbance upon account of their religion; or rather, whether, on that account, there is a single right of nature or benefit of society which has not been either totally taken away, or considerably impaired."</quote>
These were the opinions of Mr. Burke on the subject of the Treaty of Limerick, and of the treatment which the Roman Catholics had experienced, and he sincerely trusted, that before the subject of the Catholic claims came regularly under discussion, honourable members, previous to giving their votes, one way or the other, would take the trouble to recur to those opinions of Mr. Burke, and, assisted by the light they afforded, endeavour to come to a correct judgment on that important topic.<lb/>
He had now little more to say, and should only refer shortly to what tended strongly to confirm his views, in regard to this subject; namely, the nature of the arguments used by the opponents of the Roman Catholics. He was prepared to assert, that the weakness of those arguments afforded to his mind as strong a conviction of the propriety of conceding the Roman Catholic claims, as did the cogency of the arguments adopted by those who held the same sentiments as himself. He repeated, that if he could wish for any thing to confirm the view he had taken of the Treaty of Limerick, it would be found in the arguments used by those writers who took a different view of the question. There was a pamphlet of Mr. Arthur Brown, formerly member for the University of Dublin, who gave a construction of the article different from that which he (sir Henry) had stated; but he had been able to discover nothing in Mr. Brown's arguments that did not confirm, rather than weaken, the construction usually put upon the Treaty. Among other violent opponents of the Roman Catholics was the late Dr. Duigenan. That learned gentleman wrote against the view taken by
<image src="S2V0018P0I0506"/>
<col>997</col>
the Catholics of the Treaty of Limerick; but he confessed that the learned doctor's arguments had no other effect upon his mind, except to confirm his conviction of the accuracy and justice of the construction put upon the Treaty by the friends of the Roman Catholics.<lb/>
There was another topic to which he had already alluded, but, if the House would permit him, he would again recur to it. The length of time that had elapsed since the Treaty was agreed on, had been urged as an argument why it could not apply to the present occasion. And it was also inferred, that the acquiescence of the Roman Catholics in the disabilities imposed upon them, or at least the fact of their forbearing to urge the provisions of the Treaty, as arguments against deprivation of civil rights, afforded a conclusive proof that they could not rely upon the provisions of the Treaty. Before arriving at this conclusion, the House would do well to take into its consideration the state to which Ireland had been reduced by the Penal-laws, and the condition in which the Roman Catholics had been placed by their operation. Under these laws, the Roman Catholics were deprived of all political power, and reduced to such a state of degradation as almost to justify him in saying, that they were deprived of the use of their understanding. Such was the condition of the Catholics under the operation of these laws, the effect of which was to inflict on them civil death, from the reign of queen Anne up to the relaxation of the penal code. Considering that this was the state of the Catholics from 1703 to 1793, or within a few years of that period, it was not wonderful that they acted as they had done. If, in all that time, it so happened that they had never referred to the Treaty of Limerick, or attempted to claim under it those privileges which they now pretended it guaranteed, the circumstance was by no means incapable of explanation, when their degraded situation was considered, and when it was recollected what was the nature of the grievances which pressed upon them.<lb/>
He again expressed his opinion, that it ought not to be wondered at if, during that long period, no great effort was made on their part to enforce their claim. That period, then, ought to be put out of consideration, for the population of Ireland was oppressed and stupefied by the weight of the penal code. As soon as
<col>998</col>
their moral and political feelings were restored, as soon as they thought they could perceive any hope of getting rid of the burthen that weighed them to the earth, they put forward their claims, founded upon the articles of this Treaty; claims which he contended were now as good as they were on the first day when the Treaty was entered into. Mr. Burke had stated it to be his conviction, that the faith of England was solemnly plighted to Ireland by the Treaty of Limerick; that the king was bound to observe the articles of that Treaty, and that the enactment of the Penal-laws was a breach of a distinct promise given at the time of the capitulation of Limerick. Fortified by this opinion he should not add anything of his own to weaken the force of the authority. He would only say, that the faith of England was plighted to afford the Irish Catholics relief; and, if possible, compensation for the evils inflicted on them. The hon. baronet concluded with moving, for "a Copy of the Letters Patent wherein the Civil Articles for the Surrender of the Treaty of Limerick in the year 1691 were ratified and exemplified by king William the 3rd and Queen Mary."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00746"><member>Mr. H. Grattan</member><membercontribution> said, he rose to second the motion, and he did so in the persuasion that the case of the Catholics of Ireland would be made out by the document, Indeed, he had not a doubt upon his mind but that if twelve honest men were placed at the bar to decide on the meaning of the articles, they could not hesitate to adopt the interpretation for which the Catholics and their friends contended. The question, as it appeared to him, resolved itself into a mere matter of fact: it was merely whether such a Treaty had ever been completed; for on the meaning of the terms there could be no dispute. He thought at the same time that his hon. friend would fall short of his object if he persisted in confining his motion to the civil articles; for there were two copies of the Treaty originally published&#x2014;one in Ireland, and the other in England; and it was curious to observe that the one printed in London omitted to state that the king had sanctioned them. This had, to him, the appearance of an intention, from the beginning, to break through the articles. Such conduct was not without example in the transactions of this government. The Crown had disowned what its servants had done for Ireland, both in the reigns of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0507"/>
<col>999</col>
Elizabeth and of Charles 1st, when money was refused which had been voted for public purposes. They ought, therefore, to have the two documents before them, in order to show that at the very outset the Treaty was conceived in a spirit of insincerity. The first article stipulated, that the Catholics should enjoy their religion without obstruction. What was the meaning of that? It did not merely mean that they should be permitted to enter their chapels, and worship according to their own forms; nor did it mean that their clergy should dress in canonicals according to the institution of their order; but it meant, if it meant any thing, that the people should not be injured in their civil rights on account of the religion they professed. But what was the state of the law of Ireland at the time? He would deny that it contained any statute excluding Catholics from sitting in parliament.&#x2014;He would next advert to the privileges enjoyed by the Catholics in the time of Charles the 2nd. The House would be surprised to hear that the only mode in which Catholics were prevented from coming into parliament was by a simple resolution of the House of Commons. Such a resolution could not be considered law, any more than other resolutions of the same period. There was a servile appeal of a committee of the Irish House of Commons to the Lords Justices, recommending that Catholics should be driven, not only out of the House but out of the town. Such was the spirit of legislation at that period: and would the House believe that the same parliament had passed an act, calling upon the Catholics to surrender themselves within three days at the walls of Dublin under a penalty? Such was the act completed by two traitors sitting in the castle of Dublin, and aided by a profligate and corrupt parliament. He asked whether that was a law which any man could rely upon as a bar to the articles of the Treaty of Limerick? But what, during this time, was the conduct of the House of Lords? For, unless it could be proved that they had acted <i>pari passu</i> with the House of Commons, it would seem as if they had doubted the propriety of the proceedings of the House of Commons. And there was no. room for hesitation on this point, for this resolution would be found upon their Journals&#x2014;"Resolved, that a bill be introduced to make valid the resolutions of the House of
<col>1000</col>
Commons with respect to Roman Catholics." The absurdity of such a measure was only equalled by its illegality. The House of Lords again met in 1641, and there was no allusion to be found in their Journals to the ceremony of administering the oath of supremacy. The same was the casein 1642,1643,1644,1645, and 1646; and yet it was now contended, that to exclude Roman Catholic peers from sitting in parliament was not a violation of the Treaty of Limerick, because they had not enjoyed that privilege previously to it. He would show the want of foundation for such an assertion by reference to another resolution on the Journals of their lordships' House. On the 20th of May, 1661, it was resolved that all the lords, who were members of the Church of England, should be at the cathedral of Christ-church by a certain hour, to receive the communion. Now, what was the meaning of this resolution, supposing that there were no lords, save those who were members of the Church of England, in the House? But on the 7th of June, 1661, a resolution was passed, which entirely removed all doubt upon the question; for it was then ordered, that all the lords who were members of the Church of England should, when they were absent from prayers, pay a fine of Is.; and that all the lords who were Roman Catholics should, if absent a quarter of an hour after prayers, were ended, also pay a fine of Is. Now, after these entries upon the Journals of the Irish Houses of parliament, could any man. doubt that the Roman Catholics were accustomed to sit there as members down to the reign of Charles 2nd? If, then, they enjoyed that privilege up to that time, could any man pretend to argue, that when the Treaty of Limerick secured to the Catholics-all such privileges as they enjoyed in the reign of Charles 2nd, it was not violated; when the privilege of sitting in parliament was taken from them? It was said, however, that the Treaty of Limerick was only intended to protect the Irish inhabitants of the city and county of Limerick, and the adjoining counties. But there was evidence to rebut that notion, which he thought would have great weight with gentlemen on the other side of the House. The evidence to which he alluded was that of bishop Burnett, who was, as every body knew, deep in the confidence of king, William. Bishop Burnett, in that part of his work which related to the Treaty of-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0508"/>
<col>1001</col>
Limerick, used these expressions:&#x2014;"Those of Limerick treated not only for themselves, but for all the rest of their countrymen that were yet in arms. They were all indemnified and restored to all that they had enjoyed in king Charles's time. They were also admitted to all the privileges of subjects upon their taking the oaths of allegiance to their majesties, without being bound to take the Oath of Supremacy." He would here state, that the Irish oath of allegiance was not like that taken in England, coupled with the Oath of Supremacy; and in the 9th article of the Treaty of Limerick, it is distinctly stated, that the oath to be administered to such Roman Catholics as submit to their Majesties' government, shall be the Oath of Allegiance and no other.&#x2014;He would here state, that if it were necessary to adduce further proof that Roman Catholics had seats in the parliament of Ireland previously to the Treaty of Limerick, it was to be found in the letters of lord Orrery, and in the memoirs of colonel Allardyce. The latter gentleman, who was an Englishman, and had resided for upwards of twenty-five years in Ireland, had left behind him a list of the peers who sat in the parliament of 1681, and had placed the names of the Protestants in one column and those of the Catholics in the other. In the list of Roman Catholics were seven earls, and several viscounts, two of whom, lords Louth and Iveah, had been actually given as hostages by the Catholics to king William in return for colonel Coutts, and three or four other English people, who had been given as hostages by king William to the Catholics for the due observation of the suspension of hostilities during the negotiation preceding the Treaty of Limerick, which lasted from the 27th of September, 1692, to the 4th of October in the same year. The length of the negotiation, added to the fact that the garrison would not sign the Treaty, till the justices had come from Dublin to examine it, was a proof that the garrison were particularly anxious that the Treaty should be worded in an accurate legal form. He might also say, that king William had himself shown great anxiety on obtaining the execution of this Treaty; for, on his receiving the intelligence of it, which Ginckle sent express to him in Ireland, the Tower guns were fired, and other symptoms of joy exhibited for the entire settlement of the kingdom, as he believed it was at that time called in the
<col>1002</col>
Gazette. He must apologize to the House for the length of time which he had intruded upon its attention. He had made no appeal to their passions, because he conceived that such appeals were rarely calculated to produce conviction on subjects of this nature; but he would venture to implore them, by all that was dear to man, not to lose sight of the present condition of Ireland. It was idle to suppose that things could remain in that country in their present situation. No country was so terrible to live in as Ireland. He should always be prepared to support the Protestant establishments of that country; but he would rather be hacked in pieces himself, and see his children mangled round him, than forswear his hostility to the Penal-laws which oppressed his Catholic fellow-subjects. The country had recently been told, that those laws were to be continued. Scarcely had the tocsin of that annunciation been sounded in Ireland, before the Roman Catholics met peaceably and simultaneously in every parish within its confines, and immediately on their being called to pay the tax levied upon them for the expense of getting up petitions for the repeal of those laws, the Catholic rent rose from 40<i>l.</i> and 50<i>l.</i> a week, to 800<i>l.</i> in the first week, 600<i>l.</i> in the second, and 500<i>l.</i> in the third. He repeated it, scarcely had the triumvirate, which recently acceded to the Cabinet, got safely into their seats, before the Catholic rent swelled 5,000<i>l.</i> in amount. Could a system which produced such effects on the population of a whole country, last much longer? Was it not mischievous in the highest degree? Was it not calculated to impair and destroy the attachment which ought to subsist between England and Ireland? He should not trouble the House further at present, as another opportunity would shortly arise in which he could give his opinion more fully on the subject of Catholic Emancipation. He trusted that, when that opportunity should arrive, hon. gentlemen would sacrifice their differences of opinion on the altar of their country, and would permit the incense of their harmony to ascend to heaven as a propitiation to their God for the offences they had committed against their fellow-countrymen.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1003</col>
temperate, dispassionate, and conciliatory consideration of the claims which the Roman Catholics had under the Treaty of Limerick. He would not be provoked by the example of the hon. gentleman to travel out of the record then before the House. He would rather pursue the course which had been recommended by the hon. baronet in originating this motion, and would postpone to another opportunity an examination of the legitimate import of the wording of that Treaty: for he agreed with him in thinking, that if that Treaty was to be discussed on a future opportunity, the most expedient course for hon. members to take would be to move for the production of the Treaty now, and to reserve their sentiments upon it until the period of the promised discussion. When he came into the House that night, he was perfectly prepared to acquiesce in the motion of the hon. baronet. He had no objection whatever to the production of the Treaty, and if the hon. baronet had moved for it without adding a word, he should have acquiesced in the motion with equal silence. But whilst he made that statement, he was obliged by the speech of the hon. member for Dublin to add, that having studied very carefully the words of the Treaty, and having referred very industriously to the construction put upon it in the works of cotemporary writers, he had come to a decided conviction that no privilege was at present withdrawn from the Catholics, which they had the power to claim under that Treaty. He was ready at any time to discuss that question temperately and dispassionately; but he must say, that, having resorted with great diligence to all the cotemporary sources of in ormation, he was convinced, not that the Treaty of Limerick had not been violated by the statute of queen Anne&#x2014;but that the privileges which were now claimed for the Roman Catholics could not be demanded as a matter of right under that Treaty. The hon. gentleman had said, that certain persons were inclined to consider that Treaty out of date, owing to the length of time which had elapsed since its ratification, and to argue that whatever might have been the stipulations of it at the time, the Roman Catholics of the present day had no right to claim any benefit from them. Now, he would frankly declare that, if any such persons did exist, he was not one of them. He did not mean to say that no reference ought to be made to the political considerations which might have grown up
<col>1004</col>
since the ratification of that Treaty and that an over-ruling necessity might not have justified parliament in deviating from the strict sense of its stipulations. His view of the question of Catholic emancipation would certainly be altered, if he could bring himself to believe that the Roman Catholics had resigned certain advantages, which they held at the time of signing that Treaty, upon the faith of receiving others which were now withheld from them. In resorting to that treaty, he thought that the real question which the House had to decide was simply this&#x2014;were the Roman Catholics admitted by it to seats in parliament? The hon. gentleman had referred to two articles in the Treaty of Limerick,&#x2014;the first and the ninth,&#x2014;which he says opens to the Roman Catholics of Ireland all the privileges which they had in the reign of Charles the 2nd, upon their submitting to take the Oath of Allegiance, "I am surprised," said Mr. Peel, "that the right hon. gentleman should say, that by the terms of the ninth article, it was evidently the intention of king William to leave the privileges of the constitution as open to the Roman Catholics as to the Protestants of Ireland. The first article is couched in these terms:&#x2014;'The Roman Catholics of this kingdom shall enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their religion, as are consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of king Charles 2nd; and their Majesties, as soon as their affairs will permit them to summon 3 parliament in this kingdom, will endeavour to procure the said Roman Catholics such further security in that particular, as may preserve them from any disturbances upon the account of their said religion.' And. the ninth article, on which the hon. gentleman also relies, is worded thus:&#x2014;'The oath to be administered to. such Roman, Catholics as submit to their Majesties' government, shall be the oath above said, meaning the Oath of Allegiance, 'and no other.' Now, to what class of persons do these two articles refer? Not to the whole Catholic population of Ireland, but to those persons mentioned in. the second article) who should submit to take the Oath of Allegiance to his majesty's government. And what are the terms of the second article? That ' all the inhabitants or residents of Limerick, or any other garrison now in the possession of the Irish, and all officers and soldiers now in arms under any commission of king James or those authorised; by him
<image src="S2V0018P0I0510"/>
<col>1005</col>
to grant the same, in tire several counties of Limerick, Clare, Kerry, Cork, and Mayo, or any of them [and all such as are under their protection in the said counties,] and all the commissioned officers in their majesties quarters that belong to the Irish regiments now in being, that are treated with, and who are not prisoners of war, or have taken protection, and who shall return and submit to their majesties' obedience, and their and every of their heirs, shall hold, possess, and enjoy all and every their estates of freehold and inheritance, and all the rights, titles, interests, privileges, and immunities, which they and every or any of them held, enjoyed, or were rightfully and lawfully entitled to in the reign of king Charles 2nd, or at any time since by the laws and statutes that were in force in the said reign of king Charles 2nd.' And then follows, as I before stated, the ninth article, which states the oath that shall be administered to those who seek to obtain these immunities. Now, I ask the hon. baronet, whether it is possible for him to contend, upon the language of those articles, that all the Roman Catholics of Ireland are to be admissible to seats in parliament, on merely taking the Oath of Allegiance? If it be, as he contends, what reason does he give for the government of king William inserting an article in the Treaty which should place the Roman Catholics of Ireland even on a more favourable footing than their Protestant countrymen? But it is quite plain that the version which the hon. baronet has put upon these articles cannot be correct; for what says the 7th article of the Treaty? 'Every nobleman and gentleman comprised in the said second and third article shall have liberty to ride with a sword and case of pistols, if they shall think fit; and keep a gun in their houses for the defence of the same, or for fowling.' Is it possible to suppose that such an article could have been introduced into the Treaty, if it had been intended to admit every nobleman and gentleman, to a seat in parliament, on his merely taking the Oath of Allegiance? Now, let me ask the House to look at the state of Ireland at that time; for as this is a question of dry law, and unconnected' with political considerations, we may look at it without any of that warm political feeling which intrudes itself too often in spite of ourselves into Our debates, when we look at the present state of Ireland. It is argued, that it was intended fey; the first article of the treaty of Limerick
<col>1006</col>
to admit all Catholics into parliament on taking the Oath of Allegiance. Now I think that there is sufficient evidence to shew that neither of the contracting parties to the Treaty of Limerick, contemplated the possibility of admitting Roman Catholics into parliament. For, as I asked before, what was then the condition of Ireland? The treaty was signed in 1691, and a parliament had been sitting in Dublin, under the authority of king James in the latter part of 1689. I will not ask of what description were the? acts of that parliament, for I wish not to introduce any irritating topics into the debate but I will ask of what persons did it consist? It consisted of 241 members; it sat for two years, and during all that time it had only six protestants in its numbers. Now, is it possible to conceive, that with the experience of that parliament before him, king William would have been so impolitic as to allow Roman Catholics to sit in parliament, upon such terms as the hon. baronet has represented? It seems too great an absurdity to suppose that, when the Roman Catholics had for some time been excluded from parliament by the Oath of Supremacy, a matter of such importance as their re-admission to it would be settled at once without any discussion, and under such a general form of words as that 'they shall enjoy such Privileges in the exercise of their Religion as are consistent with the laws of Ireland.' Why did not the Roman Catholics, with all th6 legal talent which they had at their command&#x2014;for sir Toby Butler was with them at Limerick &#x2014;get the words ' political privileges' inserted in the Treaty, supposing that king William was willing td grant them such extensive political privileges as were now claimed for them? Why did they not insert some form of words which would have avoided all cavil as to the extent of their privileges, re-fleeting, as they must have done, on this importance of having them clearly and positively defined? &#x2014;But I have another reason for saying that the possession of such privileges, as were now asked for them, was never in the contemplation of the Roman Catholics of Limerick. Does the hon. baronet recollect the terms on which they insisted previously to the signing of the Treaty? The House will, perhaps, excuse me for shortly recapitulating them. Previously to the capitulation of Limerick, the Roman Catholics sent a proposal for a cessation of arms to general
<image src="S2V0018P0I0511"/>
<col>1007</col>
Ginckle. It was granted. The next day they submitted their proposals to him in the seven propositions following:&#x2014;'1st. That their Majesties will, by an act of Indemnity, pardon all past offences whatever; 2nd. All Irish Catholics to be restored to the estates of which, they were seized or possessed before the late Revolution; 3rd. To allow free liberty of religious worship, and one priest to each parish, as well in towns and cities as in the country; 4th. Irish Catholics to be capable of holding all employments, civil and military under the Crown, and of exercising all trades, professions, and callings whatsoever; 5th. The Irish army to be kept on foot, and received in their present condition into their Majesties' service, in case they be willing to serve their Majesties against France or any other enemy; 6th. The Irish Catholics to be at liberty to reside in cities and towns corporate, to be members of corporations, and to exercise all corporate franchises and immunities; 7th. An act of Parliament to be passed for ratifying and confirming these conditions.'&#x2014;Now I think it is quite evident that the conditions which the Roman Catholics then asked for are by no means equal in importance to those which the Roman, baronet says were granted to them by the 9th article of the Treaty which was subsequently concluded. And what does the House suppose was general Ginckle's answer to them? The propositions submitted to him were so extravagant that he refused to grant them. He said that, though he was almost a Stranger to the Jaws of England, he could see that they were equally inconsistent with those laws and his own honour. Having rejected them for these reasons, he ordered a new battery to be erected against the town, and at the same time sent in twelve propositions to the besieged, stating that he would grant them those terms and no others. The hon. gentleman opposite has said something about additions made to the Treaty on its ratification by king William, of which I heard for the first time this night with a very considerable degree of surprise. I shall say nothing upon it at present, except that I hope that this motion will include every syllable connected with this ratification. I wish that hon. gentlemen, before we come to the discussion of this Treaty, would read the argument of sir Toby Butler upon it. For they will then
<col>1008</col>
find, that, when sir Toby appeared in the year 1702, at the bar of the House of Commons, to argue against a bill which was then passing through it, he did not say one word respecting the injustice of excluding Roman Catholics from seats in parliament. At least such is my present belief. The House will find his argument at length in 'Plowden's History of Ireland;' and also in the ' Historical Apology for the Roman Catholics,' by Mr. William Parnell. The hon. gentleman opposite has referred to the authority of bishop Burnett, with the intention of showing that he conceived that the garrison of Limerick treated not only for themselves, but for all the rest of their countrymen who were in arms. He says that bishop Burnett was high in the confidence of king William, and that his testimony was most important on that particular point. I must here entreat the House to give me its attention whilst I state one fact In the year 1692, I think it was immediately after the ratification of the Treaty of Limerick, the Oath of Supremacy was required to be taken in the Irish parliament, by an act passed in the English parliament. I am not now called upon to say whether such an act was legal. All I say is, that it was acted upon in the Irish parliament. Bishop Burnett&#x2014;the very bishop whose testimony the hon. gentleman deems so conclusive&#x2014;with a full knowledge of that circumstance thus commences the third volume of his history&#x2014;'I now begin on the 1st of May 1705, to prosecute this work, and I have now before me the reign of king William and queen Mary.' He was therefore at that time perfectly well aware of the construction put upon the Treaty of Limerick, and the practice which prevailed under it. He states the manner in which the Roman Catholics had entered into that treaty, and then he proceeds, after the quotation which had been made imperfectly by the I hon. gentleman, to observe that ' the articles of the capitulation were perfectly and impartially executed, and that some doubts which had arisen out of the ambiguous manner in which the treaty was worded, had been explained in favour of the Irish Catholics.' That is the construction put upon the treaty by a person whose authority is declared by the hon. gentleman to be most cogent, because he was in the immediate confidence of William 3rd. If, then, the due execution of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0512"/>
<col>1009</col>
Treaty of Limerick is to be decided by the authority of bishop Burnett, we must conclude that the stipulations of it were faithfully executed, and that the ambiguous parts of it were explained in favour of the Irish Catholics.&#x2014;I am un-feignedly sorry, that the hon. baronet, who brought forward the motion, and also the hon. gentleman who seconded it, have entered at present into argument upon the construction of the Treaty; for the subject embraces topics, and is connected so closely with documents that appeared at the time of the treaty, that it is impossible to discuss it as we ought, without some previous deliberation. I have looked at the subject, at different times, with great interest and attention, because I wished to consider it fairly and impartially. From all I have read upon it, I have a strong impression on my mind, that at the time of signing the treaty, it was not in the contemplation of either of the contracting parties, that the Catholics should be allowed to claim under it admission into parliament, or into the high and efficient offices of the State. I admit that the passing of the Penal-laws was a violation of that treaty, and that if it were not justified by circumstances at the time, it was a violation for which no sufficient excuse could be alleged. But I say, at the same time, that no privilege is now withheld from the Roman Catholics of Ireland, which they have a right to claim in consequence of that treaty. That is the view which the Catholics took of their condition in 1793, when the first act was passed for their relief and benefit, and that is the view which I believe to be the correct one. I do not mean to say that the ancient date of the treaty is any bar to the faithful execution of it at this moment. If I were satisfied that the object of that treaty was to admit Roman Catholics into parliament on merely taking the Oath of Allegiance, I should be so far from thinking that the age of the treaty was of no avail, that I should permit it to have full influence on my judgment, whenever the Roman Catholics came to this House to ask for the fulfilment of their claims. I am, however, satisfied, by reference to cotemporary documents, that the Roman Catholics of Ireland have no claim upon us from the Treaty of Limerick; and that being my opinion, I shall not say one word on the general question, until it is brought regularly under our consideration."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00748"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> said, he claimed equal credit for sincerity with the right hon. gentleman, when he declared his firm belief in favour of a different construction from that which the right hon. gentleman had put upon the articles of this great national stipulation&#x2014;a treaty, not contracted, as lawyers would say, without a consideration, but which at once transferred to king William the full possession of the kingdom of Ireland. How happened it, that when the right hon. gentleman depended so much upon bishop Burnett's authority in behalf of his opinion that no violation of the treaty had taken place, he had overlooked the strong fact, that at the very time the bishop was writing, in 1705, some of those penal laws, which were infractions, had actually been enacted?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00749"><member>Mr. Peel.</member><membercontribution> &#x2014;"Bishop Burnett was, you know, only writing the history of William and Mary."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00750"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> said, that was true, but in point of date, the bishop was engaged in writing the work after 1704, when some of those penal acts had actually passed. That horrid act against the education of Catholic children &#x2014;the most wicked that ever disgraced a statute book &#x2014;had previously passed under the cognizance of bishop Burnett. Both the law and the fact were upon this point against the historian. But the bishop was good authority in another part of his work, where he spoke of the occurrence of direct facts under his own eye, and stated, in plain terms, that so intent was the government to obtain an end to the war in Ireland, that the commissioners were instructed to keep their terms in good faith (alluding to this very treaty), "to the no small grief," says Burnett, "of some English who wished to ruin the Irish for their own purposes." The passage in Burnett was as follows:&#x2014;"When they came to capitulate, the Irish insisted on very high demands, which were set on by the French, who hoped they would be rejected; but the king had given Ginckle secret directions that he should grant all the demands they could make that would put an end to the war. So every thing was granted, to the great disappointment of the French, and to the no small grief of some of the English, who hoped this war would have ended in the total ruin of the Irish interest. Those of Limerick treated not for themselves alone, but for all the rest of their countrymen who were yet in arms. They were
<image src="S2V0018P0I0513"/>
<col>1011</col>
indemnified, and restored to all that they had enjoyed in king Charles's time. They were also admitted to all the privileges of subjects upon their taking the oath of allegiance to their majesties without being bound to take the oath of supremacy." By the first article of the treaty of Limerick, or of Ireland as it was more properly described, the Catholics were restored to all the privileges which they had enjoyed in the time of Charles 2nd, to be admitted to all the privileges of all the other subjects, without taking any other oath except the Oath of Allegiance. All the privileges constituted a comprehensive description, and necessarily included the right of sitting in parliament&#x2014;a right subsequently and violently taken away, by the enactment which added two oaths to the qualification by the Oath of Allegiance. The articles in the Treaty were these:&#x2014;"1 The Roman Catholics of this kingdom shall enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their religion, as are consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of Charles 2nd, and their majesties, as soon as their affairs will permit them to summon a parliament, will endeavour to procure the said Roman Catholics such further security in that particular, as may preserve them from any disturbance upon the account of their said religion."&#x2014;"9. The oath to be administered to such Roman Catholics, as subjects to their majesties' government, shall be the oath aforesaid (of allegiance) and no other."&#x2014;He would here take the opportunity of referring to a curious tract which threw some additional light upon this subject. It was entitled "Great Britain's Just Complaint for late Measures and present Sufferings,'' a Jacobite tract, by W. J. Montgomery, printed by Ralph, and reprinted in Lord Somer's Tracts:&#x2014;"The prince has taken as. large and broad steps towards a dispensing power as any that can be charged on king James. The Irish treaty furnishes us with a convincing proof of this, where such indulgences were granted to them solely and singly by his own authority, with relation to the exercise of their religion, dispensation from oaths, &amp;c, as were directly contrary to the laws of the land/and the safety, rights, and privileges of the protestant subjects of that kingdom. This treaty I do acknowledge was afterwards ratified by parliament, but the new life commenceth only from the date of their sanction," "But," said the right hon.
<col>1012</col>
gentleman opposite, "did not the original rejection of the Irish proposals involve a striking contradiction of the supposed construction which was now contended for?" Certainly not; for what were the original propositions? The Irish proposals rejected by Ginckle were, free liberty of worship; Papists to be eligible to all employments civil and military; Irish army to be kept on foot and paid; corporations opened, and a public establishment of a priest for every parish. These were what Ginckle rejected; and surely they were very different from those for which the supporters of the Treaty of Limerick now contended.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00751"><member>Mr. Peel.</member><membercontribution> &#x2014;"No; what General Ginckle said, was, that these propositions were contrary to the laws of England."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00752"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> resumed and said, so it was, to have an Irish priest established in every parish: if he did not mistake, the right hon. gentleman had, on a former occasion said the same; and sure he was that the earl of Liverpool had made such a declaration, when the motion was made for assigning a stipend to the Catholic clergy. That noble earl had then said, that such a demand went to the overthrow of the Protestant religion, and to a breach of the coronation oath. Turning to the conduct of general Ginckle, it would be seen, that on the 1st of August, 1691, the government had addressed a letter to him, urging him, in the strongest terms to put an end to the war in Ireland. The letter from Coningsby to Ginckle, of the 1st of August, 1691, represented how absolutely necessary it was for the affairs of Christendom, that the war in Ireland should be ended this summer. He represented how averse people were generally from giving the Irish any conditions, but that such persons did not consider the misery of the country, and less understood the circumstances of affairs abroad. At that time there were two contending parties in the field-councils of the different armies. There were in the Irish camp a French party, urging them on to extreme demands; while with Ginckle there was an English party, insisting that the Irish should receive no terms short of confiscation. Between these two inflamed parties the Irish government were desirous of moderately mediating. "But," said the right hon. gentleman, "see the length of time which elapsed before any complaint of this kind was made respecting the alleged in-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0514"/>
<col>1013</col>
fraction of the Treaty." To this assertion he would reply, that so far from no complaint having been made, the very earliest opportunity when a question arose was taken by sir Toby Butler and sir Stephen Rice, when the privileges secured by the Treaty were denied to the Catholics. Sir Toby Butler was heard against the clauses of the act prescribing the declaration and oath of abjuration contrary to the 9th article, and he said, that "the 15th prevented Catholics from voting for members of parliament unless they take the oath of abjuration, which to oblige them to is contrary to the Limerick articles, which says that the Oath of Allegiance and no other shall be imposed on them. And if there was no law in force in the reign of Charles 2nd against these things as there certainly was not, and if the Catholics have not since forfeited, as for certain they have not, these clauses are against the articles, and a violation of the public faith." This was an answer, and a complete one to the right hon. gentleman's statement, that they had made no complaint fresh upon the infraction of the Treaty. If there was no law, as there certainly was not, in the reign of Charles 2nd, to exclude Catholics from parliament, and if they had not since, as was equally clear, forfeited their rights under this Treaty, then the case was clear in their behalf, and the articles of the Treaty had been violated. This doctrine had, he repeated, been broached at the bar of that wicked parliament which had violated the immutable principles of justice, as well as the solemn faith of treaties. Notwithstanding such a departure from right and law, the speech of counsel remained on record as a protest against the injustice. The right hon. gentleman said, why did not the Irish at the time appeal to the English throne, or parliament? Who ever heard of the voice of the weak and the prostrate being raised against the strong in the zenith of their power? and to whom could they have appealed? To that parliament who had heard Molineux's celebrated book ordered, to be burnt, who had voted the Irish linen trade a nuisance. To the parliament of Ireland he had shewn they had already appealed. Was it to king William, whose situation was so difficult at the time, that he could scarcely venture to do justice to the Catholics of Ireland without encouraging the Jacobites in England, who were seeking to sap the foundation of his throne? William's govern
<col>1014</col>
ment was not then powerful enough to enable him to consult in this particular instance his feelings of justice. The government of William was well described by Somerville, as composed of persons associated in administration, and placed in responsible offices, but alienated from each other by former animosities, and actuated by incompatible interests, they entered not into any previous concert, and often differed publicly in opinion. Hence arose procrastination, inconsistency, and feebleness, in the executive branches of government. "Potestne in tam diversis mentibus pax aut amicitia esse?" He hoped there was no government subsisting at this time deserving the same character. For if there were, neither the English, the Irish, nor any other class of his majesty's subjects, could expect any very strong or useful measure to emanate from their hands. He was as ready as the right hon. gentleman to praise many of the great names who had figured in king William's government. The master of the Mint, for instance, of that monarch was the illustrious sir Isaac Newton. Still, that government was paralyzed and perplexed by contending difficulties, and compelled to be neutral in many instances where they ought to have been more just. He had trespassed thus long upon their attention, from his deliberate conviction, that his construction of the Treaty of Limerick was the only just one. One of his own ancestors had been engaged in preparing it, and his fellow-countrymen claimed the fair benefit of so solemn an enactment. Respecting the Oath of Supremacy, he begged to say a few words. That oath was never enjoined to be taken, according to any law, by any member of the Irish parliament. Resolutions of the Houses had been certainly voted, but these in themselves did not constitute law. In the reign of Charles 2nd, the parliament had nothing at heart so much as the exclusion of Catholics. On the 14th of May, 1661, a committee was appointed to consider how the oaths of allegiance and supremacy may be taken by all who are or may be hereafter members of this House. On the 15th May, 1661, a committee was appointed to attend the lords justices to pray the issue of a commission to administer the Oath of Supremacy. On the 21st of May, 1661, a committee was appointed to request the primate to appoint persons to administer the sacrament to the members
<image src="S2V0018P0I0515"/>
<col>1015</col>
of the House. On the 3rd of March, 1662, a committee sat to prepare the heads of a bill disenabling members to serve in parliament that shall not take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and also heads of a bill against popish hierarchy; and on the 17th of March, 1662, heads of a bill against popish hierarchy, were reported singly; also English laws against popery referred to a committee. On the 10th of April, 1663, major Ormsby reported the heads of a bill enjoining oaths of supremacy and allegiance; and there followed a petition to the duke of Ormond, that the provision made by law, in England, hath tended to the preservation of the peace, &amp;c.; and that since the government is the same, the necessities of both the same, the reasons of state the same, and such as doth require the same laws; in consideration whereof we offer to your Grace the heads of a bill declaring who shall take the Oath of Supremacy. On the 21st of May, 1663, the prorogation continued to the 26th of October, 1665; and in August, 1666, the parliament was dissolved. So that up to the declaratory law of 1782, none of these acts had received the sanction which was necessary to make them binding. It was a curious thing to find the Irish parliament endeavouring to enforce an English statute as binding, while they were at the very time inquiring what other laws of England were fit to be re-enacted: thus, in the one case, adopting, as a matter of course, to serve a particular passion, what in the other they were determined only to have after it had received their own legislative sanction. He concurred with the right hon. gentleman in wishing that there existed any great legal tribunal before which this case of the Treaty of Limerick could be tried. If any man doubted the construction for which he contended in behalf of his country, let him consider the relative positions of the parties who were at the time engaged in the conflict. The one the weaker party, who had, with honourable and scrupulous fidelity, fulfilled its hard terms, though at the very moment had they agreed to this fulfilment, a French reinforcement had arrived in the river with succour: yet, notwithstanding this solemn adherence to their plighted faith, at the same moment a prelate was found, from the pulpit of a church in Dublin, to inveigh against keeping faith with the Irish, because they kept no faith themselves. It was always a principle in the construction of treaties, that they
<col>1016</col>
should be construed in favour of the weaker party; he appealed to the British parliament to give the descendants of those who had so faithfully observed their part of the stipulations the benefit of their contract. He appealed to that great military captain who was at the head of the present Administration, and who was conversant with treaties made in the field, for his aid in doing justice to his fellow countrymen. From the days of king William to the present the violation of this Treaty had been complained of, and he, lastly, implored justice for those to whom it had been so long denied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00753"><member>Mr. G. Moore</member><membercontribution> said, he did not mean, in discussing this question, to inquire whether the Treaty had been punctually fulfilled, but he would view it as <i>res integra</i> as if it were a question coming for the first time before the House. He would not consider it as a question for a jury, nor would he decide it by any strict and technical construction; but would view it as a great political question, which it was competent to judge, not by the literal meaning of the words, but with reference to the intentions of the parties. He would first call the attention of the House to that part of the subject on which so triumphant an answer had been given by his right hon. friend, as to the ninth article, by which it was provided, that all the Roman Catholics who submitted to king William should take the Oath of Allegiance, and no other. He contended that, if the provisions of the Treaty had been so extensive as the hon. gentleman who spoke last, and the hon. baronet, were disposed to contend, it would have been wholly unnecessary to make additional provisions for those numerous classes of Catholics whose situation was particularised and provided for in the other articles of the Treaty. If the provisions of the articles to which he alluded were so extensive, then he must say, that the provisions of the second article, granting to all trades, professions, and callings of the Catholics the free use and enjoyment of their respective rights, must be considered wholly superfluous, if the parties themselves were of opinion that they came fairly within the operation of the ninth article. The hon. gentleman then proceeded to argue, that the whole of the articles, notwithstanding all that was said to the contrary, must be considered as referring solely to religious liberty, and not to political privileges. In support of this opinion
<image src="S2V0018P0I0516"/>
<col>1017</col>
he read an extract from the journal of the rev. George Storey, in which were to be found the provisions of an amnesty proposed by the lords justices to the Irish, several years before the Treaty of Limerick, and which amnesty, it was observed, contained all the provisions afterwards granted under the formal Treaties of Limerick and Galway. The hon. member concluded by observing, that he had carefully abstained from touching upon any subject which could excite any feelings of irritation. He had merely argued the question with reference to the general understanding upon historical documents. Of these documents he took a very strong view, and he most earnestly hoped, that the hon. baronet would see the propriety of moving for a copy of the Declaration of the Justices of Ireland at the time to which he alluded, in addition to the copy of the Treaty of Limerick.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00754"><member>Mr. A. Dawson</member><membercontribution> said, he could not avoid saying a few words in reply to the right hon. Secretary. That right hon. gentleman had observed, that the parliament of James the 2nd was composed exclusively of Catholics, to the number of two hundred and forty members. That parliament afterwards attainted all the Protestants in Ireland, and confiscated their estates. Nothing, however, could be more absurd than to argue that a parliament, elected afterwards in Ireland, was likely to be composed wholly of Catholics. On the contrary the boroughs and counties of Ireland, which were settled as protestant, and in which the protestants had a preponderance, were so numerous that the parliament must have afterwards had a clear majority, both in the House of Lords and Commons. It appeared, indeed, by a work of a colonel Lawrence, that in the year 1680, there were seventy-nine Protestant peers in Ireland, and only thirty-two Catholic. When, therefore, the contending parties negociated at Limerick, there could not have been any fear of the consequences from the granting political privileges to the Roman Catholics. No danger could possibly have been apprehended from the predominant influence of the Catholics in the-parliament of Ireland. That question, indeed, never came before Ginckle, because BO such idea ever entered the heads of those who were called upon to negociate. It was true that the conditions first proposed to Ginckle were returned, because they were inadmissible; but other conditions
<col>1018</col>
were afterwards allowed, not much worse than those originally offered. Ginckle, however, was a Dutchman, and knew too well how to drive a bargain, to accept the first proposition which was offered him. It was absurd, however, to say, that these conditions had any reference to seats in parliament. Offices civil and military were mentioned, but then it was well known, that civil and military offices did not comprehend seats in parliament. Seats in parliament were not mentioned, because the Irish knew they had that privilege already. Ginckle knew it too. He knew that the Protestants had a majority in the House of parliament, and he knew that there was no danger to the Protestants from the Catholics continuing to sit in that parliament. There was another point upon which he wished to say a few words. The right hon. gentleman had not attempted to account for that most remarkable resolution of the lords upon the subject of prayers. All Protestant peers were compelled to attend by 10 o'clock to hear prayers, under the pain of forfeiting a shilling; but, as they knew the Catholics could not attend these prayers, a certain time, a few minutes or so, was allowed them to attend under the forfeiture of another shilling. Now, if there were no Catholic peers in the House, what was the meaning, of that resolution? It could be considered as little better than a mere Irish blunder, to make resolutions apply to Catholics, if no Catholics were members of their lordships' House. The right hon. gentleman had observed upon the fact of gentlemen being allowed to carry a carbine and pistols; but that referred solely to the officers of the army, and not to Catholic gentlemen in general. The hon. member then proceeded to refer to the assertion, that the terms of the Treaty of Limerick had been strictly complied with, and admitted that they had been punctually adhered to, because the Catholics were allowed to sit in parliament; and this he took to be one great reason why no mention of the matter was to be found in the speech of sir Toby Butler at the bar of the House of Lords. That speech referred only to some particular infringement of the Treaty; and sir Toby, beside that he had no reason to speak to the point of seats in parliament, well knew that he would have been stopped by the lord Chancellor, if he had attempted to enter upon a branch of the question which was not contained in the petition

he appeared to support. If any of these things could raise a doubt in the mind of the right hon. gentleman, he had expressed a determination to give the question further consideration; and it was to be hoped, that if such doubts were once raised, the right hon. gentleman would allow his doubts to incline to that side which was favourable to the people of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SCOTCH LAW OF ENTAIL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00756"><member>Mr. Kennedy</member><membercontribution>, in moving for leave to bring in a bill to alter and amend the Scotch Law of Entail, expressed his determination, in the amendments he had to propose, to consult, as far as he possibly could, the feelings and the prejudices of the Scotch Aristocracy. The statute he wished to amend, was of very ancient date. It was passed in the year 1685. By its provisions, the owner of the fee simple of an estate in Scotland was enabled to limit the succession by a series of entails through ages. Possessing the fee simple, he had the power to name his unborn heirs, and to settle the succession to his property through a series of ages, without the possibility of any future possession altering the nature or terms of the entail. The consequences of this extended nature of entail were most injurious to all the transactions of society: for when all other properties were found liable to debts contracted by their proprietors, the owners of entailed estates found their possessions exempt from any obligations. A record was kept of the entails settled according to this statute, and he had procured a return of the numbers of properties which had been progressively entailed, through periods of twenty years, in order to shew how rapidly they were increasing, and how injurious that increase must prove to the prosperity of the kingdom. In the first forty years there were 313 estates entailed: in the next period of twenty years there were sixty-nine; in the next 138; in the next 272; then 360; then 459; and in the last period there were 54: making in the whole, 1,645 estates entailed under the statute, besides a vast number of other properties left in the hands of trustees for the same purpose. It was a fact worthy of notice, that large quantities of English capital were gradually finding their way to Scotland, in order to its being placed under the security of the same restrictions, tending to increase the evil, and
<col>1020</col>
to produce a still greater mischief&#x2014;a numerous absentee aristocracy. It might, indeed, fairly be said, that one half of all the landed property of Scotland was at that moment placed under the system of entail permitted by the statute of 1685; and he might venture to predict, that, if some check was not speedily applied, the whole of the landed property of that country would soon be placed in the same condition. The owners of estates entailed in this manner found their properties, as he before observed, free from the obligations imposed upon others; and it was, therefore, not unnatural to suppose that many of them looked upon their creditors in a very different light from that in which they must regard them if their properties were settled in the ordinary manner. The hon. gentleman went on to contend, that this statute produced a state of things very uncongenial with the opinions of the times in which we lived, and calculated to retard the progress of improvement. In England an estate, it was true, might be entailed to a certain extent, but when the son came of age, the father might come to an understanding with him for their mutual benefit, and cut off that entail. In Scotland no such good understanding could prevail between the father and the son; and this want of harmony in families was one of the evils resulting from the system which he proposed to alter. Scotland had, of late years, made rapid strides towards improvement; but great as that improvement had been, it must have been much greater had not the peculiar nature of these entails presented an obstacle to the proper exertions of speculators upon the large tracts of waste land which it contained. In 1757, lord Hardwicke addressed himself to lord Kaimes, one of the ablest lawyers who ever lived in Scotland. Lord Hardwicke expressed his entire concurrence in the opinion entertained by lord Kaimes, as to the evils of the law of entail in Scotland, which had the effect of quite locking up the property in that country. In 1764 an act was passed upon this subject, and in 1770 another act was passed with the view of making some improvements, but which was attended with great confusion and inconvenience. Again, in 1824, a statute was introduced, which was brought forward with the best feelings, and for the best purposes. By that statute, a small part of the estate was made liable to certain contingencies, but it was not pas-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0518"/>
<col>1021</col>
sible for the heir, under any circumstances, to alienate the greater portion of it; and; whatever might be the demands upon it, two thirds of the estate were strictly preserved by the law of entail. He would for the present merely state the general object of his bill, which was to alter and amend the law of entail. The proposition upon this subject 'did not originate with him. It was one earnestly recommended in a very able work published by Mr. Irvine. The idea of the necessity of altering and amending the law upon entail was also strongly recommended in an admirable book upon the subject, by an eminent lawyer, Mr. Simpson. A disposition towards such an alteration prevailed throughout Scotland. It was upon such authority as he had cited, that he had undertaken this business. He wished it to be understood, that in any alteration which he might propose, he intended to make an exemption in favour of the aristocracy of Scotland. He would make this concession to what some might consider the prejudices of the aristocracy that no fine should be levied, or recovery suffered, which would cut off the entail, by which estates were transmitted in the families of the aristocracy. Indeed he was anxious that any change which he might be instrumental in introducing should not affect the natural interests of any individuals. He would not make the improved law of entail, obligatory upon any persons. Those who wished to abide by the present system of the strict law of entail, would be at liberty to do so, but then he wished that a freer and more unrestricted system should be introduced, for the benefit of those who might wish to avail themselves of it. He would not propose a sudden and compulsory measure, but make it voluntary and gradual, and thereby render the adopting of it more generally acceptable. The hon. gentleman concluded by moving, "That leave be given to bring in a bill to alter and amend the Law of Entail in Scotland."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00757"><member>The Lord Advocate</member><membercontribution> said, he did not object to the manner in which the hon. member proposed to bring the subject before the consideration of the House, as during its progress the country would have an opportunity of expressing its opinion on this important measure. It was the more necessary to give the country this opportunity, as it was the obvious tendency of the bill to do away with entails entirely
<col>1022</col>
in Scotland. [No, no&#x0021; from Mr. Kennedy.] He could not see what other tendency the giving every heir the power of disentailing one third of his entailed estates could have; for thus, in the course of three successions, the whole of an entailed estate might be alienated. He thought the people of Scotland were not prepared for so violent a measure. If the bill had given the power of disentailing the whole estate at once, he did not think there would have been much opposition to it, as there were few who would ever think of doing such a thing. With respect to extending the operations of the bill to the present holders of entailed property, he thought there would be muck objection to it, on account of the interests of the presumptive heirs, which were bound up in the present law. Indeed, he did not think the holders themselves would go along with his hon. friend in his views.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00758"><member>Mr. Sugden</member><membercontribution> thought, that any change which would affect the statute of 1685, by which the real property of Scotland was settled and established, would be productive of much inconvenience and litigation. He would not say that the law of entail in Scotland was not susceptible of improvement; nor would he advocate the expediency of strict entail: on the contrary, in this commercial country, he thought that property should be comparatively open; whilst a due regard should be held for the principle of non-alienation, for the preservation of property in families, and the other salutary purposes for which it was instituted. Much litigation and confusion ensued from many parts of the law affecting real property and its entailment in Scotland; but that confusion would, in his opinion, be only increased by any precipitate interference with the principal on which entail property, consisting as it did of nearly half the whole property of Scotland, was settled.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00759"><member>The Attorney General</member><membercontribution>, recommended the dividing the proposed measure into two distinct branches, the prospective and retrospective.

<title>SLAVERY IN THE WEST INDIES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00762"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, that before he proceeded to enter on the motion which stood for that evening, he felt it necessary to make an observation with respect to some circumstances that had recently occurred. Yesterday a conversation arose on a petition being presented relative to the situation of negroes in the colonies, and the learned member for Winchelsea then made several observations which he had declared his intention of answering when he brought forward the motion of which he had given notice. The learned gentleman had then requested him to put off the discussion until seven o'clock this evening; and afterwards the learned gentleman wished him to postpone it altogether. He was obliged to notice this, because many gentlemen were anxious that the discussion should come on immediately. He, however, would be guided by the feeling of the House [cries of "go on."] The motion, then, which he meant to propose to the House was, "that the minutes of evidence taken before his majesty's privy council, in the matter of the Demerara and Berbice manumission order in council, be laid before this House." And he felt it to be his duty to call the attention of the House to those circumstances which induced him to consider such a course as highly expedient. He begged it to be distinctly understood, that the step he was taking was not in the slightest degree influenced by any communications with the members of his majesty's government. He, as a privy councillor, attended the original investigation, and, in the performance of his duty as a member of parliament, he now brought the question forward. Gentlemen were aware, that in May 1823, certain resolutions were passed in that House, which pledged the House to pursue a certain course of policy with respect to slaves. The resolution which was then proposed by the hon. member for Weymouth (Mr. F. Buxton) set forth, "that the state of slavery is repugnant to the principles of the British constitution, and of the Christian religion; and that it ought to be gradually abolished throughout the British colonies, with as much expedition as may be found consistent with a due regard to the well-
<col>1024</col>
being of the parties concerned." That resolution was rejected by the House, and the following resolutions were substituted:&#x2014;"1. That it is expedient to adopt effectual and decisive measures for ameliorating the condition of the slave-population in his majesty's colonies. 2. That through a determined and persevering, but at the same time judicious and temperate enforcement of such measures, this House looks forward to a progressive improvement in the character of the slave-population, such as may prepare them for a participation in those civil rights and privileges which are enjoyed by other classes of his majesty's subjects. 3. That this House is anxious for the accomplishment of this purpose, at the earliest period that shall be compatible with the well-being of the slaves themselves, with the safety of the colonies, and with a fair and equitable consideration of the interests of private property."&#x2014;The House were aware of the-effects which these resolutions produced; and it was necessary, if gentlemen wished to be able to judge of the extreme delicacy of the situation in which that House and the government were now placed with reference to these resolutions, that they should look minutely at all that had occurred since they were passed. If gentlemen felt an "interest in the well-being of the slaves themselves," and were anxious, while they furthered that well-being, for "the fair and equitable consideration of the interests of private property," they would attend, for once, to that series of circumstances which led to the present state of things in the colonies. He begged leave to read the prayer of the memorial which had been laid before his majesty in council, from Demerara and Berbice. The memorialists prayed "that your majesty will be pleased not to send forth any order in council for the manumission of slaves, until your majesty shall be graciously pleased to hear the appellants by their counsel." He wished to call the attention of the House most particularly to the clause for compulsive manumission. That clause arose thus:&#x2014;After the resolutions of 1823, pledging the government to a specific course, and pledging the House to look to the well-being of the slave as well as to the interests of his master, were passed, lord Bathurst, in the month of July, sent out to the colonies a certain despatch, and he directed those to whom it was addressed, to adopt measures in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0520"/>
<col>1025</col>
furtherance of the instructions contained in that despatch. In that paper, however, no allusion whatever was made to compulsory manumission: but the governor of Trinidad, sir Ralph Woodford, was told that all the matters contained in it were sanctioned by the government, and by the West-India body resident in England. Now, sir Ralph, in obedience to the orders of lord Bathurst, sent back to his majesty's privy council a draught of the Spanish law, as it existed in the colony of Trinidad. This was done, because Mr. Canning, when he brought forward his motion, in March, 1824, for the amelioration of the condition of the slaves, laid it down as wise and expedient, to gather all the laws with respect to slaves which were known in the West Indies, to concentrate them, and to make them part and parcel of the law by which the slave-population was to be governed and regulated. This clause for compulsory manumission being found to be part of the law of Trinidad, was included in the new code, of which it then formed a part. Mr. Canning had stated this. The law was laid on the table of that House, and the clause of compulsory manumission would be found in it, with very little alteration from the law of Spain on that point. Now it was necessary to state to the House, that neither on the part of those gentlemen who were supposed to represent the slaves, nor on the part of those who, on the other hand, were supposed to represent the planters, had any opposition been given to this measure. No reclamation had been made with respect to it, on the part either of the abolitionists, or of the proprietors. But no sooner was it extended, or announced that it was to be extended, to Berbice and Demerara, than the court of policy there, combining and interweaving the Dutch law with it, put a wrong construction on it, expressed themselves hostile to it, and sent home a representation on the subject to the Secretary of State. They required that the law should either be modified or repealed altogether, and they declared that they could only submit to it on account of the overruling power, with regard to the colonies, which the mother country possessed. There had been laid on the table, from time to time, since that period, a series of voluminous despatches, bearing on this subject; but, though much information was contained in them, still no law had yet been passed,
<col>1026</col>
with respect to compulsory manumission, differing from that which sir Ralph Wood-ford had stated to be the Spanish law in the colony of Trinidad. What he wished to impress on the House was this,&#x2014;that neither the abolitionists, nor their opponents here were perfectly aware of the consequences of that law, or of the very different situation in which the colony was placed in 1823, when the law was promulgated, compared with former times. And he would go the whole length of saying, that, if the abolitionists, as he had heard them declare in that House, meant to stand or fall by this law of Trinidad, they would find it wholly inoperative; they would find that it would not provide for the well-being of the slave, or for the private interest of his master. By the Spanish law, the slave, <i>invito domino</i>, might claim his right to manumission; and at a time when there was an unlimited market for slaves,&#x2014;when there were abundance of slaves in the Spanish colonies,&#x2014;the working of that law created no inconvenience or difficulty, because vacancies occasioned by the appeal of slaves to this <i>lex non scripta</i> (for that it was a law, no man could doubt, though it could not be traced to any distinct record) were easily supplied. The process was very simple. The slave went to his master and claimed his freedom. The latter employed an appraiser, who adjudged the price of the slave. The individual had then only to proceed to the market and purchase a slave of equal value. In the West Indies, even after the slave trade was done away, little inconvenience was felt from the operation of this law, in consequence of the large importation of slaves from islands, the soil of which was poor, into Trinidad. Now, he would show where the defects existed in the Trinidad order in council. By a clause in that order, it was required that the owner should receive a fair and just value for his slave; that in case of any dispute arising in the appraisement of the slave, the owner and the protector of slaves should each appoint a referee. Nothing could be more simple than this clause; but then it contained nothing to direct the principle on which the appraisers were to make their valuation. Where there could be a reference made to a market, there was no difficulty; but here was no market, and the principle of the appraisement ought therefore to be defined. The whole of this question, and the whole of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0521"/>
<col>1027</col>
difficulties connected with it, turned on one point; namely, the degree of probability of the owner being able to supply the place of his slave. In 1823, the country was deluged with assurances that it was the greatest of all mistakes to suppose that free labour would not be found as effectual as the labour of slaves in the cultivation of sugar. Although no one wished more heartily than himself that these assurances might prove true, he doubted their correctness. The event had proved that his doubts were not unfounded. To find out the manner in which this fact bore upon the general question, was his intention, and for that reason he had been induced to move for the production of these papers. The measure resolved on was, that the appraiser should replace an equivalent to the slave removed on the estate of the owner. Now, there were great difficulties in putting this measure into practice. He freely admitted that the resolutions of that House in 1824, showed that the House looked forward to the slave-population arriving, by progressive stages, to a state of perfect freedom. But the House had also resolved, that this should be done with a fair and equitable consideration of the interests of private property; and here the difficulty was to be found. The master derived profit only by working his estate, and if the labour was abstracted from him, how could he obtain any profit,&#x2014;how could his interests be fairly and equitably considered? The whole difficulty turned on this:&#x2014;the market for slaves was limited, and the cultivation of sugar was carried on by a body of slaves, because it was necessary that the work should be continuous, that there should be no interruption, that the labourers should be available at all periods. Now, if free labour were introduced in the West Indies, the same effects would prevail as were seen in this country. The liberty which the labourer possessed here of working or refusing to work as he pleased, or as his necessities would allow, would attach also to the emancipated slave. Any gentleman who would investigate the evidence given on this subject would see that in this way a planter might be placed under such circumstances, that labour would be abstracted from him without his receiving an equivalent. All he was anxious about was, that the House should show that they understood these difficulties, that they did not legislate in ignor-
<col>1028</col>
ance, and that they might prove to the inhabitants of the colonies, that it was their wish to give a candid investigation of all the difficulties of the question before they legislated upon it finally. If the House rested upon the Trinidad order, they rested upon a law which was inoperative. To make a law, and not to point out the means by which it could be carried into effect, was unjust. It was a very great mistake to suppose that all slaves were to be estimated at an equal value. The large cultivator expected a larger return than the individual who cultivated less. The former having invested more fixed capital on his estate than the latter, the abstraction of the labour of the former was more detrimental to him than the abstraction of the labour of the latter would be to him. Suppose, in England, that there were two farms, on the one of which 12,000<i>l.</i> had been expended, and on the other only 1,000<i>l.</i>; then, although the labour on both might be equal, yet, if the labour were abstracted from both, the owner of the former would lose a great deal more than the owner of the latter, because he had laid out much more upon the estate which he was precluded from working. It had been suggested, that it would be a wise plan to purchase the children of slaves; but the same argument applied to this proposition. The man who had the greater proportion of fixed capital, would be more injured than the man who had the lesser portion, if they were both compelled to sell the children of their slaves at the same price. Notwithstanding these difficulties, he would not shrink from the avowal, that human ingenuity could devise no mediate course, no alternative between waiting for that length of time, which some witnesses had declared might be centuries, and compulsory manumission. Unless, indeed, they were prepared actually to purchase the whole of the property of the West-India Islands. Let the House, therefore, consider the difficulty in which they were placed. On the one hand, they were called upon to protect the interests of private property; on the other, to effect the freedom of the slaves. If gentlemen would condescend to look into this difficulty, and show the West-Indians that they were as anxious to secure their property to them, as they were to provide for the well-being of the slaves, they would be more likely to obtain the concurrence of the legislative
<image src="S2V0018P0I0522"/>
<col>1029</col>
power of the colonies in the measures which they might be inclined to adopt. He regretted that his learned friend, the member for Winchelsea (Mr. Brougham) was absent,&#x2014;not that any thing that he had said required his presence, or that of any other person; for he had invited no argument, he had merely invited the House and the country to investigate, in order that they might understand the difficulties which he had pointed out, and agree that these propositions ought to be modified. It was of paramount necessity, that the West-Indians should be convinced that the House had no desire to overlook their interests, while it insisted on measures of melioration. The learned member for Winchelsea had last night introduced the analogy of the silk trade, and had said that, upon the introduction of some late regulations, the persons engaged in that trade might as well have asked for compensation as the slave-owners. But he would point out to the House one plain reason which disposed of that sort of analogy altogether. The compensation claimed by the slave-owners was for property abstracted, and not a claim founded upon incident. In this country, if a canal were cut, or a street built, the interest of individuals was made to yield to the public interest; but then it was well known that the individuals always received a compensation. Now, the West-Indian had property which he could only work by means of slave-labour; and was he not, therefore, equally entitled to compensation, if deprived of that labour, as the man in this country was, who had his property destroyed, either by the building of a street or the construction of a canal? In either case, the compensation was for property abstracted, and not for loss accruing from incident. They never yet heard of people claiming a compensation, because a duty had been imposed upon any particular article. If a man who lived in Bond-street were to come forward and claim compensation because Regent-street had been built, he would very properly be laughed at; but a man who lived in Swallow-street, and whose house was pulled down to make way for Regent-street, had a claim for compensation, and his claim was allowed.&#x2014;The West-Indian must be insane, who would not rather employ free labour than slaves, if the former would answer his purpose; but then, he said, very fairly, "You are bound to shew me that there is a chance
<col>1030</col>
of free labour succeeding." As long as an equivalent slave could be produced to the master, not in theory, but in practice, there would be no inconvenience. The West-Indian did not complain of such a substitution. What he complained of was, that, in the letter of the law, the House had not followed the principles it had professed. It had been said, that this compensation could not be estimated in money. He could not agree in this. Indeed, he thought that there was no quality, either mental or corporeal, which, more or less, money would not compensate for. It had been asked, too, what was to be done when equivalent slaves could not be purchased? This case was not provided for, and though it was a prospective case, yet it had been pleaded as a difficulty. The learned member for Winchelsea had imputed to him (Mr. W. Horton) the expression, that a scale of compensation ought to be agreed upon before anything else was done; but he had never said so. What he had said was this&#x2014;let the House recommend as strongly as it pleased, but when it legislated on property, the difficulties of the question ought to be seriously considered, and the House ought not to pledge itself irrevocably to do an act of substantive injustice, for the sake of conforming to certain resolutions which it had passed. He had also been accused by the same learned gentleman, of being an opponent to the abolitionists. But when that learned gentleman told him, that he was an opponent to the abolitionists, he must beg leave to ask, who were meant by the term abolitionists? They were all pledged in one way&#x2014;all had agreed to the resolutions of 1823&#x2014;all were bound to carry them into execution; and he challenged any honourable member to say that he had ever done anything which did not tend to the accomplishment of these resolutions. As he had before observed, those resolutions contemplated the ultimate attainment of perfect freedom by the slaves: but they also intended, that private property should be respected; and they did therefore involve tremendous difficulties. Slavery had been represented to be an excrescence which was not wanted, and which would be removed the moment free labour came into operation. The event had proved that this representation was incorrect. He could assure the House that the common sergeant, Mr. Denman, and Mr. sergeant Bosanquet had been requested to find out, if possible, any persons who could
<image src="S2V0018P0I0523"/>
<col>1031</col>
shew that the Berbice appellants suffered less difficulty than they represented themselves to be labouring under. They were told that every assistance should be furnished them in their inquiries; but no person came forward. If any contrary evidence was to be obtained, he called upon hon. gentlemen to tell the House where it was to be found, and show that the difficulties which he had pointed out were ideal. He could not admit that this question ought to be disposed of by an arithmetical computation of what orders had been complied with, and what had not: though he saw no reason why those which one colony had complied with could not be complied with by another. If they did wish to conciliate the slave and the proprietor, the difficulties must be investigated. The interests of the master and the slave must be kept up, but not placed in collision; for if they were placed in collision, no pecuniary advantage would result to the master, and no benefit to the slave. The preservation of the two interests was a delicate matter. In this country, if property were put into the hands of trustees, to be applied to the use of children, but according to the interests of their father, no one could doubt that, in the performance of the trust, these parties would be very likely to be brought into collision. And thus it was with the interests of the slave and his master. But this he would venture to say, that the master who most consulted the benefit and happiness of his slave paid the greatest attention to his own interests. In considering this subject, it ought particularly to be recollected what the condition of the slaves was at the present time. It ought not to be forgotten, that there was a vast difference between the slave now, and the slave who, just imported from Africa, was bursting with indignation against his captors, and fretful and uneasy under fetters which he then were for the first time; sighing after the freedom he had lost, and grieving, among strangers, at the recollection of his friends and kindred from whom he had been torn. These were feelings, and this a situation of which the Creole slave was ignorant. He had been born in slavery, and never knew what freedom was. It ought to be recollected, that measures which might be adapted to the slave when first imported were not measures applicable to the present state of slavery in the West Indies. The right hon. gentleman concluded by declaring that it was not his
<col>1032</col>
object to vindicate the conduct of the colonial legislatures; but if the House was anxious to prevent ill consequences, it would show the colonies that, in proportion to its power to enforce, so was its inclination to reason guardedly, and to act with forbearance, upon a subject of much delicacy. One fact ought never to be lost sight of; namely, that the gratuitous benevolence of the House affected those hon. members who were believed to exhibit it neither in purse nor in person. Some lenity was due to those who felt it possible that their nearest interests, and those of all who were dependent upon them, might perhaps be hazarded, not by malevolence, but by the mere haste of acting without competent information. He should sit down with moving, "That a humble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that the minutes of evidence before the Privy Council, in the matter of the Demerara and Berbice manumission order, be laid before the House."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00763"><member>Mr. Keith Douglas</member><membercontribution> seconded the motion; but the hon. member was not audible in the gallery. We understood him to support the arguments of his right hon. friend, and to contend, while he approved of the resolutions of that House, that they ought to be enforced with equity and mildness. Great caution was necessary in their proceedings, particularly in the absence of the requisite information. This point had been much insisted on by the Colonial Legislature of Jamaica, and was the object of one of their resolutions in 1826. As to the Slave Trade, he was afraid the introduction of slaves into the foreign islands had not diminished, and that the restrictions we had imposed on that trade subjected the slaves, during the passage, to increased privations and hardships. He referred to several authorities to shew that parliament was greatly uninformed as to the true situation of the slaves in the West Indies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00764"><member>Lord Nugent</member><membercontribution> did not rise to oppose the motion, but for the purpose of making a protest against some of the doctrines laid down by the right hon. gentleman. The right hon. gentleman had deprecated going into any controversial matter; but he had stated some opinions, against which he found himself obliged to protest. He agreed with the right hon. gentleman in what he had said of the two resolutions of that House, with the exception of one word. There was a higher power than parliament,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0524"/>

and parliament could never guarantee a right against which nature had set her face. The law of nature and the law of God, said that man could not have a property in man; and therefore he must deny that the colonists had any claim to compensation for the manumission of their slaves, as a matter of right. He was ready to grant them that as a boon; he would deal liberally with them; but he must deny that they had any right to compensation. He could never admit, and he rose to protest against this doctrine, that any compensation could be legally claimed for a loss of property, which could not be acquired without a violation of all natural rights.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00765"><member>Mr. W. Whitmore</member><membercontribution> differed in one point from his right hon. friend. His right hon., friend had argued that, because there was no market-price for slaves, the appraisers could have no principle by which to determine their value. Now, he would contend, that there was a market price for slaves, they were still, and they would be, transferred&#x2014;this would give a market-price, and by this the appraiser might regulate his conduct. There would be some evil, however, in settling the price this way, for as the demand for them outgrew the supply, the price would rise. But still he would contend that there must, even on this principle, be a market-price for slaves. Those who owned land that yielded a profit of six or twelve per cent, would transfer their slaves to those who owned land that yielded eighteen per cent; and as long as a difference of this kind existed between estates, there must, and would be transfers of slaves, and a market-price. Certainly, they could not enforce compulsory manumission at a fixed price, but he was persuaded that our colonies would never be in a flourishing condition until all the slaves were converted into free labourers. This was what he looked to to give security to the planters themselves. In his opinion, the time was not far distant when the whole cultivation of the West Indies would be carried on by free labourers, and this was a state of things that would be, he was persuaded, infinitely more advantageous to the planters and the negroes than their present state. It must not be said that a vertical sun and a tropical climate would prevent this; for the House must know, that sugar was cultivated in Mexico by free labourers. Let the House look also to the East Indies: there sugar was culti-
<col>1034</col>
vated by free labour. However long this wholesome system might yet be delayed, he was persuaded that it was only upon this system that the West Indies could flourish, and sooner or later it would be forced on them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00766"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> said, he must protest, as he ever had done and should do, against the doctrine, that the ownership of slaves could be assimilated to the laws applicable to any other species of property. Man never could become the legal property of man. There was a maxim "<i>nullum tempus occurrit regi;</i>'' so it was with the imprescriptible rights of man. No prescription in slavery could render it just. He should like to know, whether any white man in this country would consent to give up his freedom, because ages back his ancestors were bondsmen. He would maintain that no right whatever existed to compensation; but he thought it possible, if any benefit had acccrued from the labour of those slaves, that other parties who had given the semblance of a right, or a temptation to continue in the acquisition of such property, ought to give a compensation for any damages that might be proved to have arisen; always provided that those who looked for that compensation had used that property as they ought, and that the loss they suffered did not arise from their own fault. That, however, was a right which could not affect negro property in itself, nor deprive negroes of that indefeasible claim to freedom which was the right of every man.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00767"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, he would not follow the line of argument pursued by some of his hon. friends as to the abstract right of property in the negro, or how far slavery was inconsistent with the laws of God; but he could not avoid remarking, that that mode of argument must naturally tend to excite distrust in the minds of the West-India proprietors towards those who had voted for the resolutions on a former occasion". When he heard such arguments as those of the noble lord, and of his hon. friend, the member for Norwich, as to compensation, he begged to ask them if they could get rid of the resolutions of parliament in 1823, which were founded on the rights of property? His hon. friend who spoke last had said, that no man had any right of property in another man. Now if he were a West-India proprietor, which he, was not, he should think, from the tenour of the resolutions of parliament
<image src="S2V0018P0I0525"/>
<col>1035</col>
in 1823, that he was entitled to some compensation; but he must own that he could expect but little from the tone of his hon. friend. Without going into the abstract question of slavery, he thought that under the different modifications of the relations between the rich and poor, in which the labours of the many were for the benefit of the few, his hon. friend would find among many classes of the people, much that required his commiseration, more than the condition of the negro slaves. There was, he thought (and he meant no imputation upon the benevolent motives of his hon. friend), but there was, he thought, a kind of quackery abroad on this question, and a feeling was excited, as if the slaves were in a most miserable and abominable condition. No authority, however high, was sufficient to remove this impression. If a report were presented from a governor of a colony, speaking of the comfortable condition of the slaves, it was at once said that he partook of the planters' turtle and punch, and that he was biassed in his opinion. If a military officer gave a statement on the same subject, interested motives were imputed; and while such authorities were disregarded, calumnies were daily spread abroad, and a state of things was described as related to the slaves, which he was sure only existed in the imaginations of those by whom such reports were circulated. He mentioned this, in reply to the general assertions which he had heard of the state of the slave-population in the West Indies. He, on the other hand, would assert, that the condition of that population, on well-regulated estates, was superior to that of many of the labouring classes in this country; but he would confine this assertion solely to the physical condition of the negroes. He was satisfied, that, as far as respected their moral improvement, the slaves of Antigua would, if examined as Christians by a set of catechists, be found to possess as much knowledge of the Christian doctrines as many classes of the population of the metropolis. He would take, for example, the large parish of St. Giles, and would back the Negro population of Antigua against the labouring classes in that parish, though with the advantage of being in a metropolis where people were in the habit of sitting in judgment on the morality of the rest of the world. He admitted with his right hon. friend, that there were difficulties in the settlement of
<col>1036</col>
this question. He agreed that parliament was bound to endeavour to ameliorate the condition of the slaves; but if those measures were carried to extremes, they would do much injury to the slaves themselves as well as to their masters. There was, it could not be denied, some reluctance on the part of some of the colonial legislatures to adopt all the measures recommended, but they were naturally distrustful of any recommendations from the government at home, when they found that most of those by whom such measures were urged upon the government here, openly avowed that their object was a total emancipation, and maintained the doctrine, that the colonists had no legal property in their slaves. They found hon. members saying one thing one day, and departing from it another. They might truly say, "We cannot trust you; we do not know the whole of what you would wish to do: and until we do, we will not adopt that which you now recommend, and which otherwise we might be disposed to accede to." It was said by some, that amelioration was recommended with a view to ultimate abolition, but his hon. friend (Mr. W. Smith) would go to abolition at once; he would not wait a moment. [Mr. W. Smith denied that he had said so.] His hon. friend might not have said so in direct terms, but that was the inference to be drawn from his line of argument. He differed from his hon. friends on the question of compulsory manumission. He thought that would be attended with difficulties which some of his hon. friends did not believe to exist. Under the Spanish law formerly, no difficulty existed on this score, because the place of the slave who purchased his manumission was soon supplied by the fresh importation which was at that time going-on from Africa; but no such importation now existed, and if the price rose with the increase of manumission, the system would soon cease to work; or if it were carried on even at the increased price, there must be an end of working the sugar plantations; for if the numbers on an estate were reduced very low, the labour of the remainder would be insufficient for its cultivation, and would therefore be of no value. This difficulty would not, he contended, be removed by means of labour. From all he had heard on this subject, he did not believe that in any one island of the West Indies free labour would be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0526"/>
<col>1037</col>
found sufficient for the cultivation of the estates. Where the land was rich, and the negro could procure with a little labour enough for the supply of his wants, no inducement which the colonists could hold out would be sufficient to make him work. He would talk about equal rights (of which they had heard so much from the hon. member for Norwich), and would Work for himself only. The House might learn from Mr. Coleridge's book the kind of value set upon freedom by the negro population of Trinidad, where the slave, in contempt for the freeman, called him a "Wilberforce nigger." He did trust that amelioration would be followed up as far as it was practicable, and that it would be carried on in that temperate tone from which only benefit could accrue to the slave as well as to the master. Now that the country had become rich and flourishing, people did not seem to attach much value to the colonies; but he feared the time would come when we should repent this line of conduct, and have to regret the neglect of those colonies which had served as so great a stimulus to our trade, and so great a mart for our manufactures.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00768"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, that amongst all the difficulties with which government had had to contend, in carrying into effect the measures with reference to the West-India colonies, none were more serious than those founded upon the doctrine of the abstract rights of man, advanced by the noble lord, and by his hon. friend the member for Norwich. This difficulty, great as it was, was very much aggravated by the opposite extremes indulged in by his hon. friend the member for Callington, who endeavoured to impress upon the House and the country, that slavery was in itself unavoidable, and that the condition of the slaves was preferable to that of the average of free labourers in this country. He was not surprised to hear such an unsound and extravagant principle advanced on one side, when he heard it advanced by a noble lord on the other side, that there could be no such thing as a legal right of property&#x2014;no such thing as an ownership in slaves. He did not know what this last assertion meant, for it appeared to him that the ownership in slaves was similar to other rights established by law. He acknowledged that it was an ownership entirely distinct from any other species of description of property; but let it not
<col>1038</col>
be supposed that he could ever entertain the opinion, that the right, whatever it was, could be violated without a compensation to the owner. He did hope that, when the House came to a discussion of this great question, which had arisen only incidentally upon a motion which nobody opposed, they would agree to avoid any discussion of abstract rights of property, and of abstract rights of man, and attend only to the legal rights of private ownership. Whilst the House did this, he should also wish them to bear equally in mind the resolutions of parliament, which directed the course of government to the gradual change from slavery to one which was to raise the negro to the same condition as the other subjects of the Crown. The present was an occasion oh which it would be altogether undesirable to enter into the merits of the case. When it was stated to him, that an opportunity of compulsory emancipation grew out of the situation of. the government of Trinidad, with respect to the Spanish laws, and that no difficulty arose of applying the principle to any other of the Spanish Islands, he dissented from the doctrine. By the old Spanish law, facilities were offered of supplying, by untutored savages from Africa, the places of what he might call the educated and apprenticed negroes, who were to be liberated. He fully agreed with what had been stated respecting the immensely improved state of the slaves in our old settled islands, subsequent to the abolition of the slave trade. The present negroes, in consequence of the abolition of the slave trade, were a race of beings very considerably raised in the scale of moral intelligence, and they were greatly improved in every thing that constituted moral worth and general utility. They had as much improved within the last twenty years as any people had improved in an equal space of time within the cognizance of history. Within these very few days he had had the opportunity of communicating with an individual who had just returned from Jamaica (he meant the Bishop of Jamaica), and he could assure the House, that the report which that right reverend individual had furnished, was very satisfactory as to the progress of moralization among the slave population since the abolition of the slave trade and, since the efforts made by his majesty's government to ameliorate the condition of the negroes. But it would be greatly to be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0527"/>
<col>1039</col>
lamented, for the sake of the slaves themselves, and of humanity in general, if the House were to interfere with the progress of the measures of government, so as to disturb the settled state of things; which, he maintained, was gradually leading to great improvements in civilization. The hon. member for Callington had said, that the negroes of Antigua were as well informed with respect to their religious duties as the labouring classes of St. Giles's, or of any of the central districts of the metropolis, or as the labouring classes of this country in general. If this were the case, he would ask his hon. friend whether these facts did not give him (Mr. Huskisson) a right to call upon the legislature of that colony to give these well-instructed, religious, and moral, persons, a full enjoyment of their civil rights &#x2014;the right to be heard in courts of justice, and to have their evidence received in the administration of justice. Was it no part of the rights of a civil member of the community that his evidence should be received in a court of justice? Let any hon. member reflect upon the many incidents in life in which this exclusion of evidence would affect the deepest feelings and interests of the slave population. The negro ought to be able to claim this right, when his property, or the welfare of his fellow-creature, was at stake. The first great act of melioration in the condition of the slave, was the interruption of the supply of negroes from the coast of Africa. It was admitted, that if a slave was emancipated by a compulsory process, another would be furnished to supply his place. An analogy had been drawn from labourers upon a small or upon a large farm; on these different farms there might be different degrees of profit; but the value of each labourer might be the same. The profits were greatest on the largest farm. One effect of what some were pressing in the House would be, that domestic slaves would be transferred to plantation labour. But the question of contingent compulsion was not to be considered at the present moment. In the Resolutions of 1823, two great points were to be considered. One was the amelioration of slavery&#x2014;the parties still continue in a state of slavery. This was what all parties would acquiesce in. But there was another part of the resolution &#x2014;the gradual transition from slavery to freedom. The House would not depart from this object. He did not
<col>1040</col>
mean to say that it would not be well to consider what other mode might be substituted, and what modifications of the present regulations might with propriety be introduced. These, however, were matters upon which it was the duty of ministers to wait until parliament took a different view of the question. They had taken one course, and had shown their inclination to adopt it. The next course must be, he would not fix any time, ultimately, securely, and with a view alike to the benefit of the negro, and the interest of the master&#x2014;to take such measures as will improve his civil and moral condition in a material degree. It was not his intention to detain the House further than by observing, that while ministers advised a revision of the course pursued elsewhere, they must keep their minds firmly fixed upon the principles with which they had set out, and the views arising out of those principles.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00769"><member>Mr. Fowell Buxton</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;I had originally resolved to follow the advice given by the noble lord (Nugent) considering the importance of the subject, the interests that are involved in it, and the absence, upon our part, of the information which the right hon. gentleman possesses. I had resolved to abstain from troubling the House with a single observation. The hon. member for Callington renders it impossible for me to adhere to that resolution. It is incumbent upon someone of those who have advocated the cause of the slaves, to stand up in his place and notice and repel his accusations. Up to the moment when he rose, the debate had been conducted with all possible tranquillity of temper. But the hon. gentleman favours us with a lecture upon temperance, moderation, command of temper, and control of tongue, in a speech just the most immoderate, intemperate, violent, and exasperating, that ever I heard in my life. In order to accomplish his purpose of calming irascible feelings, and banishing from this debate all topics which might create animosity, he is pleased to charge us with exaggeration, misrepresentation, quackery, and nonsense.<lb/>
I must confess, however, that he has sneered at us in very good company&#x2014;the rights of man and the laws of God were equally visited by his sarcasm. Now I defy him to prove any one instance of misrepresentation. I challenge him to abstain from general condemnation, and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0528"/>
<col>1041</col>
to put his finger upon that particular in which we have deceived the country. I will do so with regard to him. I will mark out those particulars in which himself has been guilty of misrepresentation. When I first agitated the question of slavery, I adverted to the use of the cart-whip; the hon. gentleman was the man who denied that any such instrument was in use in the West Indies. He termed my statement a gross and unwarrantable calumny. He was followed by a noble lord; who admitted that the whip was exhibited as an emblem of authority and a badge of office, but that it was ignorance, or a worse motive, which could induce any man to assert, that it was employed for any other than those innocent purposes of display. He was followed by an hon. member, who told us that he had resided for twenty years in the West Indies, and that he had never so much as heard of the cart-whip &#x2014;that he believed it to be a pure fiction invented in this country. What answer could we give to these assertions, grounded as they appeared to be upon experience? We were obliged to yield in silence to such a mass of authority. His Majesty's Government proposed to the West-Indians to abolish the use of the cart-whip altogether. Then we were told by the West-Indians that the extinction of the cart-whip would be the extinction of slavery. "O&#x0021;" said they, "you must leave us the whip; we cannot do without it."<lb/>
Again, we stated that there were obstacles to manumission. It was denied, and stoutly; and the debate of this night, and the propositions of the right hon. gentleman show with what truth it was denied. It was asserted by us, that Sunday was the market day&#x2014;a most vile and groundless calumny. But; when we called upon the colonists to give to the negro that which was equally the right of man and the cause of God&#x2014;the free use of the sabbath, this was pronounced to be an infringement of property, and a call was made for compensation. The hon. gentleman has dwelt this night upon the felicity of the slaves, and I understood him to say, that they are in a condition to be envied by the British peasant&#x2014;that they are the happiest of men, and the best of Christians; well fed, well clothed, well instructed, with none of the cares, with all the enjoyments, which pertain to men. But I wish to ask him if the negro is so very good a Christian, why you reject his
<col>1042</col>
testimony in a court of justice, and how it is that you explain your refusal to do so by saying, that the negro does not understand the nature and obligation of an oath, and that he is so false, that you cannot believe a word he says? how happens it that your very good Christian is in this predicament so very degraded and so very false?<lb/>
Again, these happiest of the happy&#x2014;will the hon. gentleman solve one difficulty that occurs to me? The negroes are better fed and better clothed, they eat more and work less than any people upon earth-&#x2014;but how happens it that their numbers decrease &#x2014;decrease at a rate entirely unequalled in the history of man? The negro population of the West Indies are disappearing at a rate such as no population has ever disappeared, in any of the parts of the world? If the whole family of man were to decrease in numbers at the rate in which the slave population is now perishing in Demerara, the earth would be depopulated in fifty years.<lb/>
The hon. member has indignantly censured [my hon. friend (W. Smith) for introducing the phrases "rights of men and laws of God," and I do not wonder that he is somewhat provoked at those obnoxious expressions; for one cannot think of slavery without perceiving, that it is an usurpation of the one and a violation of the other. In my estimation, my hon. friend did right in adverting to them. The right hon. gentleman (Wilmot Horton) tells us, that it is impossible to redeem the pledge of parliament, and to adhere to compulsory manumission. We cannot reconcile the promise which we have given for the extinction of slavery with a promise which we have also given for a due consideration of the rights of the parties interested. We are reduced to the alternative, he tells us, of sacrificing the planter to the interest of the slave, or the slave to the interest of the planter. If we are in that predicament, and must decide for the one or the other, my judgment is unequivocally in favour of the slave. And it is a consideration of the rights of man and the laws of God which lead me to that, unequivocal decision. Three parties are before us&#x2014;the planter, the British public, and the slave: and let us see the respective merits of the parties. From what is the planter's claim derived? From a crime. It is painful to say, but it is the hon. member for Callington who has extracted
<image src="S2V0018P0I0529"/>
<col>1043</col>
from us the truth&#x2014;it is a crime. [Mr. Gordon here observed that it was no crime, the slave trade was tolerated by law.]<lb/>
The hon. member has told us that there was no criminality in the slave trade, because the law allowed it. What&#x0021; is that no crime in itself which our law denounces as a felony? was that perfectly innocent which we now punish as a piracy? Could any planter of that day have been so blinded by his interest, and so insensible to truth, as to think that to go to Africa, to seize the unoffending natives, and commit spoliation, and robbery, and murder &#x2014;to render a quarter of the earth a ravaged wilderness&#x2014;to crowd its captured population into the holds of slave ships, and expose them to horrors worse than death&#x2014;to consign the survivors to perpetual servitude&#x2014;could the planter, I say, of those days believe that all these were innocent and righteous acts? It was a crime, and they knew it to be so; and that crime is the origin of their right.<lb/>
The British government, the second party, stands in the shameful predicament of having permitted and encouraged that crime. The only party who comes before us without reproach is the negro, who has been the victim of crimes which have been perpetrated by the one, and instigated by the other. When I heard the right hon. gentleman ask, "Are we to sacrifice the negro to the planter, or the planter to the negro," I put the case to my own mind thus: A and B commit a joint robbery; A being the principle, and B the accessory. The accessory, visited by pangs of conscience, wishes to make all the reparation in his power; namely, restitution of the things stolen to their rightful owner. The principal says, "No&#x0021; not till you have settled with me. I only did what you recommended. I cannot afford to renounce my share of the spoil, until you have indemnified me from any loss I may sustain, I will give up the property with all my heart, when you have given me an equivalent, and guaranteed me from every possible damage."<lb/>
But the third party has still to be heard. The slave may ask, "what have I to do with any disputes between those who have conspired to rob me?" He argues, that there are two questions&#x2014;one, the restitution of the thing stolen to the person to whom it belongs; the other, the adjustment of the proportion of loss between the offending parties. The first is every thing
<col>1044</col>
to the negro&#x2014;the last nothing. He has no kind of concern or interest in the question between the principal and the accessory, in "the robbery between the West-Indian planter and the British government&#x2014;and why are disputes between parties who are both in the wrong, to delay, for a single hour, the enjoyment of that which unquestionably belongs to him?<lb/>
I am not for immediate emancipation &#x2014;not that I am deterred by any supposed rights on the part of the planter, not that I think that the planter has the smallest title of right on the person of the negro, but because I do believe, that the West-Indians too truly assert, that the negroes are not fit for emancipation. They are so sunk, and debased, and brutalized, by slavery, that they are not fit, perhaps, for the common enjoyment and rights of mankind. I pause, therefore, before I would grant them immediate emancipation But, the more I am convinced of their degradation, the more do I hate slavery, the cause of that degradation. I would give the negro all that I could give him with security. I would do every possible thing to mitigate and sweeten his lot; and to his children I would give unqualified emancipation.<lb/>
Having done this, I would settle with the planter. I am a friend to compensation, but it is compensation upon the broadest scale. Perhaps the West-Indians may think my notions inconveniently extensive upon the subject of compensation, I am for compensation to all who have suffered by us; and in proportion to the degree in which each has suffered. The slave owner, by the laws of the mother country, has been tempted to embark his property in an unlawful investment. He went to the West Indies at our instigation. This is his claim, but if the planter was led to the West Indies by Our law, the slave was dragged thither by the same law. You have permitted, not forced, the one to commit a crime. You have forced, not permitted, the other to become the victim of that crime. Do you ask compensation for him who has wielded the whip? Then I ask compensation for him who has smarted under its lash. Do you ask compensation for loss of property, contingent and future? Then I ask compensation for unnumbered wrongs, the very least of which, is the incapacity of possessing any property whatever. If compensation be demanded, we re-echo the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0530"/>
<col>1045</col>
demand. It is that which we most fervently desire, only let it be just compensation, dealt out for the many who have suffered, and not confined to the few who may suffer in one particular.<lb/>
Sir, these are the truths of the case. They have been extorted from me by the hon. member. I had no intention of saying a word, for reasons immaterial to the House. I had resolved to take no part in this or any other discussion during the session, but the hon. member has compelled me to speak the plain truth&#x2014;and the plain truth is, that be has no right whatever to the person of the negro, though he may have some claim upon the liberality of the British government; and if any man thinks, that it were better not to divulge and insist upon these truths, I tell him that for their proclamation this night, he has to thank the hon. member for Callington, that as often as I shall hear the hon. member make the charge which he has made this night, so often shall I meet him as I have done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00770"><member>Mr. Bernal</member><membercontribution> said, that in the part which he was about to take in the discussion, he should avoid anything like an irritated or angry feeling. He appealed to his hon. friend, the member for Weymouth, whether he had not upon all occasions discussed this question calmly and dispassionately; Indeed, he always felt sorry when he found anything like angry discussion introduced into so important a subject. But he was not sorry at finding that the opinions expressed by the hon. member for Weymouth had been elicited that evening. He had taken a fair and manly course, and had given to the House the tone and opinions of himself and his coadjutors in the work (the great work no doubt he and they thought it) in which they were engaged. His hon. friend had at length plainly told them, that he would look to the compensation of the negro before that of the white master [hear, hear &#x0021;]. An hon. member cheered, but he would tell him, that that was not the wisest course to take, in order to attain the object which his hon. friend had in view. The West-Indians might be a weak body; but if driven and forced together, it might be found that they could muster both strength, and courage to resist those opposed to them, and who attempted to destroy their just rights. The hon. member went on to deny the decrease in the negro population. He was taken by surprise by the assertion, and
<col>1046</col>
was not at that period prepared to contradict it by documents; but he assured his hon. friend, that in many parts of Jamaica, particularly the sea coast, there existed many of the original African stock, who still contaminated the blood of the Creole population, by infusing into them feelings and dispositions of which they had never divested themselves. The hon. member, after adverting to the negro Sunday-market for the produce of their fowls, gardens, and pig-styes, went on to observe, that the Sunday-market was the wish of the negroes, and that they grumbled when the market hours were restricted to eleven o'clock. But were there not many things such as fish of particular kinds allowed to be sold in this country on Sunday mornings for the convenience of the poor? The hon. member had objected to the non-admission of slave evidence. Now, the House of Assembly in Jamaica, had extended the testimony of slaves to capital cases by their late law, and there had actually been two persons of free condition convicted upon slave evidence since the passing of the law. But, in consequence of that law being disallowed by his majesty, those convictions had fallen to the ground. He thought his majesty had been ill-advised in refusing to pass that particular act, which was only a temporary experiment: it had nipped the bud of expectation. He thought the government should speak out. The West-Indian interest had a right to demand from government a plain statement of what they meant to do. That sort of property was now unsafe; especially since it had been declared that it was bottomed in crime.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00771"><member>Mr. Sykes</member><membercontribution> justified the course pursued by the hon. members for Norwich and Weymouth. He thought the principle of negro slavery so inequitable, it was so unfair, that any body of men should govern their fellow creatures by a system of laws which enacted the penalty of twenty stripes for one offence, of thirty for another, and so on, punishing human infirmities by a self-assumed right as a superior order of beings: he considered this system so abhorrent to humanity, and so essentially repugnant to justice, that he would not detain the House by commenting on it. He maintained, that the slave population was decreasing at the rate of 2&#x00BD; per cent. per annum. As to the Sunday-market, he thought the sacredness of that day ought not to be disregarded, and that another
<image src="S2V0018P0I0531"/>
<col>1047</col>
day in the week should be given to the slaves in lieu of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00772"><member>Mr. James Wilson</member><membercontribution> complained of the aspersions and insinuations thrown out against the West-India proprietors, whenever an opportunity for doing so occurred. He would say to his compassionate brethren over the way, who were for galloping away thousands of miles from their own country and seeking to bestow their benevolence every where but in those places where it was most wanted, "look at home; go to Ireland and Scotland; there you will find misery and wretchedness enough; there you can be at no loss to discover plenty of starvation. In these places you may find persons, perhaps, related to yourselves, in a state of the utmost destitution, actually starving. When you have done what you ought to do in this respect, when you have relieved the poor of your own country, go abroad as fast as you like; relieve Ireland first, and then I will go hand-in-hand with you in assisting the West Indies, which, however, stands in need of assistance much less than the places already mentioned." He was the owner of a small parish in the north of England, and he had an estate in the West Indies, containing nearly the same number of subjects; and he could say most conscientiously, that the condition of the black-coloured people was infinitely superior to that of the tenantry of his parish in England. If one of his tenants in that parish wanted a glass of wine, he must go without it. Now that was a state of things which he never recollected in the West Indies. The hon. gentleman had thrown out a great deal of abuse upon the West-India planters, but he could say that they had feelings of kindness equal to any of the modern philanthropists. He desired those hon. gentlemen to recollect, that the planters held their estates and their present rights under the authority of acts of that House. Their situation was no act of their own; they went out from this country and purchased or laboured for their property, and left it to the children under the sanction of that House. Widows and orphans were the holders of much of that property, and he called upon the House to pause before it interfered with their rights. He called for protection to them and to himself with as much confidence as he called upon them for protection to his parish in Yorkshire. He spoke as a plain country gentleman, who had seen many ups and downs in life;
<col>1048</col>
he had seen many frosty mornings. He had laboured as much as any man for what he possessed; and though he did happen to be one of the masters of that portion of his Majesty's subjects who had dark complexions&#x2014;although he was one of their unfortunate masters&#x2014;he had always been disposed to act by them conscientiously. He had lived among them since he was a boy, in every situation; and he would tell his saintly brethren on the other side of the House, that if he was among the negroes and held but his little finger up, it would be enough. Subordination was necessary. Nothing could be accomplished without obedience to authority. He liked instruction well enough, but it must be in a moderate and temperate way. By doing too much they would do nothing. Emancipation in his opinion, must grow up from the seedlings, like the oak from the acorn. If they went to work temperately, he would lend them a helping hand; and without the cordial assistance of the West-India planter, he could assure the philanthropists they could never hope to be successful in their objects.</membercontribution></p>

<title>WESTMINSTER SESSIONS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00774"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member> moved, "for leave to bring in a Bill to extend the times of Sitting in Sessions at Westminster." At present there were four sessions in the year in Westminster, and eight in Middlesex. By the terms of their commission the magistrates of Westminster were at liberty, like those of Middlesex, to sit as often as they found it convenient; but at present they could not hold any sessions at Westminster during term, or while the judges of the King's-bench sat in Westminster-hall. The object of his bill was, therefore, to enable the magistrates to hold sessions when they pleased, notwithstanding the sittings of the judges of the King's-bench. At present, they held but four sessions yearly; and the consequence was, that an offender was frequently detained in confinement for three months before he was brought to trial, and then, perhaps he was only sentenced to a confinement of one month; so that, in fact, the confinement of the man, who must be looked upon as not deserving such confinement until he had been convicted, was three times greater before trial than after he was found guilty of the offence. He apprehended, therefore, that it would be a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0532"/>
<col>1049</col>
matter of general convenience, as well as of justice, that the sessions of Westminster should be held as frequently as those of Middlesex; and he should, therefore, move, "for leave to bring in a Bill to enable Justices of the Peace for Westminster to hold their Sessions of the Peace during the Term, and the Sitting of the Court of King's-bench."&#x2014;Leave was given.</p>

<title>CATHOLIC ASSOCIATION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00775"><member>The Marquis of Londonderry</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to ask a noble lord a question, which was connected with those observations which he had ventured to make to their lordships on a former evening, relative to the Roman Catholic Association. Before he asked, however, an explanation upon that point, he could not help, when he observed, in the reported proceedings of that Association, that a letter had been read from a noble lord (Duncannon), a member of the other House of Parliament, making a few observations with respect to the conduct of that noble lord. If that Association was bad in itself, it became infinitely worse when it was made a channel of communication to the Roman Catholics of Ireland, and when those political spirits, whom he could call no better than demagogues, made use of the authority with which they were thus clothed. The letter was too long to trouble their lordships by reading the whole, but he had selected one paragraph from it. The letter stated, "for lord Lansdowne, Mr. Tierney, and lord Carlisle, I am prepared to assure you now, as I did on a former occasion, that they and their friends were most anxious the question should be brought on, and that it would have had, as it always has had, all the support that as individuals they could have given to it. For this opinion, I can have no objection, now or at any other time, to have my name used. On the formation of the late government, I thought it my duty, as an Irishman, to give such advice to my Catholic countrymen as I thought most to their interest to pursue. I thought the agitation of that question, at that time, proposed, as it was attempted to be done, by the bitterest opponents of the Catholics, would have embarrassed the formation of the government, and I recommended a postponement of
<col>1050</col>
that question; but you will do me the justice to recollect, that I stated distinctly then, that it was only for that moment; and, indeed, if I could have proposed any thing further, I must have been insane to suppose that the Catholic people of Ireland would ever consent to such a disgraceful proposition. I will, however, say no more on this subject, leaving it to you, if you think fit, to set it right, as I really think it due, both to lord Lansdowne and the Catholics, that it should be rightly understood. The present posture of affairs is a hopeless one, as I really think the government as at present constituted, almost worse than lord Liverpool's. Mr. Lamb, indeed, has the best intentions towards Ireland, and lord Anglesea goes with the same intentions; but what can be hoped for from any such government, after Mr. Peel's speech last year, in which he took to the Home Secretary the complete control of Ireland." Thus it appeared that those noble lords above-mentioned had authorized the stating to the Catholics of Ireland, that if they had been able, they would have brought forward the Catholic question; but when their intentions respecting that question had been asked at the time they formed part of the government, they stated they would not bring it forward at that time; and he would assert, that, if they made that declaration to the people of Ireland through this Association, such a proceeding was clothing it with an authority of a highly improper character. The reading of that letter was followed by a speech from Mr. O'Connell, so absurd as to be undeserving of notice. After him, however, a gentleman got up and said, that he was desired by lord Clifden to state that the marquis of Anglesea regretted exceedingly the unfortunate expressions which he had used on a former occasion, with respect to the Catholics of Ireland. Now, he doubted not, that if the noble marquis intended again to make a recantation of his opinions on that question, their lordships would have known it by his proxy, or by some other mode. He could not believe that the noble marquis had authorized the noble lord opposite to make a declaration of his sentiments to the Association, neither could he imagine that that noble lord had made such a statement without the consent of the noble marquis, yet here it stood reported. He thought, therefore, it would be of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0533"/>
<col>1051</col>
essential importance, if, by these observations, he should give the noble lord an opportunity to unmask the imposture by which mischievous political spirits attempted to govern Ireland. It was solely for that purpose that he had ventured to address the few observations he had made to their lordships, and he did hope that government would take such measures as would put down, for the sake of the happiness of the country, that most mischievous Association. He hoped the noble lords, to whom he had alluded, would do him the justice to believe that his only object was to enable them to state distinctly what was the meaning of the declarations made at the meeting of that Association.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00776"><member>Lord Clifden</member><membercontribution> hoped, after the speech of the noble marquis, he might be allowed to say a few words. If the noble marquis had not put a question to him he should, nevertheless, have stated, that he never had authorized the gentleman who had been mentioned by the noble marquis, to make the declaration which he had just heard read. He understood that the proceedings of the meeting had been ill-reported. With respect to the Association, their lordships would recollect, that it was now thirty-five years since, under the shapes of convention, committee, or association, the Catholics had carried on their applications for relief from those laws which the wisest and ablest men in the country contended ought to be abrogated. In 1793, an act passed to put down the convention; and that act was so worded, that had it not been for a special exception in favour of the two Houses of the Irish parliament, they could not have continued to sit. In consequence of that act of parliament, the convention appeared in the shape of a committee, and during the government of the duke of Richmond there was a violent contest with that committee, and he forgot what was the end of it. Then arose the Association, and this state of things would continue until the two countries were identified. There was no choice for their lordships for putting down the Association, but by the strong arm of power, and even then it would rise up in some other shape, like the Carbonari in Italy. Their lordships could not muzzle, crush or strangle six million of people. He was, however, far from justifying the acts of the Association. In many cases he exceedingly lamented them. For the
<col>1052</col>
marquis of Anglesea and for Mr. Lamb he had the greatest respect. There never had gone out to Ireland a governor nor a Secretary more popular, both among Catholics and Protestants. The noble marquis was admitted by all parties, equally disposed to put down the Orange violences in the north, and the Catholic violences in the south, and to deal strict justice between both parties. The great thing was to convince the people of Ireland that perfect justice was to be done them. He greatly lamented that a time had been allowed to pass when it would have been possible to put down the Association. It was, however, stated, that if the claims of the Catholics of Ireland were granted at all, they would still be unquiet. But if that should be the case, they would then find opposed to them both the Catholics and Protestants of England sixteen millions against five or six millions. If forty thousand armed men were sent over to Ireland to prevent the meetings of the society, they might drive the Catholics under ground,&#x2014;but still the mischief would exist until the Catholic question was set at rest. The settlement of that question was the <i>sine qua non</i> for bringing peace to Ireland. As he had said before, he expected much good to Ireland from the present governor-general, and his secretary. It was also said, that the patronage was to be distributed in a reasonable and just degree. As to the letter which the noble marquis opposite had read, he must confess that he saw nothing in it; although he could not defend the writing to the gentlemen of the Association. He was himself a sufferer through them; though he dealt more tenderly with them than the noble marquis. In Ireland there was a great deal of talent, but he was sorry to say very little discretion; and this Association was often deficient in the latter respect. The publishing of that letter was a very unjustifiable act. The noble marquis opposite had made some remark on the Catholic question not being brought forward last session, by his noble friends near him. The noble marquis should recollect, that the question had been once decided last year, and that its friends had been called to office so shortly after that decision, that they could not have been expected to bring it forward. Had they been a year in office, they would have done so. He gave all due credit to the present government, and especially to the noble marquis who had gone to Ireland,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0534"/>
<col>1053</col>
for a desire to conciliate that country; and, if measures were pursued to prevent all Orange or Catholic excesses, that would be the likeliest method to produce peace there, or at least an abatement of the present feelings of hostility. Their lordships were aware of the monstrous religious hatreds which existed in that country. In Ireland there were Christians acting against every principle of Christianity&#x2014;the high-church people and Orange party on one side, and the Catholics on the other. He did believe, that there were members of the high Orange party and the Catholics, who were ready to cut each other's throats. He hoped, however, that they were not many who were so disposed. The best method to remove these feelings was by a firm and equal government; and he again said, that to put down the Association, there was only one way, and that was, by concession, under certain regulations&#x2014;whether by a treaty with the Pope or a provision for the clergy. He knew that that was scouted by the Association, but he cared very little for what they might scout.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00777"><member>The Marquis of Lansdowne</member><membercontribution> said, he should not have thought it necessary to take a part in the conversation, which had arisen in consequence of the observations of the noble marquis opposite, had not the noble marquis introduced his name in reading a copy of a letter which he had then heard for the first time. After hearing that letter read, and after the observations made by the noble marquis, it became necessary for him to state, that he never authorized any communication to be made, directly or indirectly, to the Catholic Association. He would go further and say, that he never had, and never would. He thought it due to his noble friend whose name appeared at the end of that letter, to say, that he had repeatedly stated to his noble and honourable friends that he thought himself called upon, in consequence of it having been proclaimed in Ireland," that he had endeavoured to induce the Catholics not to petition parliament in the present session, to declare that he had not, either directly or indirectly, made such endeavours or given such advice. He never had thought himself called upon to communicate with the Catholics, through their Association, or any other medium, as to the time at which he might think proper to bring forward their claims for the consideration of parliament.
<col>1054</col>
He had uniformly stated to them, that he considered them at liberty, as a portion of the king's subjects, to bring forward their claims, in the form of a petition at that time which they might think most expedient; and he had as uniformly stated, that whatever might be the course adopted by the individual to whom that petition was intrusted, still he (lord Lansdowne) would exercise his own discretion, as to the time at which he should think fit to found on that petition any motion for their lordships' consideration. Upon this subject he had invariably used his own judgment, and to this principle he would at all times, and under all circumstances, adhere. He might have a petition from that body to present, and if called upon to say when he would bring the great motion forward, his answer would be, that he would give due notice of such an event. When he did so it would be, not because he was required by the Catholic Association, or even by the Catholics of Ireland, but because of his impression as to its effect, not only upon the Catholics, but upon the empire at large. That Association, although composed of great talent, was certainly wanting in discretion, and certainly deficient as to the mode by which they should bring that great talent to bear upon their interest. He had made no inquiries of them, because he did not think them qualified to act. Neither did he think that this great question ought to be dealt, with according to the views or opinions of any body of men, but according to the interests of the public at large. He was far from wishing that the Catholic Association had power: he wished, indeed, that they had not the power of irritating, as they had irritated, by language far from being dignified or wise. He would, however, treat language used under such circumstances with total disregard, rather than give it importance by making it the subject of discussion in that House. A time would soon come when all the talent of that house would be called forth upon that question, in which all interests were concerned; and he hoped that the utmost attention would be given to the subject, because he felt it now, more than ever, their bounden duty to devise some measure for securing the tranquillity and promoting the interest of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00778"><member>The Earl of Roden</member><membercontribution> expressed his earnest hope that some measure would immediately be adopted for suppressing
<image src="S2V0018P0I0535"/>
<col>1055</col>
that abominable nuisance, the Catholic Association. It was said it could not be put down, but he should like to see the experiment tried. Whatever difference of opinion noble lords might entertain on the question of Catholic Emancipation, there could be only one as to the evil effects produced by the inflammatory speeches of the demagogues now meeting in Dublin. The suppression of the Association was not only of importance to the safety of the loyal Protestants of Ireland, but to the peace and happiness of the Catholic peasantry. All those who, like himself, were induced to reside on their estates in Ireland, and who endeavoured to improve the condition of those dependent on them, could bear testimony to this fact.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SUSPENSION OF A JUDGE IN INDIA.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00779"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, that seeing an hon. member connected with the Board of Control in his place, he wished to call his attention to the reported removal or suspension of a judge in India. The alleged offence of the learned person said to have been thus disposed of was, that in the course of delivering a legal opinion, he had mentioned something, as if he contemplated the probability of the time arriving when the East India Company's charter might not be renewed. Now, he thought there could be no doubt that any man was justified in stating, without meaning to question the supremacy of the East India Company, that by law their charter expired at a certain time. Indeed, if any man should take upon himself to state that the charter would be renewed as a matter of course, that would be illegal; it would be doing what the Crown and the Parliament could not do. Mr. Justice Blackstone had laid it down to be one of the few things which the Crown or Legislature could not do, to bind themselves down as to what they would do at a future time; yet here was a judge, because he had chosen in argument, to contemplate the possibility of that which he (Mr. Brougham) earnestly wished might prove the fact; namely, that the Company's charter would not be renewed, at least not without great curtailment of their monopoly, and a corresponding extension of the rights of the subject, instantly suspended from his judicial functions, If the statement, the
<col>1056</col>
substance of which he had given to the House, and which had appeared in the public prints was true, it was impossible, he thought, that the House should not take up the matter. He hoped, however, that his mind would be relieved from the impression made by the statement, by hearing that it had no foundation in truth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00780"><member>Mr. Courtenay</member><membercontribution> said, it was impossible for him to declare that the statement in question had no foundation whatever. He could only say, that no intelligence of the suspension of Mr. Courtenay Smith had reached the Board of Control. He would, however candidly state, that information had been received of an explanation having been called for from Mr. Smith of the expression alluded to. Further than that, he knew nothing on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00781"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> wished to know by whom that explanation had been called for? In this country a judge could not be called to give an explanation of what he had said, except to the Court of Appeal. It was perfectly well known that any person connected with Government in this country who shall presume to call upon a judge for an explanation of what he had said, might be impeached and removed from office, besides suffering other penalties.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PUBLIC CHARITIES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00783"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> observed, that on a former evening an hon. member had put a question to him with the view of eliciting some information respecting the labours of the commission appointed to inquire into the abuses of charities, and at the same time the hon. member expressed an opinion, that the reports made by the commissioners were inoperative, and, as it were, a dead letter. At the time the question was proposed, he had stated his impression, that in every instance in which the commissioners thought it desirable that the attention of the Court of Chancery should be called to any charge of abuse, the Attorney-General had directions to attend immediately to their wishes. Upon inquiry he had found that such in fact was the arrangement. In order to prevent unnecessary correspondence, it had been arranged between the Secretary of State and the commissioners, that the latter should have the power of making direct application to the Attorney-General; who in his turn was authorized
<image src="S2V0018P0I0536"/>
<col>1057</col>
to institute proceedings immediately. In 1824, he had moved for a return of the number of counties to which the commissioners had extended their labours, and the number of causes which had been instituted by the Attorney-general in connexion therewith. He thought the best course he could pursue was, to move for a return of a similar nature respecting the period which had intervened from 1824 to the present time. An hon. member had on a former evening objected to the expensive nature of the Reports which had proceeded from the commission; but he should have recollected that the commissioners were obliged to go into great detail; it being the object for which they were appointed to produce a permanent record of the funds of each charity, in order that it might be seen that they were fairly applied. He was of opinion that extensive benefit had resulted from the labours of the commissioners and the Attorney-general. The right hon. gentleman concluded with moving for a return of the nature he had stated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00784"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> seconded the motion. There certainly was, he said, in many commissions, a great tendency to slumber in their proceedings; although appointed for temporary purposes, they enjoyed a good revenue, and did little work, just enough to serve as a pretence for continuing their appointment. That observation, however, did not apply to the commission in question. He concurred in what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman respecting the reports of the commission. What parliament wanted was a registration of the rights of the poor, a distinct declaration of the objects of the various charities in the kingdom, in order that every person who had a right under the endowments, might at once be able to claim it. The cheapest mode of registration was by means of the press. Many hundreds of copies of the commissioners' reports had been spread over the country; and in various places, portions of those reports had been reprinted, to make all mankind acquainted with the contents. He considered the reprinting of parts of the reports a very judicious proceeding, and was desirous that some plan should be devised for doing it more frequently. Of this he was satisfied, that the labours of the commission had caused the correction of many abuses which had arisen in charities; frequently, he would admit, from ignorance, but very often
<col>1058</col>
from unworthy causes. When, in travelling over different parts of the country, he saw houses rising connected with charitable estates, which bore the date, not of 1720, but the more recent one of 1821, he could not avoid guessing that their erection was not unnaturally connected with the inquiries of the commissioners. He bore no responsibility on his shoulders with respect to the appointment of commissioners. Some of the appointments were, he thought, very injudicious, but altogether, in the performance of their duties, they had fully answered his expectations: nay, they had exceeded them. He trusted he should have no more objections to the voluminous reports of the commissioners, because he considered it absolutely necessary that they should include statements of great detail. Those reports contained much curious and interesting information for the historian and antiquary. This species of information was frequently selected for the use of the public at large, and published in a detached form.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CATHOLIC CLAIMS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00786"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, he held in his hands a petition which he trusted would receive the serious attention it deserved from the House, as well from the importance of the body from which it came, as the matter it contained. It was a petition from the general body of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, and had attached to it the names of the leading advocates, as well Peers as Commoners, of that body. They prayed the House to erase from the Statute-book a law, which was alike discreditable to Catholics and Protestants, as it made it imperative upon the former to state, and the latter to sanction the statement, that the Roman Catholic religion was damnable and idolatrous; thus denouncing a great, portion of the empire. The petitioners further stated that such a declaration was unchristian and illiberal, pointing out as outcasts a great portion of the people of Ireland. They prayed the repeal of all tests, oaths, and obligations, which operated in producing the disabilities under which they at present laboured with respect to seats in the Councils of the empire. It was unnecessary for him to add, that he entirely concurred in the prayer of the petition. He hoped the very respectable body who had intrusted their petition to his care would not consider him guilty of the slightest want of zeal in

<title>LICENSING SYSTEM.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00788"><member>Mr. Brougham</member><membercontribution> said, he held in his hand a petition from a person named John Yule, late the keeper of a respectable inn in Halifax. The petitioner complained of the conduct of certain magistrates. He gave the names of those magistrates, but be (Mr. B.) would forbear mentioning them; if, however, the case which the petitioner stated was true, then he thought it the hardest that had ever come within his knowledge, and at the same time strongly illustrative of the caprice with which licences were granted or withheld. The petitioner stated that, in May, last year, he took a lease of a respectable inn, in Halifax, at a yearly rent of 85<i>l</i>, and that he made a deposit of a considerable sum of money in advance; that last Easter he appeared before five licensing magistrates, three of whom were opposed to a renewal of his licence. When called in he was told that his licence was lost: he aked why? and the answer he received was, that the magistrates never gave reasons. He challenged inquiry; he called for the testimony of any person who could shew any irregularity on his part; he stated that his house had never been open after ten o'clock at night, save on a fair, or a market day; that on Sundays his house was never open during church-time, and frequently it was kept closed during the whole of Sunday. But all would not do; the magistrates said they had made up their minds, and would give no reasons on the subject. One magistrate who was standing by felt indignant at such conduct, and said that the proceeding was illegal, and then used a stronger term to the same effect. The magistrates, however, carried it their own way, and in the end the petitioner was left a ruined man; his capital was expended in the repairs of the house, the expense of the lease, and other necessary outlays; that lease was still on his hands at an enormous rent&#x2014;the house being no longer that of a licensed victualler. The petitioner was a married roan, with a family; he had
<col>1060</col>
two aged parents to support; in addition, his sister, who had assisted him in his business, was a widow, and with her six children, entirely dependent upon him. The petitioner laid his case before two respectable barristers, friends of his, who go the Northern circuit. His two learned friends, without assigning their reasons, told the petitioner, that he had no legal remedy, and therefore it was that he had applied to that House.&#x2014;[Mr. M. A. Taylor was here observed speaking to Mr. Peel, and Mr. Brougham paused for a moment]. He then said, he was willing to wait until his hon. friend, the member for Durham, had got his answer, and he would then go on. He was extremely sorry to interrupt private conversations, but he must proceed. The petitioner threw himself on the mercy of the House, and prayed an investigation into his case. If the statements in the petition were true, it was the hardest case he had ever met with.</membercontribution></p>

It was not for himself that he felt, but for the House, which he was detaining. He knew not how much longer his hon. friend's conversation might have lasted if he had not, by his expostulation, called down the vials of his wrath.

nathan Fox, now a prisoner in Newgate, be brought to the bar of the House, in order to his being discharged."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00795"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> thought the House was bound to protect its rights and privileges. Those privileges, like all their other rights, they were bound to exercise for the public good. He believed that, if this individual had not been committed, not a word of truth would have been got out of the other witnesses. It was idle to talk of their ignorance. Those low Yorkshiremen were possessed of as much cunning as any hon. member in that House-But, if they were to bring' this man up to be discharged, surely they would take care that it should not be without a reprimand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00796"><member>Mr. Stewart</member><membercontribution> supported the motion for the discharge of Fox.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00797"><member>Sir C. Burrell</member><membercontribution> also thought the motion ought to be agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00798"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, that, if ever there had been a case for the interference of the House, it was that of the individual in question, whose conduct had been such as; to render it absolutely necessary to commit him. In his opinion, there would be no harm in allowing Fox to remain in Newgate until the termination of the inquiry relative to East Retford. However, if the I House thought differently, he was content that the individual should be called to the bar, and discharged, after receiving a proper reprimand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00799"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> thought the resolution of the House the other night was quite necessary, because the object of the witness seemed to have been the wilful concealment of the truth; and when the House had once shewn a determination to punish an individual who had so offended, they could not so trifle with their proceedings as to extend almost as a matter of course their lenity to him, merely because he came the next day and petitioned for their indulgence. He therefore wished this motion had been postponed; but as it had been made, and the petition was a proper one, he would give his consent to its prayer, amending it only by adding the condition, that the individual be brought up on Monday instead of that night, and that he should then receive a reprimand from the Speaker. He trusted that, if the worthy alderman had any prejudices against Yorkshiremen, he would not display them on the present occasion. The witnesses who were to be examined that night came from the town of East Retford,
<col>1062</col>
and with all deference to the topographical knowledge of the worthy alderman, he begged to inform him that East Retford was not in Yorkshire but in Nottinghamshire [a laugh.]</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00800"><member>Mr. N. Calvert</member><membercontribution> did not object to the motion as amended, but should like to put the same witness again under examination, to see what effect his punishment had had on him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00801"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> thought the punishment too slight, considering the grave nature of the offence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00802"><member>Mr. Crompton</member><membercontribution> stated, as an apology for the witness, that he was in ill health when he was called to the bar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00803"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> objected to the re-examination of Fox, lest it might be said that his evidence had been obtained by the application of a sort of torture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00804">The Motion as amended was agreed to. After which, the House went into a committee on the bill, Mr. R. Gordon in the chair.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00805"><member>Mr. E. C. Brown</member><membercontribution> was called in, and Mr. Tennyson proceeded to interrogate him. In your examination of the 4th of March, you stated that you knew in some of these elections, there were above forty electors at East Retford who would not take money. I will now put into your hands the lists of the burgesses for 1818, 1820, and 1826. Will you mark off, in any of those lists, the forty names you have alluded to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00806">The witness retired with the lists, when</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00807"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> suggested, that as the witness had in his former examination, merely given his opinion, they had better not dwell on an answer so given, but go into the evidence of the particular fact sought to be established.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00808"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> said, he wanted to shew how far the fact would, or would not, justify the witness's opinion of there being forty who would not take bribes. If the names were marked, then the opinion could at once be brought to the test.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00809"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> said, that the witness was not called upon to give an opinion against the guilty, but in favour of the innocent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00810"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, that still they must have positive instead of secondary evidence; of what use, then, was the delivery of a mere opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00811"><member>Sir J. Wrottesley</member><membercontribution> said, that even with the supposition that forty refused to take bribes, it did not follow, from a mere
<image src="S2V0018P0I0539"/>
<col>1063</col>
opinion, that all the other electors were guilty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00812"><member>Mr. Stewart</member><membercontribution> said, that if it were competent for one witness to mark off forty names as innocent, it would be equally competent for another to mark off as many more who were in his opinion guilty&#x2014;a course both irregular and inconvenient.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00813"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> argued, that as it stood on the minutes that forty voters would not receive bribes, it was fit to ascertain who those forty were, and whether they deserved the character for purity which had been given them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00814"><member>Mr. Batley</member><membercontribution> reminded the committee, that the witness had said, that sir H. Wilson was determined not to give a single penny, but to stand on his hostility to the Catholic claims.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00815"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> was in favour of pursuing the inquiry. The witness's declaration in favour of the forty burgesses was only matter of opinion, the value of which might be judged of by the various means in the power of the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00816"><member>Sir E. Knatchbull</member><membercontribution> remarked, that the committee could not act upon the mere opinion of the witness after it had been given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00817"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> contended, that the opinion of the witness could not influence the vote of a single member, nor add at all to the weight of the testimony the hon. gentleman was scraping together to disfranchise the borough of East Retford. The assertion of the witness was, that there were forty burgesses who would not take bribes, and he was told to go out and mark them in the list, without being able to say from his; own knowledge whether such and such a man had taken a bribe. To take such evidence was only to incumber the minutes, and indulge curiosity without furthering the ends of justice.<lb/>
The witness was recalled. He stated, that he had marked seventy names in the list of 1826, of persons who would not have received a bribe. He spoke from his own knowledge, because, when he told sir H. Wilson's voters that he would give them no money, they replied, that they would support him notwithstanding, on the ground of the Catholic claims. He had not said in terms, that sir H. Wilson would give them no money, but that he would do what was right and just, and no more. By the words "right and just," he meant that no money would be given to them.
<col>1064</col>
The number of voters who would not take bribes had been increased by him from forty to seventy, as nearly all who had been sworn in since 1820, were in favour of sir H. Wilson. When he told sir H. Wilson's voters that he would only do what was right and just, they knew that he meant that they would obtain no money. He had not used more direct terms, because he had been told not. They replied, that they would support him nevertheless, and hence he concluded, that they would not have taken bribes. If a candidate told the electors that he would do what was just and right, witness did not believe they would understand that those words meant that he would make the customary payment of election money. Witness had told the electors so, on the part of sir H. Wilson; but he believed the electors understood him to mean that sir H. Wilson would vote against Catholic emancipation. Many of them had promised to give their votes to sir H. Wilson if he would pledge himself to vote against the Catholic question. Twenty-three of the electors who voted for sir H. Wilson at that election, received no election money. None of them had complained of not being paid what they were promised. What witness said to the electors was, that sir H. Wilson would do what was just and right, and no more. There are 219 voters for East Retford, of whom seventy, witness believed, had not taken the election money. He did not know whether the practice of paying this money was usual. He did not believe that if the Catholic question had not produced so much excitement among the electors, so many of them would have declined to take the money. Sir H. Wilson was the popular candidate with the resident electors. There were 104 residing in the town. Sir H. Wilson polled twenty-nine votes. There were forty-two electors to poll when the election closed, of whom twenty-nine were for him. The general answer witness had when the votes were refused was, that they were already promised. Fifty-one electors had been admitted since 1820. The witness was asked, why he had omitted in the former part of his evidence to add the words "and no more," in the statement of what he had said to the electors on behalf of sir H. Wilson? His reply was, that he had always made use of the additional words. The short-hand writer read the evidence, which was contrary to the witness's state-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0540"/>
<col>1065</col>
ment. The explanation he gave was, that he had seen the words in the public papers, and thought he had used them. Being pressed to answer the question, whether, if a candidate or his agent was to say he would do what was just and right, the electors would not understand him to mean that he would give the election money? witness said, he believed the majority of the voters would understand that the candidate meant the election money. If sir H. Wilson had entertained the suggestion of giving the election money, what proportion of the electors would you have told him would have received it? I should have said three-fourths. From the conversations witness had with sir H. Wilson, he believed that that gentleman never did intend to give a single shilling.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00818"><member>Mr. Richard Hannam</member><membercontribution> was re-called to prove, that Leadbeater was one of those he had seen paid in 1812, at the Angel-inn. Witness was cross-examined by Mr. Denman, to ascertain whether he had not been accused of keeping some money intrusted to him? He answered very positively in the negative. At the Angel-inn Pickup had the money and paid it. Witness never touched a farthing of it: one man who had not attended there, was under the mistake that witness had his money, but such was not the fact: no money was intrusted to him to be distributed; it was not true that the electors had objected to his being employed as an election agent, because they alleged he had withheld any money from them. He had only paid one man himself, and that had been within a few days afterwards. He believed that the payments for the election of 1812, were all completed in 1814. It was well known that he was the agent of Mr. Osbaldeston in 1812, and he had pointed out to Mr. Pickup who were likely to be the friends of Mr. Osbaldeston. There was not a farthing deposited with the witness for the purpose of making payments. He had been clerk to the magistrates of the district for twelve or fourteen years. Mr. Clark was the partner of Mr. Vaughan, and the former had been connected with a celebrated will-cause that had been tried some years ago. Buxton was not paid because he was so intolerably drunk, otherwise he could have had his money, if he had come down for it. The witness had signed a paper that had been brought to his office for the purpose of obtaining the removal or extension
<col>1066</col>
of the enfranchisement of the borough; Ire had signed it because he thought it right; and he did not believe that there was a man in the town who did not think so. He had not discovered any of the secrets of his employer, nor would he do so. He had never given information about Mr. Osbaldeston's election till he had been summoned by the House, and he certainly would not have come if he could have helped it. Mr. Gregson had come down on the subject, and had written him a note: until he received it he knew nothing of him. In consequence of that note he went over to him at Barney Moor, and told him who had been paid. This took place before the matter had been brought before the House, for the first time, in the shape of a petition. All that he had disclosed to Mr. Gregson was, that the freemen had been paid as usual. He had not been offered any advantages for those disclosures, nor did he know for what he had been sent down. Ever since the election of 1812, it had been notorious that many of the freemen were corrupt: and he did not believe that any of the candidates had refrained from giving them money, with the exception of one, and he did not expect that he would ever stand again.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00819"><member>By Mr. Crompton.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Have you ever received any penalties that have been levied under the game laws? I have.&#x2014;Did you put those penalties into your own pocket? No; I have paid them over to the clergyman of the parish, and to the proper authorities.&#x2014;The borough of East Retford was situated in the hundred of Bassetlaw. If the right of election was extended over the whole hundred, there would be seventy-four townships, or parishes included in it. There were many noblemen and gentlemen in the hundred who would have influence, owing to their estates. If the number of voters should be 1,200, there would be a great number of them under the political influence of the Duke of Newcastle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00820"><member>By Mr. Davenport</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;If you were told a person had said to the freemen that he would do what was right and just, what should you understand by it? That he would pay them the forty guineas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00821">The witness was ordered to withdraw.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00822"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> said, it now became his duty to introduce a question of considerable delicacy, on which he wished to have the advice and assistance of the com-

<col>1067</col>
mittee. It had been stated in evidence by I Jonathan Fox, that in 1818 or 1819, he had received the sum of 2,800<i>l</i>. from a gentleman who was at that time a candidate for East Retford, and had at present a seat in the House. That money was to be distributed amongst the voters; and it appeared that Fox entered an account of its expenditure in a book; which official voucher he had subsequently given up to the gentleman by whom the money had been advanced. Now, it would not only be important, as forming part of a regular chain of evidence, to call that gentleman, and to examine him, for the purpose of ascertaining whether that voucher was still in existence; but it was still more important to take that step, for the purpose of removing any unfavourable impression with respect to their proceedings, that might be entertained by the public, who were anxiously watching these proceedings. Because, when it was seen that they had examined, with a great deal of just severity, persons in a subordinate station of life, whose poverty had tempted them to offend against the law, it became a matter of manifest importance, that an individual of rank, even though he were a member of that House, should not be passed over in silence. They were bound, in the discharge of their duty, to place that gentleman at the bar, in order that they might have the benefit of his examination. It ought, at least, to be made known to the world, that if persons whose poverty exposed them to temptation were brought before the House, they would not overlook individuals who were equally, if not more criminal, since they supplied the means by which honest indigence was tempted. Under ordinary circumstances, he might feel a good deal of delicacy in advising such a course; but any feeling of delicacy which he might entertain on the subject, was entirely obliterated, by the part which the hon. gentleman to whom he alluded had taken on this occasion. The evidence given before the committee, and the matter contained in the report, proved what is the conduct of the hon. member had been in these election transactions. As this was the case, it was to have been expected that the hon. member would have sought in silence, some consolation for the course he had pursued. When, therefore, he coupled this circumstance with the expectation which the community had a right
<col>1068</col>
to entertain, that they would administer even-handed justice between the poor and the rich, or if any difference were made, that it should consist in more severely scrutinizing the conduct of persons moving in a higher sphere than they would the actions of individuals who were not possessed of rank or fortune, he deemed it a duty incumbent upon him to move that the hon. gentleman to whom he alluded, should be examined at the bar. This was nothing more than an act of justice towards that hon. gentleman, who would thus have an opportunity of clearing himself from the imputations which had been cast upon him by the witness Fox. The hon. gentleman then moved, "that Samuel Crompton, Esq., formerly member for East Retford, and now a member of this House, be called to the bar of this House, to give evidence touching the East Retford election."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00823"><member>The Chairman</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;The question for the committee to consider is, whether, if the hon. gentleman be called to the bar, he will feel disposed to answer any questions that may be put to him, and if not, what power the committee possesses to enforce answers? The case of calling a member of the House to the bar is not, I believe, a very common one: but instances have occurred where members who were called upon to be examined before the House of peers have refused to answer certain questions. My impression is, that the hon. gentleman may also refuse to answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00824"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, it was in the power of the committee to demand answers to such questions as might be put to a member.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00825"><member>Mr. Crompton</member><membercontribution> said, he did not mean to say any thing at all on this question. He did not think it was necessary. He felt ashamed of nothing that he had done. As to what the hon. member for Colchester had said about his conduct, he would make no observation on it. He had been elected for this borough in 1812 and 1818; and, if that House determined to call on him for information, he hoped it would be found that he never had swerved from the right line of duty. But this he would say, that he never would come forward at the mere wish of the hon. member for Colchester, to enter into any explanation. It must be a better man than the hon. member for Colchester who would bring him to disclose his private affairs. [Cries of order.] He would not be examined by that hon. member.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0542"/>
<col>1069</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00826"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> rose to order. The hon. member for Derby had chosen to state, that while he was willing to be examined by other persons, he would not allow himself to be examined by the hon. member for Colchester.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00827"><member>Mr. Crompton</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;" I won't&#x2014;I won't."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00828"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;I say this, that if the committee come to the resolution to examine the hon. member for Derby, or if any other hon. member shall be examined, I, as member for Colchester, will interrogate that man, and it will not be in the hon. gentleman's power to prevent me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00829"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, the hon. member would certainly have a right to examine any witness at the bar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00830"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> said, that his hon. friend (Mr. Crompton) evidently spoke under the impulse of very strong feeling. He should therefore recommend to the committee, that, in the state of excitation under which his hon. friend laboured at that moment, the question should be adjourned, and his hon. friend's examination taken at a future day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00831"><member>Mr. Crompton</member><membercontribution> said, he never would dispute the power of the House; but he would say, that he never would be examined at their bar until it was made an order of the committee. He would not, at the nod or beck of any individual, come forward to disclose his private affairs. He was perfectly ready to bow to the decision of the House. They were deliberating upon a very important question, on which they were justified in procuring all the information they could; but he would not be bullied into any thing by any individual; and to that individual he would say, "When you are ready to lay open all the transactions of your life, and let the public judge of them, am I ready to do the same" [cries of "hear," and "order."]</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00832"><member>The Chairman</member><membercontribution> said, he must again suggest to the committee, that no member could be examined contrary to his inclination.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00833"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, he had never before heard that any member of that House possessed within it, a privilege which exempted him from such examination, if it were the pleasure of the House to require that he should undergo it. The case was very different in respect of applications of this sort proceeding from the other House; for nothing was more reasonable than that one branch of the legis-
<col>1070</col>
lature should extend its protection over one of its own members, in reference to any jurisdiction exercised by the other. That was a privilege (the party being examined only upon his personal consent) which was essential to the relative independence of the two Houses of parliament. But assuredly the House of Commons was competent to put one of its own members upon his examination.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00834"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> said, the hon. member for Derby had misunderstood him if he had supposed him to say that he would exercise any personal interference. He had spoken merely as a member of the House. But in answer to what had fallen from the hon. member for Derby respecting the transactions of his life, he would tell that hon. member, that if he chose to move for an inquiry into all the transactions in which he (Mr. Harvey) had been engaged, from his cradle until the present moment, he should be ready and willing to go into the inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00835"><member>Sir R. Wilson</member><membercontribution> said, there was an evident misunderstanding on the part of the hon. member for Derby, in supposing that the hon. member for Colchester had attempted to exercise any improper jurisdiction. But a question had arisen, as to whether the House had the power of examining one of its own members against that member's inclination. It appeared to be the opinion of some, that a member, if he pleased, could protect himself under his privilege. Now the best way of settling this question, would be to move, "that the hon. member for Derby be examined in his place."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00836"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he was sorry that the hon. gentleman who had proposed that Mr. Crompton should be examined, should have prefaced his motion by the observations which he had made. It was true that that hon. gentleman had not said that he would exercise any [improper jurisdiction; but then it would have been better if he had abstained altogether from making any reference to the share which Mr. Crompton had taken in this investigation. An observation which the hon. gentleman had made, appeared to him to justify the warmth which it had excited in the hon. member for Derby, he meant the observation that whatever delicacy he (Mr. D. W. Harvey) might have felt in moving, "that the hon. member for Derby should be examined," was removed by the part which that hon.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0543"/>
<col>1071</col>
member had taken in the investigation. It was not his wish to throw any difficulty in the way of the hon. member for Derby being examined, if the House wished that he should be examined; but he really thought it would be better to postpone that examination, when it was considered that the hon. member was under a degree of excitement, from which he ought to be entirely free, when undergoing any examination, but more especially the examination of the hon. member who had occasioned the excitement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00837"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> concurred in the propriety of postponing the motion until it could be considered with better temper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00838"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> assured the hon. member for Derby, that he did not mean any thing disrespectful when he proposed his examination. He thought that if that hon. member had been silent, it would have been more delicate; but as that hon. member had taken part in the discussion, he thought it as well to examine him. He had stated to several hon. members, before the occurrence of this evening, that it was his opinion that both Mr. Evans and Mr. Crompton ought to be called to the bar of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00839"><member>Mr. Crompton</member><membercontribution> said, he conceived the hon. member to have censured him for taking a part in the examination.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00840"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> said, that in his opinion, there had been evidence enough given on the subject last session. Under these circumstances he had no intention to call on the hon. member for Derby. He had other witnesses whom he could call if the House pleased, but he considered his case to be fully established, and was ready to close it at any time. It was no longer his case, but that of the committee.<lb/>
The motion was withdrawn, and William Leadbeater was then called. Alderman Waithman desired the evidence which this witness had given on a preceding occasion, in which he denied having received any money, to be read. The evidence was read, and the witness examined by alderman Waithman.&#x2014;He recollected having given that evidence, meant to abide by it; persisted in it. Had said that he never received money in the presence of Mr. Hannam, and would now abide by that. Mr. Alderman Waithman desired Hannam's evidence to be read, in which he stated that Leadbeater had been paid in his presence. The evidence was read accordingly</membercontribution></p>
<col>1072</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00841"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;What have you to say to that evidence?&#x2014;Witness.&#x2014;I positively deny it. I still persist in the evidence I gave. I am innocent of it; Hannam was then called in and identified Leadbeater.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00842"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> then moved, that it was the opinion of the committee that Leadbeater having been guilty of gross and wilful falsehood, be committed to Newgate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00843"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that although he had no difficulty in inflicting the other evening that punishment upon a man who had, in an examination before the House, committed wilful perjury, yet felt some doubts as to the propriety of pursuing the same course in a case where a witness was merely contradicted by the testimony of others, and that testimony not confirmed by any other incontestible evidence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00844"><member>Mr. Benett</member><membercontribution> said, they could not have stronger testimony against any man, and thought it necessary to the dignity of the House that he should be committed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00845"><member>Mr. Twiss</member><membercontribution> said, the witness might not be speaking the truth, but the House had not heard the evidence which might be produced on his part to disprove what was said by his accusers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00846"><member>Mr. Benett</member><membercontribution> expressed his surprise that the learned gentleman should have any doubts upon the subject. The evidence of two respectable witnesses was all that was required to hang a man for felony, and yet the House paused upon that testimony in a case like the present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00847"><member>Mr. Twiss</member><membercontribution> repeated his assertion, that the witness might be able to disprove what was asserted by other evidence, and that he ought to be allowed the same time and notice for that purpose as a criminal put upon his trial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00848"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, that the testimony of Leadbeater had excited suspicion before he was confronted with Hannam and Newton, and the House ought to recollect that he was the son of the bell-man, who distributed all the money.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00849"><member>The Attorney-general</member><membercontribution> said, he had no difficulty in stating, that the evidence of two was preferable to that of one, still he did not see that this witness could be committed on the evidence of two other parties, without having an opportunity afforded him of proving his statement. This was always the case in prosecutions for perjury. He recommended that the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0544"/>
<col>1073</col>
man should have an opportunity of meeting the testimony against him. He never would consent to a man's being committed by that House upon mere suspicion. The ordinary rules and principles of justice must be attended to, if the honour and dignity of the House was to be upheld.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00850"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> observed, that the House was not bound in its proceedings by the same strictness of rule which governed a court of law. It was to be recollected, that although a man accused before parliament of perjury had not the same advantages of defence that he would have in a court of law, the punishment inflicted upon him in case of conviction was considerably lighter. Unless the House acted with decision, it would be impossible for it to obtain the truth. If persons like the witness, were assured of the forbearance of the House, they had only to deny stoutly every thing that was alleged against them, and it would be impossible either to have the facts ascertained, or guilt brought home to the offending party.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00851"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, that the House would do well to be extremely cautious in its proceedings; since a hasty decision, whatever might be the quantum of personal suffering inflicted upon the individual, had the effect of casting indelible disgrace upon his character. In a court of law, the judge told the jury, in summing up the evidence, that if there was doubt in their minds they must give the prisoner the benefit of it. Now, in this case he had doubts, and he could not bring himself to vote for the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00852"><member>Sir J. Wrottesley</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that the assimilation of the House to a court of law was totally untenable. The object was, to obtain truth by simple and comprehensive examination, and to substitute common sense for legal subtlety. It was abundantly clear, from the evidence, that this man had received election money upon three several occasions. He did not see how it was possible for the House to shut their eyes to the notorious fact, and should certainly vote for the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00853"><member>Mr. Twiss</member><membercontribution> contended, that no man ought to be declared guilty upon any charge without having an opportunity of being heard in his defence. This was principle of common justice, not peculiar to courts of law, but recognized by every tribunal in the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00854"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> thought there was sufficient
<col>1074</col>
evidence to support the resolution. When false evidence had been given, the dignity of the House required that they should take notice of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00855"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he could not concur with the noble lord, that because the House inflicted a less heavy punishment for perjury than would be inflicted by a court of law, it was on that account the less bound to be governed by the same principles of law and justice. Though the physical suffering inflicted by a sentence of the House might be comparatively trivial, it was to be remembered that by that sentence the character of an honest man, and even a man in the highest station of life, might be blasted for ever. Though the evidence before the House might warrant a moral conviction, it did not seem to him sufficiently clear to send a man to Newgate upon. It was just possible that the witnesses who deposed to the fact of Leadbeater's having received money, might have an interest in what they stated. The lists only proved that there had been an intention to pay him, not that he had been paid: the individuals who spoke to his having been paid, were those to whom money had been intrusted for his payment; and the House would observe that as these were transactions in which no receipts were given, the payment or non-payment must stand upon the allegation of the individual. He confessed that he was disposed, before Leadbeater was committed to Newgate, to call in the witnesses who had contradicted him, and re-examine them.<lb/>
William Leadbeater was again called to the bar; when the chairman told him that there was strong evidence to induce the committee to doubt whether he had not been stating falsehoods. He gave him that caution before he entered upon his re-examination. The witness was then examined by Mr. Peel; in answer to whose questions he stated, that he had voted at the last election; that he had heard election money mentioned at East Retford; that he did not know what it meant; that he had been induced to vote for sir R. Dundas, because he had been canvassed for him and preferred him; that he had never asked his brother whether he had received election money; that he had never heard of such a person as Pickup; that he had never seen him at an inn at East Retford; that he should
<image src="S2V0018P0I0545"/>
<col>1075</col>
not know him if he were to see him now; that it was last month that he was at Hannam's office, when Hannam produced the list of voters; that he was not near enough to the paper to see the names; that Newton was not in the room; that he went to Hannam's about magistrate's business; that Hannam began talking about the list, and told him with a smile that his name was upon it; that he had no curiosity to ask Hannam what his name was on the list for; that Hannam did not ask him if he had received any money; that he did not now know what election money meant; that he could not guess at all what it meant; that he might have heard something about twenty guineas; that he could not tell what that meant; that he did not know that that sum was to be paid to the voter who voted for the successful candidate; that he did not expect that sum; that he did not know that any voter had had it; that he did not know that it would be wrong to take it; that he did not know there was any secret about it; that he had never heard at Retford of the expression; "just and right;" that if any candidate had said so to him, he should not have known what it meant; that he was not aware that his name was in the list which had been delivered in by Mrs. Thornton; that he had had no dealings with her husband; that he had never received 21<i>l</i>. from him; that he had never heard him talk of election money; that he did not know that there was any other William Leadbeater than himself in East Retford; that he had never found a packet which he did not expect; that he had never heard of such a thing; that he had never heard of packets having been left at the houses of voters; that he knew most of the burgesses of East Retford; that none of them ever mentioned such a thing to him, &amp;c.<lb/>
The witness was then ordered to withdraw, and the question was put&#x2014;" That William Leadbeater had been guilty of gross and wilful falsehoods in his evidence given before the committee." On a division, there appeared&#x2014;for the motion, 106; against it 15; Majority 91.<lb/>
The House was then resumed. Mr. Gordon reported the resolution, which was agreed to; and it was ordered that for the said offence, Leadbeater be committed to Newgate. The House having again resolved itself into a committee, Mr. Tennyson said, that he had concluded his case; and moved, that if counsel were

<title>EAST RETFORD DISFRANCHISEMENT<lb/> BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00860">Jonathan Fox being called in, upon the motion of Mr. Lumley, to be discharged, the SPEAKER addressed him as follows:</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00861">"Jonathan Fox, the offence for which you were committed to his Majesty's gaol of Newgate, was that of suppressing the truth, when examined as a witness before a committee of this House. It is an offence of immense magnitude. It is obvious that if such an offence were to be tolerated, or suffered to pass with impunity, the ends of justice must be defeated, and the dignity and character of this House impaired. The House, therefore, had no alternative but to adopt the Resolution under which you were imprisoned.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00862">"Since your imprisonment, you have approached this House by petition: In that petition you express to the House the feebleness of your health at the time you were examined; you express your entire respect and deference to the House; and you express also your sincere regret and contrition: It is because the House believe the explanation you have given, and because they rely upon the sincerity of regret and contrition you have expressed, and because they are satisfied that their
<image src="S2V0018P0I0546"/>
<col>1077</col>
conduct can, neither by you nor by any one else, be misconstrued, that I am directed, so early after your imprisonment, to inform you that you are discharged, on the payment of your fees."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00863">Jonathan Fox was ordered to withdraw. Mr. Tennyson then moved the order of the day, for going into a committee on the East Retford Disfranchisement bill.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00864"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> said, that having, on Friday, intimated an intention of examining a member of the House on the subject of this bill, he would apprize the House, before he stated the reasons which induced him to make the motion, of what had passed between that hon. member and himself. Being desirous, on every occasion, to observe the maxim&#x2014;"Do unto others as you would wish to be done by," he addressed a letter to Mr. Crompton, stating his intention of persevering in the motion, and desiring to know whether Mr. Crompton would attend voluntarily, or prefer attending by a compulsory order of the House. In answer to that communication, he received a letter from Mr. Crompton to the following effect:&#x2014;"That it was not his present intention to be in his place in the House on Monday next, and in case he wished to change his intention, he would inform Mr. Harvey of that circumstance; that, according to his present views, he would rather be in his place some day subsequent to Wednesday; but that Mr. Crompton's colds were so tedious, as to leave him no chance of attending without making himself ill." In consequence of this letter, he should move that Mr. Crompton attend the committee on Friday next. He would now briefly state the reasons which induced him to make the motion. Since last Friday he had read all the evidence taken, not only at the bar of the House, but before the committee appointed to try the merits of the election; and the impression which he had entertained on Friday evening was strengthened by that perusal. It should be recollected, that the object of this bill was that of punishment, by striking the borough out of the political map of the country. The bill was not introduced upon the principle of general reform, but upon the principle of applying reform in any particular case in which palpable malfeasance should be proved. Acting upon this principle, there were three courses of proceeding. The first and most lenient was that of punishing only particular indi-
<col>1078</col>
viduals who had been guilty of corruption; their numbers, as contrasted with the entire body, being so trifling as to render it inexpedient, as well as unjust, to extend the punishment beyond the transgressing party. The second case was that in which a considerable portion of the constituent body had been found guilty of corrupt practices. The third was that of entire extinction of the right of election&#x2014;the severest measure of punishment which could be applied to the political offender. In proof of misconduct requiring the last description of punishment, the hon. member who had introduced the bill had endeavoured to show a uniform and long-continued system of corruption; and, in pursuance of this plan he had pointed out three distinct periods in which corrupt practices had almost touched every person at the bar. The evidence relating to 1812, when Mr. Osbaldeston and Mr. Marsh were returned, was conclusive as to the manner in which Mr. Osbaldeston had secured that return. He then travelled to 1818, and placed at the bar an individual who had just been so correctly admonished, of the name of Fox, and the gist of his evidence was, that he had deposited in the hands of the Retford bankers, shortly after the election of 1818, the sum of 2,800<i>l.</i> On being interrogated as to the mode in which that sum was to be applied, he, at first, declared his total forgetfulness of the way in which the money was to be applied, but, on being admonished of the consequences, he admitted that he had an impression, that that sum of money was given over to the bellman to be distributed amongst the burgesses. He (Mr. Harvey) asked the House, whether that was a species of evidence upon which they were prepared to come to a decision, that gross corruption universally prevailed in the borough of Retford in 1818? The witness stated, however, that he could inform the committee in what way the money was disposed of, provided he was furnished with a paper in the possession of Mr. Crompton, in which were contained the names of every member who was to be a recipient in the distribution of the money. There was, therefore, a frightful chasm in the evidence, which it was in the power of the House to supply by the examination of the proper person. It might so happen that Mr. Crompton had never given an order&#x2014;that he had drawn the money for a legitimate purpose; and, in that case,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0547"/>
<col>1079</col>
the burgesses of Retford would be exonerated from the imputation which now lay upon them. It was the duty of the House to examine all parties who could elucidate these facts. Could any person who had read the evidence conceal from himself the impression, that it was in Mr. Crompton's power to supply the defect in the testimony of Fox? Could it be believed that Fox had distributed the money, unless there was some additional testimony to confirm his statement, or remove the odium under which the electors of East Retford laboured? It was not necessary to refer to authorities to prove that it was competent to pursue such a course. It was not an unusual course for the House to order its members to attend, to undergo that examination which the course of justice, or the supply of facts, might render essential; he could not consider that such an interrogation would press remarkably hard upon this hon. gentleman, because he could not conceal from himself that the hon. gentleman was abundantly sustained by example and sympathy in the House; for it would be ridiculous to suppose that the hon. gentleman was the only person who had entered the portals of the House by the means which he was suspected to have used on this occasion. He, therefore, disclaimed any personal feeling against the hon. member; but thus much he must say, that we should be dealing out a most severe measure of justice, if it could so be called, towards these unfortunate individuals, many of whom were in the humblest condition of life, if while we exterminated their political rights for receiving the value of their rights (for it was nothing more), we threw round the members of the House the powerful and omnipotent shield of parliament, to guard them from similar exposition. There was another consideration to which he was desirous of calling the attention of the House. It ought to be recollected that this report came down expressly recommended for the purpose of drawing attention to the peculiar facts disclosed in it. A few weeks since, some of the standing orders of the House were circulated amongst the members, amongst which he read this:&#x2014;"That it was a high infringement of the liberties and privileges of the Commons of the United Kingdom for any Lord of Parliament to concern himself in the election of members to serve for the Commons in parliament." Could any gentleman have read the report which
<col>1080</col>
had emanated from the committee, without being struck with the direct evidence which was to be found in it of a palpable interference of a Lord of Parliament; that Lord having paid the sum of 1,200<i>l.</i> into the Retford bank, to be applicable to those purposes into which the House was now inquiring. The House was looked up to as the guardian of the constitution; but was it not undermining the constitution to suffer the purchase of the votes of the constituent body? It was impossible the House could terminate its inquiries on this report. He would move, "That S. Crompton, Esq. do, in his place, attend the committee of the whole House, to whom the East Retford Disfranchisement bill is referred."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00865"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> expressed his dissent from the greater part of the observations of the hon. member. He did not think any evidence was wanted to prove general corruption in the borough. Some hon. members had entertained doubts and scruples which surpassed his comprehension. They seemed to forget things in the evidence, that an unexceptionable witness, named Thornton, had produced accounts as well kept as they could be in any merchant's counting-house: there were not only the sums paid, but all the persons receiving the money. He thought this a most convincing fact. The only circumstance which made him feel any difficulty in rejecting Mr. Crompton's testimony was, that the world would say that the House acted inconsistently, if not unjustly, in treating persons of a humble class in life with great severity, for an offence which they overlooked when it was committed by one of its own members. He had no wish to examine Mr. Crompton; for he wanted no further evidence to make up his judgment; but he thought that the House ought to consider, whether it would not injure its own character with the country if it failed to command the attendance of that gentleman.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00866"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, he would take that opportunity of informing the hon. member for Bletchingley, that he did not consider the evidence, as it now stood, sufficient to disfranchise the borough of East Retford. The evidence of Hannam varied materially from that of Pickup; and he should wish to have both those witnesses re-examined with a view of seeing whether the discrepancy in their evidence could be reconciled. He also was of opinion, that the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0548"/>
<col>1081</col>
banker at Retford, Mr. Foljambe, should be examined. As the evidence stood at present, it appeared that there were two cases at the election in 1826, in which promises of votes were given in consequence of its being understood, from a declaration of Mr. Foljambe, that at the end of the election "all would be right," meaning thereby that a sum of money would be paid to the voters. Now it was material to the present inquiry to know whether those two cases were true or not. Mr. Foljambe had denied the truth of them before the committee up stairs, and it was upon his evidence that that committee had declared the sitting members not to have been guilty of bribery. He should therefore wish to examine Mr. Foljambe on this point at the bar of the House. There was also another point on which he considered the attendance of Mr. Foljambe necessary; he meant with respect to that part of the case which related to the powerful influence which appeared behind Mr. Foljambe: that influence which had advanced 1,200/. in two sums for the purposes of the last election. Mr. Foljambe had stated, that the sum of 1,200<i>l.</i> was all that he expected to receive from that quarter for electioneering purposes. He should like to ascertain whether that was the case or not; because if it were, the inference from it would be that the sum of twenty guineas would not have been paid to the electors after the election, supposing that it had never been questioned. Painful as it might be to his feelings, he wished to have the attendance of Mr. Crompton at the bar, if it could be procured; but he did not see that Mr. Crompton ought to attend, if he felt a strong reluctance to such a measure. He now gave notice, that if Mr. Crompton should be ordered to attend at the bar on a future day, he would move that Mr. Hammond, Mr. Pickup, and Mr. Foljambe, be ordered to attend on the same day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00867"><member>Mr. Sykes</member><membercontribution> said, he merely rose to state to the House the situation of Mr. Crompton. His hon. friend had intended to have met the challenge of the hon. member for Colchester; but he was at present too much indisposed to come down to the House. He held in his hand a medical certificate from a gentleman of the highest character in his profession, stating that Mr. Crompton was so ill that he could not attend that night in his place without extreme danger. He had himself seen Mr.
<col>1082</col>
Crompton, and he could say from his own knowledge, that he was not in a state of health in which he ought to be examined. Mr. Crompton, therefore, required a delay of two or three days. He had no intention whatever of avoiding any examination which the House might think it was his duty to meet. He reposed his honour securely in the House, and having so reposed it, he was willing to undergo any examination. At the same time, he entertained great doubts as to the competency of the House to put to him any questions which by their answers might involve him in a criminal prosecution. So much he had thought it right to say on behalf of his hon. friend. He would now say a word or two in his own person on the present motion. He was not going to deny the right of the House to order Mr. Crompton to attend, but he thought the House was bound to consider the expediency of exercising that right. If the hon. member for Bletchingly, who had conducted this case with the candour and the clearness of a lawyer, had closed it without thinking it expedient to call on Mr. Crompton to give evidence, the House might be inclined to pause before it did so, for no other purpose than to gratify&#x2014;he would not say the spleen, for that would not be parliamentary, but the curiosity of the hon. member for Colchester, in matters with which that hon. member had no business to interfere. Why was Mr. Crompton the only person to be called to give evidence on this question, when Mr. Osbaldeston and Mr. Evans, who were equally implicated, were not called? Mr. Crompton had indiscreetly, considering his situation, but still competently as regarded his character as a member of parliament, proceeded to examine one of the witnesses produced on this inquiry, and it was not till some dissatisfaction had been excited by the indiscretion of which he was guilty, that the idea arose of examining him. Under such circumstances, he put it to the House to consider whether they ought to call Mr. Crompton to the bar. For his own part he would say that Mr. Crompton, if he were called upon to appear there, would have reason to complain of a violation of that candour and delicacy which he had a right to expect would be shown him by his brother members.<lb/>
A Member, whose name we could not learn, stated several circumstances to the House, with a view of showing that there
<image src="S2V0018P0I0549"/>
<col>1083</col>
was no occasion to call Mr. Foljambe to the bar as a witness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00868"><member>Mr. Lumley</member><membercontribution> considered that there was no necessity for examining Mr. Crompton.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00869"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> said, that the question of the propriety of calling Mr. Foljambe as a witness to the bar had been so ably disposed of by the hon. gentleman on the other side, that he felt himself excused from the necessity of saying a word upon the subject. Under the peculiar circumstances in which that gentleman was placed, he felt that he should not be justified in summoning him as a witness before them. "With respect to the observations which his hon. and learned friend had made upon Mr. Foljambe's connexion with a part of the case proved before the committee up stairs, all he had to say was this, that the conduct of earl Fitzwilliam, as there disclosed, had no bearing whatever on the case which he had undertaken to lay before the House. If his hon. and learned friend had any charge to make against that noble individual, it was for his hon. and learned friend to bring it forward as a substantive charge against a peer of parliament. As he had been obliged to touch upon the conduct of earl Fitzwilliam, he thought it mere justice to the character of that illustrious nobleman to add, that though it had appeared that he had advanced 1,200<i>l.</i> for the purpose of that election, it did not appear that he had advanced it for any corrupt purposes. It was advanced for the defrayment of those legitimate expenses which every body knew were allowed at elections; and he must say, that he saw no harm in a peer's advancing 1,200<i>l.</i> for the payment of the legitimate expenses of his nephew's return to parliament. Such being the position in which earl Fitzwilliam stood, he thought that his hon. and learned friend would have done better if he had not alluded to it. No one looked with greater jealousy than he did to the interference of peers at elections; and, as a proof of it, he would refer to his own conduct some years ago, when he brought under consideration the proceedings of the duke of Marlborough at an election for Oxford.&#x2014;As to the motion, for the attendance of Mr. Crompton, he had only a few words to say. It was indifferent to him how far the House might proceed in its examinations. He thought he had already made out a case amply sufficient to justify the House in disfranchising this borough. He was most anxious to go at the
<col>1084</col>
earliest opportunity into the examination of the question and into a division upon its merits. He regretted the delays which had taken place, and considered them extremely disadvantageous. At the same time, he was sure that if the House was not tired of these examinations, the further they were continued the clearer they would show the corruption of the borough.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00870"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that on the subject of the examination of their members in the manner proposed, the information furnished by the current of authorities was rather of a complex kind. No committee had, he thought, a power to originate a motion for the examination of any witness whether he were a member or not, without receiving an order from the House. Among the authorities, there were several instances of orders for the examination of witnesses, with the superadded words, "if they should think fit." On the whole, however, he was disposed to assume, that the House, if it pleased, had the power to examine members as witnesses in any business before them. He knew that there were instances of members having at first refused to be examined, but who had submitted after some wavering; in no instance had the House proceeded, as far as he could learn, to commit to the Tower in case of a refusal. For his own part, being satisfied on the point to which alone he thought Mr. Crompton could be examined, he saw no necessity for calling upon that hon. member. Still, as this was a case in which they had to decide judicially, and where their decision ought alone to be founded upon the uninfluenced operation of their consciences, he would yield his opinion, should it appear that any number of hon. members were anxious to have Mr. Crompton examined. He cared little for the prevalence of any feeling elsewhere, that they would be disposed to screen one of their own members: all he should ask himself was, ought this particular course to be taken? Because, if he felt it ought, he would do it, regardless of popular impressions. If many hon. members were desirous of examining Mr. Crompton, then he thought it quite clear that in the course of such examination no question should be put which could expose the witness to penalties, or to his being placed in an unfavourable situation elsewhere. The examination should not be conducted with any view of criminating the hon. member himself, but solely for the purpose of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0550"/>
<col>1085</col>
ascertaining in what degree the borough of East Retford had been corrupt, and whether it ought to be disfranchised. It had been already proved by Fox, that 2,840<i>l.</i> had been lodged in a bank to pay the electors. It was to that point only that Mr. Crompton could be interrogated; and as they had the information already, what necessity was there of having it repeated? However, if any hon. member thought the evidence material to add a link to the chain, he certainly would not oppose it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00871"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> thought there was not a shadow of doubt as to the power of the House to direct the examination of a member. In a committee of the whole House, every member had a right to put such questions as he thought fit to any other member. In this instance, he did not see sufficient grounds for the delay which would result from Mr. Crompton's examination, and, therefore he should vote against it. At the same time he proceeded only on the impressions of his own mind; and if he thought there were many members who wished to hear the evidence of Mr. Crompton, he would vote for his examination. As he considered it most important that every thing concerning the power of the House should be clearly understood, he would repeat, that he was clearly of opinion, that in a committee of the whole House, every member had a perfect and unquestionable right to examine any other member, without any fresh orders from the House. In the case of colonel Wardle, on the charges against the duke of York, no order had been made that he should attend in his place; but being called upon to answer some question, and having objected that one member of the committee should call on another, lord Colchester, then Speaker of the House, sitting as a member of the committee, stated, that no member could refuse to be examined before a committee of the whole House. But it was said, suppose the member should object, the committee had no power to enforce his attendance. The committee could do in this case what they could do in any other similar instance. They would report the fact to the House, and obtain its interference. This was the course they always followed. In the cases of the witnesses who had been guilty of prevarication and false evidence in this investigation, the committee had invoked the authority of
<col>1086</col>
the House. That no member was privileged to disobey the resolution of the House, was proved in the instance of three members who were concerned in the South Sea Company. They had objected on the ground of their oaths of office, and those oaths they had taken as members of the Privy Council, but the House overruled the plea, and on the report of the committee, they were committed to the custody of the Serjeant at Arms, That was going as far in the way of compulsion as the House could well do. There could be no doubt as to the authority of the House over its members: it must be complete, or its proceedings might be totally paralysed. With regard to the question before the House, he did not see any necessity for acceding to the motion. He would always object that any witness should criminate himself, unless it was absolutely necessary to the ends of justice. It had been suggested that some individual might be present not belonging to the House, who might hear this evidence and give it afterwards in testimony before some court of justice. But no court, he was sure, would admit hearsay evidence of what had passed at the bar of that House. The only satisfactory evidence in a court of justice would be the short-hand minutes of that evidence taken by order of the House, but there was no danger that that evidence would ever be produced before any court of justice. He was aware there was some inconvenience not resulting directly from the evidence, but which might flow from it as a probable consequence in some cases; and that was, that the evidence itself, though it could not be produced against the party, might lead to the discovery of other testimony injurious to him. On that ground, bills had been sent down from the other House, in some cases, to indemnify the witnesses generally against all penalties and forfeitures they might have incurred by reason of any act of which they might give credence. He thought that principle so just and reasonable, that he wished to see it extended to all cases of inquiry before either the House of Parliament, or any committee of either.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00872"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, there was not a shadow of difference between his right hon. friend and himself as to the power of the House to compel the attendance of any member to be examined before a committee. The result of his inquiry was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0551"/>
<col>1087</col>
distinctly in favour of the existence of that power. A member stood in the same relation to a committee as any other individual. He did not claim for him any indemnity that he did not claim for every other individual.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00873"><member>Lord Howick</member><membercontribution> said, that if the only question was, whether the evidence of Mr. Crompton was or was not necessary to make out the case against the borough of East Retford, he should vote for that hon. gentleman's examination. But he wished to argue the question on higher grounds. If the laws against bribery were constantly enforced, he would say, by all means discover all the parties guilty of corruption in these cases. But as it was notorious that nine tenths of the members who sat for boroughs in that House were returned either by bribes of money, or money's worth, he saw no reason to select any particular individual, and make him a scape-goat for the sins of others. The House could neither deceive itself nor the country; and he would say, unless the House was determined to adopt some general rule to suppress bribery, and to carry it in all instances into execution, he would not concur in inflicting what he must otherwise consider only a cruel and useless punishment. He should certainly vote for the bill, as the burgesses of East Retford had no right to use their privileges for selfish or corrupt purposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00874"><member>Sir R. Wilson</member><membercontribution> said, that some hon. members had stated that they considered the examination of Mr. Crompton necessary to establish facts. He for one was prepared to vote for the disfranchisement of the borough on the evidence he had heard. But he thought it very strange, that members, who differed from him as to the sufficiency of the evidence, should join with him in refusing to hear further evidence. It had been stated, that the proposition to examine Mr. Crompton had originated in personal feelings; but the hon. member for Colchester had solemnly disclaimed the imputation. That hon. gentleman had stated that he held the examination of Mr. Crompton necessary, to enable him to arrive safely at the conclusion, which, as a judge, he must draw from the evidence before him. As to the objection that Mr. Crompton might, by some of his answers, subject himself to prosecution, he disregarded it; for the committee would prevent the hon. gentleman, from giving any answer which might
<col>1088</col>
expose him to any proceedings out of that House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00875"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> said, he was quite at a loss to account for the imputation so pointedly made against him by the hon. member for Hull, that he was influenced by feelings of spleen towards Mr. Crompton. He disclaimed solemnly that he had not felt the slightest spleen towards the hon. gentleman. As to what had been said by the hon. member who conducted the inquiry he would reply to him in the words of Sterne, "that the ass had sought his master as much only as the master had sought the ass." He had been induced to interfere in this inquiry in consequence of two gentlemen, connected with East Retford, having called upon him, who, after presenting that hon. gentleman's compliments, had stated, that he would feel personally obliged if he would give his aid in conducting this investigation. The persons who had thus induced him to intrude sat at that moment under the gallery, at the bar of the House. He had told them at that time, that, in his opinion, the inquiry would be mere trifling, if the committee did not call, not only on Mr. Crompton but on Mr. Evans. He knew nothing of Mr. Osbaldeston till he heard of him in the course of this inquiry, and he would have been as ready to have called him if it had been necessary. But there was no occasion for doing that, as they had had his agent Pickup, before them, who had stated, that he had taken the money for the express purpose of paying the voters; and they had also had Hannam before them, who had assisted Pickup on that occasion. Here there was a complete identification of a corrupt purpose. Not so with respect to Mr. Crompton; for, from all that appeared in the evidence of Fox, he might still be in possession of the 2,840<i>l.</i> He called on the hon. gentleman, who had been so dexterous in the management of his case, to state why he had not produced the evidence of dozens of persons who might have been found to prove that they had received the sealed parcels? Fox stated, that 2,840<i>l.</i> had been made up in parcels of twenty-one guineas each. Why had no witness been called who had received one of these parcels? There was another reason why it was important Mr. Crompton should be examined. There was no evidence that that hon. gentleman, though lie had spent money in 1812, had, laid out
<image src="S2V0018P0I0552"/>
<col>1089</col>
sixpence in the election of 1818, for any corrupt purpose. This, if it was proved to be true, would be strong testimony to show the improved character of the burgesses. He believed that the time was gone by when the hon. member could incur any penalties for what he might say, though perhaps at common law he might still be responsible; and, for any thing he knew, the very first question that might be asked, would lead to that liability which he agreed ought to be avoided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00876"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. gentleman had been misled; for he had not sent his compliments to him, or any message on the subject. With respect to the present question, if he had abstained from calling for the evidence of Mr. Crompton, Mr. Evans, or Mr. Osbaldeston, he had done so, not from any desire of preventing their exposure, but because he had been given to understand that those gentlemen would be unable to prove the receipt of money by the burgesses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00877"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> recommended the hon. member to withdraw his motion. If it went to a division, he should not vote for it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00879"><member>Mr. D. W.

If he stood alone he would divide the House thirty times. If, however, the House were satisfied as to the purity of his motives, he should not press for a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00880"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he could bear testimony to the fact, that the hon. member for Colchester upon a former evening, and before any of the imputations alluded to had been made, had pressed as anxiously for the examination of Mr. Crompton as he had done upon the present occasion.

<title>MUTINY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00882">On the report of the Mutiny Bill being brought up,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00883"><member>Lord Nugent</member><membercontribution> rose, pursuant to notice, to move a clause for preventing corporal punishment in the army. In bringing
<col>1090</col>
forward this amendment, the noble lord expressed his anxiety to avoid every topic and argument which might be calculated to excite feelings of irritation here or elsewhere. The subject was one surrounded with difficulty and delicacy, and nothing but an imperative sense of duty could have induced him to press it upon the attention of the House. He held it to be an incontrovertible fact, that the king, amongst his other prerogatives, possessed the power of not only controlling the army, but also of regulating and enforcing its discipline according to his discretion, subject to the laws enacted for that purpose, and under the sanction of that House. It was a fallacy to contend, that, because the soldier had voluntarily subjected himself to this disgraceful punishment, they should not legislate upon the subject, and decide as to the propriety and utility of this portion of military discipline. Even granting for a moment that the soldier has no grounds for complaint, he would still ask; first, was this a proper sort of punishment to exhibit before those who were the natives of a free country, and accustomed to civil liberty; secondly, was it a punishment conducive to the maintenance of those feelings and of that spirit in the army, which it was so desirable to uphold and preserve? Lastly, though first in importance, came the question&#x2014;Could a substitute be found for this disgraceful and humiliating punishment? If there was any practicable and safe substitute,&#x2014;any escape whatever from the infliction of a punishment degrading at once to him who suffered it, and to the service which admitted it,&#x2014;sure he was, that the House would gladly adopt it. He was equally confident that every hon. and gallant officer who heard him would participate in the sentiment, and would be ready to admit, from the improved practice and feeling of the army, that any substitute of sufficient example would be highly desirable. The opinions of the officers in the army coincided with his own, that, if practicable, a substitute ought to be found for this degrading punishment. Upon that point he did not imagine there were two opinions in that House. The exhibitions to which this disgraceful species of punishment gave rise, familiarized the public mind, more particularly in garrison towns, to scenes to which it should never be accustomed. The noble lord proceeded to advert to the cruelty and injustice of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0553"/>
<col>1091</col>
punishment. It was not calculated to maintain that chivalrous spirit which should always characterize the military service. In such a profession, it was impossible not to associate disgrace and infamy with stripes and blows, and it was hard that such a punishment should be inflicted upon a poor soldier, perhaps for his first offence; it was hard that a degrading mark should be put upon him which would follow him through life, and accompany him to the grave. Some gentlemen might consider these to be high-flown sentiments, but to such he would put this question. He believed there was not a more powerful inducement to lead a soldier on in hishonourable career, than the hope, that at the end of many years he might win his way to promotion. Suppose a soldier had thus obtained a commission, who in the early part of his life, and for a first offence had undergone this disgraceful punishment&#x2014;in what position was that man placed? Gentlemen should not disregard the maintenance of honourable feelings in the army, even to the lowest ranks. The noble lord illustrated this position by reference to a fact which occurred during the wars of the succession. A number of Highland officers who had followed the fortunes of the Pretender, on being obliged to leave their native country, entered into the French service, and were there formed into a distinct regiment. In one of the battles which subsequently took place, they claimed the post of honour, and, advancing in the front of the army, they bravely bore the hottest fire, until they were mown down by the enemy's cannon. The Frenchmen, on beholding such a noble exhibition, universally exclaimed <i>"Une fois gentilhomme, toujours gentilhomme&#x0021;"</i> In a Highland regiment, the soldier who suffered beneath the lash of the drum-major could never return to his country; he was an outcast and forbidden, and a stranger amongst his companions. Such was the feeling with which this degrading punishment was regarded in the Highlands. It was a species of punishment which tended to confound the gradations of crime. He understood that 200 or 300 lashes constituted the punishment for crimes of a secondary order, and yet more than 300 lashes could not be inflicted even for a capital offence, without endangering a soldier's life. Thus, when a man was ordered to receive 1,000 lasses, the number actually inflicted could
<col>1092</col>
not exceed 300; and he was glad to understand that, of late years, the disgraceful practice of bringing back a delinquent who had undergone a certain portion of his sentence, a second time to the lash, had been very properly abandoned. This punishment, like the code of Draco, which punished equally with death, the slightest as well as the most heinous offence, was calculated to confound all the gradations of crime, and to defeat the ends of salutary discipline.&#x2014;The noble lord proceeded to recommend as a substitute for flogging, that which he saw employed three or four years ago in the garrison of Gibraltar, namely, hard labour and extra service. It was not his wish that the House should interfere with the government of the army, but he was desirous that they should express a strong opinion upon this subject. The continuance of the punishment of flogging in the army, was a national reproach, and it was high time that that part of the military discipline should be reformed. The noble lord then moved, that in section 24 of the mutiny bill, which relates to corporal punishments, the words "not extending to life or death" should be omitted, and the following words inserted&#x2014;"provided always, and be it further enacted, that nothing in this act shall authorize any court-martial to direct the punishment of flogging, or any other bodily punishment, to be inflicted on any offender, except for drunkenness on actual military duty, theft, fraud, or assault, with intent to commit felony." These latter offences, to come within the meaning of the clause, must be perpetrated against a brother soldier: because in case of their being put in practice against fellow-subjects, not connected with the military profession, the individual offending came within the operation of the civil law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00884"><member>Mr. John Smith</member><membercontribution>, in seconding the motion, observed that, in his opinion, the punishment of flogging had a tendency to increase the number of crimes. He had I lately conversed with a person who had been many years the principal keeper of Newgate, and he had been assured by him, that he seldom recollected a criminal flogged at the Old Bailey who had not been committed again within less than twelve months for a new offence. A punishment of that kind invariably produced a total loss of character, and such a recklessness of consequences, that it was not a matter of surprise that the unfortunate
<image src="S2V0018P0I0554"/>
<col>1093</col>
sufferers, neither seeking nor procuring employment, were forced to have recourse to their old practices as a means of subsistence. If such was the effect of corporeal punishment upon those persons, how much more severe must it he on the soldier, exposed to disgrace before the whole of his comrades. He believed, indeed, that flogging produced in the soldier a furious and implacable spirit, which urged him on to the commission of new and more aggravated offences. The example of France cited by the noble lord, must be considered as conclusive on the subject. It had been his lot to see about 5,000 of the French troops in garrison for some time, and he did not recollect a single instance of corporeal punishment being inflicted for any offence. So great, indeed, was the horror amongst them of any degradation of that kind, that he believed the soldier would have run his bayonet through the body of the officer who should have ventured to command its infliction. In his opinion, the discipline of the army would be better preserved, and he was sure it would be more consistent with humanity, if they were to shoot a few soldiers every year, than to expose them to the horrible agony of corporeal punishment. After some observations upon the horribly disgraceful scenes which were once exhibited in the Tilt-yard, the hon. member contended, that if there was no better argument for the abolition of flogging, he would urge the propriety of discontinuing it as a punishment from the very unequal manner in which it was inflicted, and the very unequal strength of constitution which was brought to suffer it. A man embrowned by the sun, and accustomed to work without his shirt, would suffer much less from flogging than a manufacturer who was perhaps brought up to a labour less severe; and it was at the same time well known that it was in the power of the person who held the lash to make the punishment frightfully severe or comparatively trifling. For these reasons he seconded the noble lord's motion with pleasure; but he would have felt much greater pleasure in doing so, if the noble lord had proposed to abolish the punishment altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00885"><member>Sir J. Sebright</member><membercontribution>, being of an opinion diametrically opposite to that of the noble lord, and of the hon. gentleman, felt himself bound to state, in a few words, the reason of that difference. There were many persons in the House better quali-
<col>1094</col>
fied to state those reasons than he was; but as he had formerly seen a little of the service, he was desirous of saying, that he was prepared to justify the punishment of flogging, because he believed it to be absolutely necessary. That opinion, from what he had seen, he must continue to hold, until some of those who had much greater experience, and whose habits of commanding large bodies of troops, gave them knowledge upon the subject, were prepared to say that the discipline of the army could be preserved by any other species of punishment. The French army had been alluded to; but he begged the House to consider that that army was very differently constituted from the English army, while the punishments were ten times more severe. An English soldier was never confined more than forty-eight hours at one time, while a French soldier was frequently kept for an almost unlimited time in prison, and fed upon bread and water. As to the abolition of the punishment of flogging, he could speak from his own knowledge that it had been tried in every regiment in the service&#x2014;it was tried every day, and as long as possible&#x2014;flogging being only resorted to as a <i>dernier</i> resort. It ought to be recollected, that the English soldier was very much given to drinking&#x2014;a vice common, indeed, not only to the soldier, but to the nation in general, although he was glad to say it did not prevail so much as formerly among the higher classes. This vice led to very bad consequences in the army, and it was necessary to punish it with severity; but he was convinced that the army altogether was in a most efficient state, and that the British soldier was in every case treated with a kindness and delicacy beyond that shewn to any other army in the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00886"><member>Sir H. Vivian</member><membercontribution> said, he participated in all the humane sentiments which had been expressed by the noble lord and the hon. member who had seconded the amendment. No man would more readily give up the present system than he would, if he had pointed out to him a safer or a better plan. He, however, was a friend to the discipline of the army, knowing that without strict discipline, an army was infinitely more dangerous to its friends than to its enemies. His feeling was, that times might arrive when it would be absolutely necessary to have recourse to corporal punishment for the preservation of due order and. discipline; and therefore
<image src="S2V0018P0I0555"/>
<col>1095</col>
he could not consent to its abolition. In his opinion, the constant recurrence to this subject threw a sort of slur on British officers which they did not deserve, since they did not, except in extreme cases, have recourse to this punishment; and if there were any way of removing it, he was convinced that their feelings would go hand-in-hand with their duty. It was said last year, that British officers wished those who were placed under their command to crouch under the lash like spaniels. In his view of the case, the soldiers were more like their own national bull-dog, and sometimes required the strong hand of the master to be exercised to prevent them from being dangerous to their friends. In consequence of what had passed in the House last year, he had made some inquiries into the number of corporal punishments inflicted in different regiments for a given period, and the result of his inquiries was this:&#x2014;In one regiment he found sixty-eight defaulters, four courts-martial, one man punished; in a second, seventy defaulters, seventeen courts-martial, three men punished; in a third, eighty defaulters, nineteen courts-martial, two men punished; in a fourth, thirty-five defaulters, four courts-martial, two men punished; in a fifth, twenty-one defaulters, one court-martial, one man punished; and in a sixth, forty defaulters, sixteen courts-martial, three men punished; and, except in two cases, no punishment was inflicted exceeding a hundred lashes. He therefore contended, that there was no abuse of the system. The noble lord had referred to the French army; but he ought to take into consideration the difference between the manner in which the French and the British army was constituted. He was aware that no corporal punishment was inflicted in the French army; but the French soldier was liable to other punishments, infinitely more severe than any that was, or could be, inflicted on the British soldier. Besides, the British army was quartered all over the country, and it was necessary to have a powerful and efficient control over them; while the French army, on the contrary, was constantly kept in garrison towns or in barracks. In case of any crime being committed by a French soldier, he was either condemned to death, to the <i>boulet</i>, or to be placed in a garrison for life. With respect to the conduct of the British troops in the field, it was
<col>1096</col>
quite evident, from their achievements, that corporal punishment had not daunted their spirit; and with respect to their discipline, any man acquainted with what had passed in the south of France must know, that the British army were hailed as deliverers, while the French army were feared and dreaded. The gallant general proceeded to animadvert upon the impolicy of members bringing forward questions with which they were not acquainted. The noble lord, in his amendment, proposed to inflict the punishment of flogging for theft, fraud, and drunkenness; but he had totally passed over offences of a much more serious description, such as disobedience of orders, and sleeping upon their post; while he allowed the punishment of flogging for petty theft from a fellow soldier, an offence which the articles of war expressly required the commanding officer to place under the cognizance of the civil power. If a soldier was, for instance, to knock the noble lord down in the street, what punishment would he award him? And yet the noble lord and others wished to abolish all fears of that punishment which kept the military in awe, and prevented them from indulging in those acts of licentiousness, which might give some gentleman an opportunity of declaiming against the army as a disgrace to the country. After some observations upon the difference between the men taken in time of peace and those whom the officers were forced to recruit in time of war, and admitting that the punishment was not so necessary under such circumstances, the gallant general passed a high eulogium upon the feelings of kindness and affection, like unto that of a parent for his child, which existed between the officers and the soldiers of the British army; and concluded by declaring, that the expression of any strong feeling by the House was not necessary, either to prevent the infliction of unnecessary punishment, or to preserve the discipline of the army.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00887"><member>Mr. Wilbraham</member><membercontribution> strongly condemned the practice of flogging. It was a most sanguinary punishment; and, in his opinion, a disgrace to the British army. Those who opposed this practice were described as visionary speculatists; but he believed that lord Combermere would not be considered a speculatist; and that gallant officer had, in a very great degree, if not entirely, abolished, the inhuman practice
<image src="S2V0018P0I0556"/>
<col>1097</col>
of flogging in the British army in India. He could not conceive why the French, the Portuguese, the Spanish, and even the Hindoo troops, should be exempted from this punishment while it was inflicted on Englishmen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00888"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> said, that in contrasting the modes of punishment in our army with those in the French army, hon. gentlemen had spoken of the latter as though no other punishments were known in it besides solitary confinement and death. They had forgotten all the gradations of punishment; that in the French army offences were divided into two classes, the one of which consisted of faults against discipline, and the other of crimes. Faults against discipline were visited with fourteen days' confinement, being kept on bread and water for three days, and other punishments of a lenient nature. Crimes were the subject of the sentences of a court-martial, and the punishments assigned for them were <i>travail publique</i>, irons, death. He knew of no system better calculated to remove offences than a gradation of punishment like that adopted by the French, and the success of that system convinced him that it might be beneficially adopted in the English army. He was sorry that the suggestion which the hon. member for Montrose made last session had not been attended to; namely, that flogging should be confined to regiments on foreign service. He thought it well deserving the attention of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00889"><member>Colonel Lindsay</member><membercontribution> said, that hon. gentlemen ought not to forget of what class of persons the army was composed. Some of them were wayward and disorderly, and a great portion of them exactly at the age when men's passions were the most ungovernable. Physically speaking, the army was the most uncontrollable body of men in the community. And yet they had to undergo the greatest privations; were exposed to insult without the means of resenting it; and were called upon to do their duty silently and instantaneously. It was therefore absolutely necessary that such men should be restrained by a very severe code of laws. He would call upon the noble lord who wished to abolish corporal punishment in the army to say what he would substitute in its place. He was free to admit that military men were greatly indebted to hon. gentlemen, and especially to the hon. baronet, the member for Westminster, for bringing this subject
<col>1098</col>
before the House; because he was sure that they had been the means of lessening the application of corporal punishment. But there was a great difference between the abrogation of this power and the non-use of it. In his opinion, the infliction of corporal punishment ought only to take place in extreme cases; but the power of inflicting it ought not to be entirely removed. He argued this question on the same principles of humanity which hon. gentlemen on the other side so strongly insisted upon; but he came to a very different conclusion. Remove the power of inflicting corporal punishment, and the only resource, in cases of mutiny, would be death. This, then, in point of fact, was the humanity of the noble lord: leaving the military judges no mediate course, he compelled them to pronounce the sentence of death for an offence which did not deserve so severe a punishment. As to foreign armies, the punishments in them, so far from being more lenient, were much more severe than in ours, and were inflicted at the will of non-commissioned officers, and without any trial. Seeing, as he did, that the British army was able to beat the army of any other nation to which it was opposed, he was unwilling to alter the discipline under which it had been brought to its present state of perfect discipline.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00890"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, it would seem from the speech of the gallant member that the British army owed its superiority over other armies to the system of flogging that prevailed in it. Now he was by no means disposed to admit, that a practice which had a tendency to degrade the soldier, and to brutalize his mind, was a practice necessary to sustain the character of the British army. In Holland, Prussia, and in Wurtemberg, as well as in France, flogging had been abolished with the most beneficial effects: and even in Austria, and the few other places where it was continued, the flogging did not take place by removing the clothes of the soldier publicly, and punishing him in a manner so revolting to humanity as was practised in our service. When it was admitted that this punishment was not inflicted in more than one regiment out of four or five, and even then very seldom, it was evident that the perfect state of the discipline of our army was not owing to this practice. He had proposed a safe experiment; namely, that the abolition of this punishment
<image src="S2V0018P0I0557"/>
<col>1099</col>
should be extended, in the first instance, to England. They would then see what little effect this revolting species of punishment had in preserving the discipline of the army, and with what safety it might be extended to the whole British army. In this country, where, in any extraordinary case, the aid of the civil might be called in to assist the military power, he thought the experiment might with propriety be made, and he had submitted a proposition to that effect last year. In India, lord Combermere had almost altogether abolished corporal punishment. He had issued a general order, which restricted the infliction of it to stealing, marauding, and acts of gross insubordination, which would render the soldier unworthy of the military service; thereby limiting this degrading punishment to persons who had been guilty of the most infamous offences. He hoped the day was not far distant when this brutalizing practice would be altogether abolished.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00891"><member>Colonel Wood</member><membercontribution> thought that, although corporal punishment was not allowed in foreign armies, the discipline of them was preserved with greater severity than in ours, because the infliction of capital punishment was more frequent. The noble mover had attributed to him an argument which he had never used: that noble lord had made him say that, as boys were flogged at school, he saw no reasons why soldiers should not be flogged. Now, no such argument had ever fallen from his lips. He had commanded a regiment for many years, and had always introduced corporal punishment as seldom as possible. There was, perhaps, no regiment in which it had been inflicted in so few instances. He was not, however, of opinion that the punishment could be altogether done away with, although it ought to be as seldom resorted to as possible. In some instances he had had recourse to it; and there were I two in which young soldiers, on whom it had been inflicted, had thanked him for the salutary effect it had had upon them, in deterring them from continuing in a course of offences which would have led to severer punishment in the end. The British army had been contrasted with the armies of other countries. For his part, he thought the British soldiers, who had beaten all the armies that had been brought against them, had military character enough. Besides, as soon as they were disembodied, I they fell into the mass of the people, and

did not, as in France, form a particular class of the community, and, still preserving their military character, think themselves of a superior order to the rest of their fellow-subjects.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00892"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, he would not again go over the old argument upon this subject. To state the objection to what was proposed generally, it was this,&#x2014;that where there were large bodies of armed men collected together, strong measures were necessary to keep them in order. Means which might be used for this end in other countries, could not be resorted to in this. How, for instance, could the punishment, so much insisted on, of solitary confinement, be inflicted in this country? Our troops were not in strong garrisoned towns or military fortresses, where men could be confined apart from their comrades. We had no mode of imprisoning soldiers, except sending them to the common gaols; and he did not think that an association with the ordinary inhabitants of gaols would be likely to send a soldier back to his regiment at all improved. It was a great mistake to suppose that corporal punishment did not prevail in foreign armies. Foreign soldiers were subject to blows and stripes, and the only difference between them and ours was, that in the one case this species of punishment was inflicted with trial, and in the other without trial. He apprehended that the House would not be inclined to follow this course. Many of the substitutes for this punishment in foreign countries would not be tolerated in England. If our soldiers were seen parading the streets with cannon-balls chained to their legs, such a spectacle would be much more revolting and disgusting to the public mind than the present system. The noble mover wished to abolish all corporal punishments, except for certain offences named in the clause. Now, the mutiny act and the articles of war said, "Go to the civil power whenever it is possible," and the cases in which this was not possible were the very cases in which the noble lord wished to do away with corporal punishment. The mutiny act was passed to provide for cases which called for the immediate interposition, and which the ordinary course of the law could not put down. These were, desertion, disobedience, insubordination, and mutiny, whatever it might be, and these the noble lord wished to exclude from corporal

punishment. But the noble lord's proposition involved an impossibility; and he thought that it would be better to say that there should be no punishment but death, and take away corporal punishment altogether, rather than make such dangerous exclusions as these.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00897"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> entered into a lengthened explanation of the clauses of the bill. He pointed out the inequality of the assessment of the Land-tax, as it existed at present in England, both as regarded the Catholic and Protestant land-owners. It had been formed, as it then stood, in the reign of William 3rd. and had continued down to near the end of the reign of George 3rd. in the same disproportion. Another grievance under which the Catholics especially laboured, was the necessity of being compelled to prove the payment of the four shillings in the pound upon a rack-rent, before any relief could be sought in the court of Exchequer; and every succeeding year the evil had increased. The object of the bill was, not to place the Catholics in a better situation than the Protestants, with respect to the Land-tax, nor to throw on Protestants, that portion of the burthen from which the Catholics were to be relieved.</membercontribution></p>

<title>STATE OF THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00901"><member>Mr. Sykes</member><membercontribution> said, it would be recollected, that he had, at the end of the last parliament, endeavoured to draw the attention of the House to the state of the unrepresented freeholders in certain counties corporate, and that he had brought in a bill which was read a first time, declaratory of what he conceived to be the law upon the subject. He found that there were many districts, separated from the counties to which they belonged, in which the freeholders had no right to vote at the elections of knights of the shire; and to remedy that anomaly in the law, he had introduced a bill which was opposed by an hon. and learned gentleman opposite, on two distinct and separate grounds. The first respected the right of the freeholders to vote at elections for their respective counties. It was urged that though he had come to the conclusion, that they had such right, he was not therefore entitled to call upon the House to come to the same conclusion without investigation. The second respected the particular time at which his bill was introduced. It was at that time, as he had said before, near the end of the parliament, and some counties were already engaged in severe election contests. It was said, that it would be unfair to pass a bill at such a time, inasmuch as it would alter the number of votes in all the contested counties throughout the kingdom. He had yielded to the weight of these two arguments, and had deferred his bill to a future period, determining, however, to bring it forward again on the earliest opportunity. During the interval which had elapsed since the dissolution of the last parliament, he had turned the matter over and over again in his mind; and he was now of opinion, that the best shape in. which he could bring it again under the notice of parliament would be, by moving for a committee to inquire into the state of the representation in these counties corporate. He thought that such a mode of proceeding would obviate the objection which had previously been made to his motion, on the ground that he was taking the House by surprise. His attention had been drawn to the subject by a knowledge of the situation in which many of the inhabitants of the town which he had the honour to represent, were placed. King-

ton-upon-Hull was a town and county of itself. It was separated from the county of York, to which it originally belonged, by a charter granted to it in the time of Henry 6th. It contained a great number of freeholders, some of whom were gentlemen of independent fortune, and others were extensively connected with the town and trade of the port of Hull. Now these persons had no right, in virtue of their freeholds, to vote at all; neither at Hull, at elections of burgesses for that town, nor at York at elections of knights of the shire for the county. What was true with respect to the freeholders of the town and county of Hull, was, he believed true, with respect to the freeholders of the corporate counties. The number of such counties was he believed nineteen. He would state their names from a list which he had drawn up. He had excluded London from it, because, from its great commercial importance, and from the: various privileges which it had received at: different periods of its history, it stood on very different grounds from any of the other corporate counties. It was, besides, a county by prescription, the origin of its separation from the county of Middlesex not having yet been discovered in any records. Bristol was made a county by a charter of Edward 3rd.; York was separated from the county which bore its name by a charter of Richard 2nd.; Lincoln, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and Norwich, by charter of Henry 4th.; Coventry, Kingston-upon-Hull, Nottingham, and Southampton, by charters of Henry 6th.; Canterbury and Haverfordwest by charters of Edward 4th.; Glocester by charter of Richard 3rd.; Chester by charter of Henry 7th.; Exeter by charter of Henry 8th., Lichfield by charter of Mary; Poole by charter of Elizabeth; and Carmarthen and Worcester by charters of James 1st. Now, of these places the freeholders of Bristol, Haverfordwest, Lichfield, Norwich, Nottingham, and Exeter, vote for the town and city members in conjunction with the burgesses and citizens; and the freeholders of Canterbury, Poole, Southampton, and ainsty of York, vote at the election of knights for the parent county. He had therefore no complaint to make with respect to the freeholders in those places, as his intention was not to give to any parties a double right, but only to secure to those who had it not, a single right of voting in virtue of their freeholds.
<col>1104</col>
&#x2014;He must now observe, that in the remaining nine of the nineteen corporate counties which he had mentioned, the freeholders were at present entirely unrepresented; and the question was, first, whether such a state of things ought in justice and expediency to be continued? and secondly, whether it existed as of right at present? On the first part of the question he would say but little, because he was convinced that even those who most strenuously advocated the propriety of things remaining as they now were, and who from principle were the most inimical to every species of reform, would admit that it was a gross injustice, that the freeholders of those places should not be put upon the same footing as the freeholders of the county of which those places topographically formed part. In the course of the inquiries which he had made, he had satisfied himself that the right yet remained in the freeholders of those corporate counties to vote at the elections of knights of the parent shire. He made that assertion upon authority of lord Coke; he made it also upon authority of cases adjudged in that House. He laid it down, upon those combined authorities, as undeniable law, that though the king, by his royal prerogative, might separate any city or town from the county to which it originally belonged, and so give them new franchises, it laid not within the royal prerogative to take away from the inhabitant freeholders of that city or town any franchises which they held previously. He repeated, on the authority of lord Coke, that such was the law. In the fourth Institute, p. 46, he used this language&#x2014;"If the king doth newly incorporate an ancient borough, which sent burgesses to the parliament, and granteth that certain selected burgesses shall make election of the burgesses of parliament, where all the burgesses elected before, this charter taketh not away the election of the other burgesses." Now, what was true with regard to the electors of a borough, must also be true with regard to the electors of a county. Lord Coke then proceeded to state the reason why it was true. "And so if a city hath power to make ordinances they cannot make an ordinance that a less number shall elect burgesses for the parliament than made the election before; for free elections of members of the high court of parliament are <i>pro bono publico</i>, and not to be compared to other cases of elections of mayors, bailiffs, &amp;c. of corpora-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0560"/>
<col>1105</col>
tions, &amp;c." Lord Coke then said, that if the king could not take away a franchise, neither could he exempt from a liability. Now, the exercise of the elective franchise was a liability to which every freeholder was exposed; it was a duty thrown on him by the constitution, from which, in case of emergency, the law itself would not allow him to shrink. On this point, the language of lord Coke was most explicit: &#x2014;"The king cannot grant a charter of exemption to any man to be freed from the election of knight, citizen, or burgesse of the parliament, (as he may do of some inferior office or places) because the election of them ought to be free, and his attendance is for the service of the whole realme, and for the benefit of the king and his people, and the whole commonwealth hath an interest therein."&#x2014;He therefore contended, on the best authority, that though the king might separate a city or town from the county by royal grant, he could not by that grant take away from the inhabitants any immunities which they had previously possessed. Besides lord Coke, there were other authorities still more binding. The law had been decided by an election committee of the House, in a case which was to be found in Glanville's Reports, p. 54. It appeared from the statement of that learned reporter, that in the time of James 1st. a question had arisen as to the right of election for the borough of Chippenham. In ancient times all the burgesses in that borough shared in the elective franchise; but queen Mary, who gave a charter to that borough, confined the possession of it to a select number. The legality of that limitation came to be argued before a committee of the House, and he would read one sentence which deserved their particular attention: it was as follows.&#x2014;"Secondly, it was conceived by the committee, and so reported to the House and there resolved, that the said charter of queen Mary, did not, nor could alter the form and right of election for burgesses to the parliament within the said borough from the course there before, time out of mind, held; so as if, before this said charter, all the burgesses and inhabitants called freemen, or any other larger number of qualified persons, had already used and ought of right to make the election, then the charter, although it may incorporate this town, which was not incorporate before, or may alter the name or form of the corporation
<col>1106</col>
there, in matters concerning only themselves and their own government, rights, and privileges, yet it cannot alter and abridge the general freedom and form of elections for burgesses to the parliament, wherein, as aforesaid, the commonwealth is interested." He would desire hon. members to draw, if they could, a distinction between the cases of these burgesses, and that of the unrepresented freeholders in separate corporate counties. If the grant of the Crown could not alter and abridge the general freedom and form of elections for burgesses to the parliament, <i>pari ratione</i> it could not limit the right of the freeholders to vote at elections for knights of the shire. Such was the result of his inquiry into this subject: he had himself taken considerable pains in investigating it; but he should be unjust to Mr. Uvedale Corbett, if he did not acknowledge that he had found, in his very excellent work on the elective franchise, nearly every thing which he wanted. He proposed, therefore, the appointment of a committee, to inquire into the state of the elective franchise in separate counties, with the view of relieving freeholders from the injuries which they sustained under the present circumstances. He trusted the House would not be alarmed at this inquiry, as being connected with the question of reform. This was not of a character to frighten even the most timorous opponent of reform. There was nothing sweeping or dangerous about it, as it only contemplated the removal of an admitted evil existing in particular places; and it had been always stated by those who were opposed to the general question of reform, that where a blot or blemish could be pointed out, they would assist in applying a particular remedy to the particular grievance. The hon. gentleman concluded by moving, "That a select committee be appointed to inquire into the state of the Elective Franchise, in the several districts and cities corporate within England and Wales."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00902"><member>Mr. F. Lewis</member><membercontribution> began by remarking, that the hon. gentleman had stated, that on the previous occasion when he had brought this question before parliament, he had withdrawn it at his (Mr. F. L.'s) suggestion. He now rose to offer another suggestion to the hon. gentleman, which was, that he should change the course he was following, and, instead of asking for a committee of inquiry, at once bring in a bill. In his
<image src="S2V0018P0I0561"/>
<col>1107</col>
opinion, the volume referred to by the hon. gentleman, and which was written by one of the council employed in the Coventry case, had completely exhausted the subject. He advised the hon. gentleman to bring in a bill, because, in that shape, the question could be discussed with far more advantage than it could be in a committee. An inquiry would introduce the consideration of the entire state of the representation; and neither the House nor the country should imagine, if they recognized the principle laid down by the hon. gentleman, that they could find any mode of shutting the door which that inquiry would open into all the reasons of state propriety, and convenience, on which the representation of this country was founded. He had quoted Mr. Pox before, and he would quote him again in reference to this question. Mr. Fox had said, that the rights of election in this country were like a house built at various times, which, though an odd piece of patchwork, which could not be explained on any system of architecture, was yet far better and more convenient than if devised as a whole on any regular plan. The condition of the freeholders in the towns and cities corporate was strictly consonant with other parts of the representative system. If the hon. gentleman took these peculiarities one by one, and examined charter by charter, he would probably learn the reason why each was as he would now find it. In the city of London, for example, no freeholder had the right of voting for the county of Middlesex, simply because the rights and privileges of the city of London, on account of its great importance, had been always such, that it had never formed an integral part of the county of Middlesex. In every case the circumstances varied. In the cities latest erected, the rights of the freeholders had been preserved. In the instance of York, the freeholder had no right to vote either for the city or the county; but in the ainsty, he retained his privilege for the county. In the case of the city of Carmarthen, the freeholders had no right to vote for the city as freeholders, but they were entitled if they chose to become freemen, and as such they voted for the city. In many instances the right of voting had been settled by a solemn decision of that House, and in some &#x2014;Coventry for example&#x2014;it had been determined by an act of Parliament. Why were these rights now to be subject to revi-
<col>1108</col>
sion more than any other part of the elective franchise of the country? He should, therefore, feel it his duty to oppose the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00903"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> said, the right hon. gentleman had entirely mistaken the object and views of his hon. friend. The committee proposed, were not to inquire into the expediency of setting up new rights, but only of restoring those which could be proved to have existed formerly, and which, under particular circumstances, had lapsed. The elective franchise of a freeholder was not a personal right, vested in the individual himself; it belonged to the freehold, and if that was sold, the right of voting was transferred with the property. In the town he had the honour of representing, there was a numerous body of freeholders who could vote neither for the town of Newcastle nor the county of Northumberland. In the time of Henry 4th, the town was separated into a county of itself. This was a privilege and distinction granted to it for the part it had taken in some commotions in the north, in which it had been particularly useful to the government. Originally, the town of Newcastle sent joint-representatives with the county of Northumberland. The first notice was in the 22nd of Edward 1st, when the representatives were styled the members for the united counties of Northumberland and Newcastle-on-Tyne. In three or four years the representation was divided, and Newcastle sent burgesses to parliament under its own charter, and the county sent its members also. The power given by the charter to elect representatives, included all free burgesses, whether by birth or servitude: but it did not, therefore, take away the right of voting from the freeholder. The right hon. gentleman had objected to the committee because he apprehended it would bring on a general inquiry into the whole state of the representation; but his hon. friend had stated that it would be confined to the particular question before the House, and was not to be extended to any general views of reform. If it was the opinion of the House, that his hon. friend should bring in a bill, he had no doubt he would agree to it, but the arguments of the right hon. gentleman as to that point, were singularly inconsistent; for while he had recommended a bill, he had proved the impossibility of entering into the discussion of every circumstance, unless in a committee. He there-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0562"/>
<col>1109</col>
fore thought, that the mode of bringing the question to a more certain decision, would be to adopt the proposition of his hon. friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00904"><member>Colonel Sibthorpe</member><membercontribution>, though an enemy to abstract reform, yet thought that, where a clear case of deprivation of undoubted right, which once existed, had been shown, the House was bound to give it their closest attention. His own opinion was, that in most of the cases of local jurisdiction, a barter was made between the burgesses and the Crown, by which the former were released from the expense of sending representatives to parliament. However, as this might not have been the case with all the places named by the hon. mover, it was but fair to go into an inquiry on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00905"><member>Lord Lowther</member><membercontribution> said, that in this discussion one very material point had been overlooked. The information he possessed had been obtained on the investigation of the Warwick case before the House. The objection taken to the admission of the freeholders of Coventry to the right of voting for the county, was, that they could not show that the city of Coventry had ever belonged to the county of Warwick; and that the freeholders of Coventry were, therefore, not subject to the usual duties which devolved on all freeholders of the county. They never served on juries; they were not liable to serve the office of sheriff; nor did they share the expenses of the county, nor pay towards the county rates. If they had lost the franchise on the one hand, they had gained many advantages by it on the other; and he believed, if the question were put to these freeholders in The different parts of the country, whether they would prefer to have the elective franchise restored to them with the ordinary duties that accompanied it, they would decline it. The customs were very different in every one of these instances; and he was convinced, that if the gift of the franchise were offered them, with the attendant responsibilities, they would consider it rather a burthen than a benefit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00906"><member>The Attorney-general</member><membercontribution> agreed entirely with his noble friend. The hon. mover proposed to examine each individual case on its own grounds; but this general proposition was founded on a fallacy. The freeholder whose property was situated in a city or town which was a county in itself, could not, in certain cases, vote for the city or town where he was not a freeman,
<col>1110</col>
nor for the county, because his estates did not form a part of it. His answer to the hon. mover was the same as that given by his right hon. friend and the noble lord. He had no doubt, that in every instance these cases had originated in some bargain or agreement made between the Crown and the parties, by which the town was taken out of the jurisdiction of the county, and had other immunities and privileges conferred upon it. In the case of Coventry, the freeholders in that city paid no county rates; they served no county offices; they had courts and sheriffs of their own, and other advantages. The charters of the Crown were not acts of violence, bereaving these freeholders of their rights, but compacts made with the town, by which they were carried out of the county, in order to enjoy advantages of their own. The measure proposed by his hon. friend would go to destroy that part of the charters; and if a bill were passed giving the freeholders votes, it would in effect put an end to the bargain made with the Crown. He had no doubt, that if the question were put to those freeholders, they would gladly remain without the elective franchise, rather than take it with the burthens belonging to it. In the instance of Coventry, the people had strongly resisted the introduction of the authority of the county magistrates. They preferred their own courts and magistrates, because they were more conversant with the matters that came before them. It would be impossible, if the right of voting was given to these freeholders, to draw the line of demarcation in regulating the rates and other demands that fell upon property. He apprehended that it would not be very palatable to the city of London, if, in order that the freeholders should obtain votes for the county of Middlesex, the city was obliged to give up some of to privileges. He admitted that there might be a number of persons living immediately adjoining to the very walls of a borough town, and yet deprived of the right of voting either for that borough or for the county; but he contended, that this anomaly proceeded from the inhabitants of the borough having entered into a compact with those who gave them their charter,&#x2014;a compact by which they sacrificed certain rights which they possessed, for the purpose of obtaining others which they then considered more advantageous to their interests. Conceiving, therefore, that this anomaly was capable of a full
<image src="S2V0018P0I0563"/>
<col>1111</col>
explanation upon that view of the case, and knowing that, if they attempted to reform one anomaly of that description they might proceed to reform another, and so on without end, he felt himself bound to object to the motion. He could not divest himself of the opinion, that when these boroughs received their charters, their inhabitants had a choice left to them of remaining freeholders of the county, or becoming members of the corporation; and as the system of their representation whether founded upon compact or choice, was of so ancient a date, and any attempt to produce changes was likely to produce inconvenience and confusion, he saw no good end to be answered by the proposed inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00907"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> denied that any such compact was ever entered into, as that upon which the Attorney-general founded his objections to the present motion. He knew that it was not so in Ireland; and he thought it could not be so in England. In the cities of Cork, Dublin, and Limerick, many persons, who could not give a vote for the members of the corporation, had yet the power to vote for the members of the county, and he believed that a similar practice prevailed in England. Where, then, was the compact to which the learned gentleman alluded, and upon which he had laid so much stress? Admitting, however, all that the learned gentleman had asserted upon the subject of these anomalies, he would say to the House, if there be an anomaly producing injury and injustice to a portion of the people, then it is your duty to remove it; rather than to say, like the learned gentleman, "I know this may be an anomaly, and that those persons are deprived of their rights, but we cannot cure the evil, lest it compel us to prosecute more extended inquiries into the state of the representation."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00908"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> confessed, that the line which, in some cases, separated the inhabitants of borough towns, and deprived them of the right of voting, was an anomaly in our representative system; but then, was not the whole of our system of representation an anomaly? He was disposed to take much the same view of the situation of these persons as his learned friend (the Attorney-general), and to consider that much of the evil had been produced by the lapse of time, and the change of circumstances. In many of the charters
<col>1112</col>
of these borough towns, it was expressly provided, that the power of the sheriff was not to extend beyond certain bounds for the purpose of levying any rates or charges, some of these charges being for the payment of wages to the members who served for the boroughs. In many instances, however, the very right of voting, itself, had been lost from non-usage. Much of this loss, too, had been created, or rather sanctioned by the decisions of parliament, during the first fifteen years after the accession of the House of Hanover. During that time, a variety of decisions were pronounced by the House upon election petitions, each decision overturning the foregoing, until it was scarcely known in whom the right of voting remained. This system, however, which might be characterized as one of the most profligate upon the record of parliamentary transactions was at length abolished by the act which made the last decision of the House in every case the final decision. This salutary act at once checked the system of meddling with the representation of a borough under the authority of the minister, and settled the nature of the representation. After some observations upon the difference between the right of a voter in a borough which depended upon peculiar circumstances and upon the payment of certain rates and charges, and the right of a voter for the county, which depended upon the soil, the right hon. gentleman went on to observe, that we must look at these things in the abstract, and draw our opinions of the representation, not from a few isolated circumstances or particular anomalies, but from its working as a whole. It ought not to be forgotten, as he had observed before, that the system was a succession of anomalies, and that these anomalies, in effect, constituted the strength, beauty, and fitness of the whole plan of representation. He believed that, if the united wisdom of man was concentred in the attempt to devise a form of representation, no system could be laid down which would produce such beneficial results to the country, or so completely answer all the objects of a representative government. He knew, when he said this, that there were many wise and able men who differed with him in opinion; but such was his firm conviction, and as long as he had a seat in that House, he would resist any attempt to remedy what were considered special or particular evils, at the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0564"/>
<col>1113</col>
risk of endangering the system itself. The members of that House might not all be returned by the voice of the inhabitants of the particular place from which they were sent; but there was scarcely any man not represented in some way or other; and it ought not to be forgotten, that every member, when once returned to that House, was not the representative of any particular place, or of the opinion of any set of men, but of the whole body of the people. If they were once to allow such an inquiry to commence, they could not stop, but must go on to such an extent that he did not know what city or borough could be called safe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00909"><member>Mr. Alderman Wood</member><membercontribution>, although a member for the city of London, returned by the livery, felt it due to justice to say, that there was a very large number of freeholders in the city&#x2014;men of great property &#x2014;who were unfairly excluded from the privilege of voting for a representative in parliament. It might be unpopular to say so, but he thought this a grievance of which those persons had good reason to complain. It was indeed a matter worthy of consideration, whether, if the franchise could not be conferred upon these persons there ought not to be a fifth representative of the city, in order that the freeholders might have the means of procuring an organ of their opinion. If the honourable member (Mr. Sykes) succeeded in procuring a committee to inquire into the state of corporate towns, he thought the subject might be submitted to its attention.</membercontribution></p>

not bettered by this. Would he give the freeholders of London a power of voting on behalf of their freehold for some distant county in which they had no land at all. The worthy alderman's proposition of a fifth member for London was, however, rather inconvenient; for it was open to great doubts whether the number of representatives of any place could be increased, without making a corresponding increase in the number of representatives for Scotland and Ireland. But if it were unjust that the freeholders of London should be excluded from the right of voting, why were individuals possessed of great personal property excluded from that privilege in counties? There was, in truth, no injustice in excluding freeholders from voting in cities, as the right to vote had never attached to the freehold. Much had been said of the anomalies of their representative system; but it was to those anomalies that it owed its superiority over that of France and other countries. There was not an individual in the land who might not render himself capable of enjoying the elective franchise, and the poorest man could acquire that right by servitude. So far, then, from those anomalies being blots upon the system, he considered them as productive of great advantage. There were a great number of cases at present, where freeholders resident within the limits of corporate jurisdiction possessed the right of voting for members of counties. In London and Middlesex the freeholders possessed no such right; but it was enjoyed by freeholders resident in Canterbury, Poole, and Southampton. In Bristol, Haverford-west, Norwich, and Exeter, the resident freeholders could vote at the election of the knights burgesses. In one part of the city of York, the freeholders could neither vote for the members for the county nor the city, and in another district they possessed the right of voting at the election of the county members. He believed there were nineteen or twenty places, where the freeholders could neither vote for the city nor for the county members. It appeared to him, therefore, under all the circumstances, that the best way to determine the right of the freeholders would be, to bring in a bill affirming the right in any particular place, and then it would be in the power of the House, by a much more limited inquiry, to ascertain upon what
<image src="S2V0018P0I0565"/>
<col>1115</col>
that right was founded. In a question so complicated as that of the right of voting, vested in the inhabitants of chartered towns, differing so much as they did from each other in the nature of exercising that right, he thought it would be better to bring in local bills applying to each particular case; and then the House would have a fair opportunity of deciding upon the merits of each separate case, and of ascertaining whether the inhabitants were subjected to any and what burthens from their peculiar situation. For these reasons, he thought it would be better to withdraw the present proposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00913"><member>Mr. Sykes</member><membercontribution>, in reply, observed, that his motion had been quite misunderstood. The object of it was not to confer a right, but to declare one which at present existed. The learned Attorney-general had maintained, without adducing a single proof in support of the assertion, that when the charters were granted by the Crown, a compact was entered into, by which the freeholders forfeited their right to vote. Now, he would contend that it was not competent for the Crown to enter into a compact to deprive any party of a legal right. In point of fact, the right never could be taken away; it was in existence to the present moment, and his motion was merely declaratory of its existence. Seeing, however, that the sense of the House was rather against the motion, he begged leave to withdraw it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00914">The motion was accordingly withdrawn; and Mr. Sykes gave notice, that on Thursday se'nnight he would introduce a bill affirming the right of voting to the freeholders of Hull.</p>

<title>CRIMINAL TRIALS IN SCOTLAND&#x2014;<lb/> JUSTICIARY COURT.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00915"><member>The Lord-Advocate</member><membercontribution>, in rising to move for leave to bring in a bill to "authorize an additional Circuit Court of Justiciary to be held at Glasgow, and to facilitate Criminal Trials in Scotland," said, he did not anticipate any opposition to the motion. A great deal had been said of the progress of crime in this country, but he was sorry to say that crime in Scotland had kept pace with that increase. A return had been made of the number of criminal commitments in each year, so far back as the year 1805. In that year, the number of criminal commitments for all Scotland amounted only to eighty-five: in 1809 it had risen to between two hundred and three hundred;
<col>1116</col>
in 1819&#x2013;20, it had increased to four hundred; and by the last return it appeared, that in 1827 six hundred and sixty-one persons had been committed for trial. He was inclined to think that the great increase of crime, particularly in the west of Scotland, was attributable, in no small degree, to the number of Irish who daily and weekly arrived there. He did not mean to say that the Irish were themselves in the habit of committing more crimes than their neighbours; but he was of opinion that their numbers tended to reduce the price of labour, and that an increase of crime was the consequence. Another cause was, the great disregard manifested by parents for the moral education of their children. Formerly the people of Scotland were remarkable for the paternal care which they took of their offspring. That had ceased, in many instances, to be the case. Not only were parents found who did not pay attention to the welfare of their children, but who were actually parties to their criminal pursuits, and participators in the fruits of their unlawful proceedings. In order to produce a more speedy administration of justice in the western parts of Scotland, and in those places which, containing a greater proportion of inhabitants, were of course more fertile in the production of crime, it was necessary to take some measures for holding additional sessions. In Scotland, the sessions or assize, were not held as in England, in counties, but in districts comprehending several counties. For instance, the district in which offences committed in Glasgow were brought to trial, comprehended Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, and Dumbartonshire, including in them the town of Paisley, and Glasgow, a place in which there were one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants. By the returns it appeared that in 1813 the criminals committed for trial at these sessions in Glasgow were only thirty. In 1817, they amounted to eighty-three. In 1823, they were one hundred and eighty-five; and, in 1827, two hundred and eleven. The consequence of this lamentable increase was, that the judges were unable to get through the list. In addition to this protraction of the labours of the session, it was to be considered, that many individuals who were committed for trial, and afterwards declared not guilty, suffered an imprisonment of nearly six months before they were brought to trial. Under these circumstances, some remedy
<image src="S2V0018P0I0566"/>
<col>1117</col>
was necessary; and he therefore proposed to give the Glasgow district an additional circuit after Christmas, at the time when I the court of session was not sitting. He also wished the district of Forfar and Fife to have the same remedy; and, as it was to be hoped that the necessity for this increase of the number of circuits would not continue, he proposed that his majesty, while he had the power to order these circuits, should be empowered at the same time to discontinue them, when they were found to be no longer requisite. The learned lord then enumerated several alterations in the practice of the criminal courts of Scotland, which he wished to abolish. Among them was the practice of legal citations, which he considered highly absurd; while he preserved to the criminal the fifteen days' notice of his trial. The delivery of verdicts in writing also led to inconveniences, and he wished the verdicts in every case to be given, as in England, verbally. The confession of guilt he also desired to have recorded as in this country, without having recourse to an appeal to the jury, as in Scotland, which was both unnecessary and expensive. The learned lord then moved for leave to bring in a bill "to authorise an additional circuit of justiciary to be held at Glasgow and to facilitate criminal trials in Scotland."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00916"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, he had heard with great pain the statement made by the learned lord as to the increase of crime in Scotland. He did not think that he had, however, fairly explained the reason of that increase. In his Opinion, a great number of those commitments arose from the difficulties which individuals encountered in obtaining the necessaries of life; and he hoped the time would soon come when things would grow better, and when, in consequence, the growth of crime would be checked. This could only be effected by a general improvement of the situation of the people, and not by the adoption of temporary palliatives. He could not see why the practice of the city of London, with respect to the holding of frequent sessions, should not be followed throughout the country. One great cause of crime was the leaving individuals so long in prison, as their morals suffered by the example of those with whom they were obliged to associate. It would be much better, if, as was the case in the city of London, a session was held every six or eight weeks, at Glasgow and elsewhere.
<col>1118</col>
It might be contended, that the judges could not get through the business if this plan were adopted. He, however, saw no force in that objection; for there was no want of judges in Scotland, to divide the labour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00917"><member>Mr. Benett</member><membercontribution> was of opinion that the increase of crime was not produced by an actual growth of vice and immorality amongst the people, but was occasioned by the hardness of the times which reduced the lower orders to the commission of practices of which they would not otherwise be guilty. The remedy proposed by the learned lord was to extend the number of the circuits, and thus to cause justice to be done more promptly. That certainly was desirable; but while he admitted that, he must be allowed to observe, that it would be better to seek out the cause of crime and to check it, than to direct their attention merely to the punishment of offences.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00918"><member>Mr. Kennedy</member><membercontribution> thought it highly desirable that, measures should be adopted for bringing individuals accused of offences to as immediate a trial as possible. One great evil was the state of the gaols in Scotland. In the condition of those gaols he believed the increase of crime in a great measure to have originated. Nothing could be worse. A person shut up in one of those gaols for four or five months before trial must necessarily suffer such contamination that the punishment that might afterwards be inflicted on him could not be attended with any moral effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00919"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> hoped that the learned lord would take into consideration the disadvantage under which those English counties, which were near the Scotch borders laboured, in consequence of the system of banishment out of Scotland, which formed one of the punishments awarded by the Scottish law. Thus an unfortunate Scotchman, if banished from his native country for his misdeeds, immediately sheltered himself in Northumberland, and was by no means sorry to give tip his peat fire for a comfortable chimney corner in a neighbouring town. For his own part, he could not conceive how this banishment could be considered as a penalty. On this point he could not but quote the opinion of the poet, by whom it had been wittily said,
<quote>"Had Cain been Scot, God had revers'd his doom,
Not forced to wander, but remain'd at home."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00920"><member>Mr. H. Drummond</member><membercontribution> was sorry that there
<image src="S2V0018P0I0567"/>
<col>1119</col>
was such an increase of crime in Scotland. Distress was one great cause of crime in that country, but it was not the only cause; for, from his own observation, he could assert that many persons committed offeencs who were not in want. With respect to what the learned lord had said about the Irish, he agreed with him, that they did not commit more crimes than their neighbours; but unquestionably, by increasing the population, they increased the general distress, and thus contributed to the growth of crime. As to what the hon. baronet had said about the deterioration of the morals of the people of Northumberland in consequence of persons being banished from Scotland, he need not be under any alarm on that account; seeing that, though such a punishment did exist in the law of Scotland it was hardly ever resorted to&#x2014;perhaps not once in five or six years. With respect to what the hon. member for Montrose had said relative to the Scotch judges, he was entirely at variance with him. In this instance, they had only to do with the criminal judges. Now there were twelve judges in England, and instead of there being a greater number in Scotland, there were only six. As to having eight sessions in the year, it was a most extravagant idea; for no one would think of sending judges, counsel, and jurors, round the country to places where, perhaps there were only one or two prisoners to be tried.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EDUCATION IN IRELAND.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00922"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> rose to make the motion of which he had given notice. He hoped that, if any discussion arose upon it, all asperity would be avoided and no topic touched upon that was likely to create angry feeling. Let them argue the principles of the question temperately, and strive to produce the happy result of agreeing upon some plan for the education of Ireland. All that he intended to do was, to make out a case which would warrant the appointment of a committee. For this purpose he would merely refer to the proceedings which had already taken place, and to the state in which the subject now stood. In the year 1806, education in Ireland was for the first time since the Union brought under the consideration of parliament. In that year a commission was appointed under the government of the duke of Bedford. The commissioners had presented fourteen reports between the
<col>1120</col>
years 1806 and 1813, and had cost the country from 17,000<i>l.</i> to 20,000<i>l.</i> Another commission had presented nine reports, and had cost the country 40,000<i>l.</i> He merely mentioned these facts, as illustrative of what commissions for the most part were. There was nothing more common in parliamentary tactics, than to get rid of a troublesome question by moving for a commission. He thought this plan objectionable, and seldom productive of any other result than the getting rid of the question. As for the committee for which he was about to move, he did not wish that it should be invested with any extensive powers. He did not think it necessary that they should send for witnesses. All he wished was, that preceding inquiries might be referred to the committee, in order that they might see if any good scheme of education could be extracted from them. He believed that if a few gentlemen of sincere intentions would execute this task without attending to either of the contending parties, without looking to the right hand or to the left, but acting merely as arbiters and judges between the two, the result of their labours would be extremely beneficial. Let them consider the question as a new one. He hoped it would not be thought that he wished to add to the burthens of the country. He was as strongly convinced that economy was necessary, as that the duty was imperative; and he was certain that much less money than had already been wasted upon the subject, would have effected the establishment of an efficient system of national education. There was one establishment in Ireland which he rejoiced to find that no one defended. The establishment he referred to was that of charter schools in Ireland, and yet they had cost the country one million pounds sterling. Now if that sum had been bestowed upon good, instead of mischievous, purposes, it would have accomplished the whole matter. He was quite sure, that to make any plan of education beneficial to Ireland, it must be, in part, supplied by local contributions&#x2014;either in the way of tax or contribution&#x2014;because then the inhabitants themselves would be the sureties to the public that the money was properly bestowed. He would now add a word or two upon the constitution of this committee. He wished it to consist merely of twenty one members, and to be as much as possible of an impartial nature. He
<image src="S2V0018P0I0568"/>
<col>1121</col>
thought much good might be done by the inquiry he proposed. He did not propose to attack any one institution, or to do any act that might give a triumph to either party. He wished only to select a number of gentlemen who should inquire how a great moral duty could be best performed, and how the public money could be most beneficially applied in the performance of that duty. He concluded by moving, "that the Reports on the subject of Education in Ireland be referred to a Select Committee of twenty-one members, with power to Report their Observations and Opinions thereon to the House."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00923"><member>Mr. W. Lamb</member><membercontribution> said, that perfectly concurring with his hon. friend in the advantages that would attend the diffusion of education in Ireland, he nevertheless wished his hon. friend had postponed his proposition to a more favourable opportunity. At present he confessed he was unable to see how it could be advantageously carried into effect. Still he could not refuse the means of eliciting all the information that could be obtained upon the subject. He confessed, however, that he was much less sanguine in his expectations of a beneficial result than was his hon. friend; and, standing in the situation in which he stood, he must be distinctly understood as declining to pledge himself to carry into effect any recommendation of the committee; although he should be most happy to do so, as far as was compatible with an abstinence from incurring any additional public expense, and with the principle of not extinguishing private benevolence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00924"><member>Mr. Brownlow</member><membercontribution> was glad that the motion was not to be opposed, as they were now totally without any efficient plan of national education in Ireland. All the schools were under the superintendence of the established church, and were therefore not places of resort to the Catholic. The charter schools of Ireland were certainly looked upon with great jealousy; and, as every society which had education for its object taught the doctrines of the church of England, or actually professed their wish to make converts from the errors of popery, there could be no common feeling between them and the Catholics. Out of the Protestants in Ireland one third were educated at the public expense: of the Catholics not one fourteenth. This made it necessary, that if education in Ireland was to be national, some active steps
<col>1122</col>
ought to be taken immediately. The subject had remained in this state ever since 1806, and when commissioners were appointed in 1824, to seek out some neutral ground on which the belligerent parties (for so he must call them) might meet and be educated, notwithstanding the difference between their religions, the commissioners declared that they had failed in their endeavours to discover such ground. He thought therefore that he might say, that though his hon. friend might devise a plan of national education which would meet with the approval of the House of Commons, yet, considering the state of parties in Ireland, he doubted if he could devise a plan that would be acceptable to all parties, and obtain the concurrence of the heads of those parties, without which his hon. friend could not stir one step. One of the plans proposed, was to take the Catholics and the Protestants together, and, choosing the propitious season of youth, before prejudice had yet been imbibed, to endeavour to inculcate a reciprocity of good feeling. They were thus to be educated together. The plans laid down for elementary education gave rise to no difference of opinion. They were to be taught writing, the first rules of arithmetic, and so forth. These contained no combustible matter. But then came religion, with which his majesty's commissioners said they would not meddle; and he thought they were right. Their religious education was to be left to their respective pastors. But the commissioners wished to select those parts of the gospels which involved no doctrinal points, and on which both Catholic and Protestant were agreed. In this they failed. It was objected, that the whole were taken from the authorized version of the scriptures of the one church. The hon. member here stated several other differences of a similar nature, in which the objections were not to points of doctrine, but which were nevertheless fatal to beneficial proposals. All these things made him think that they would not succeed in devising a good plan of national education in which all parties would concur. For his own part, he would leave the plan of elementary education as it stood, and not interfere with religion at all. He knew that this declaration would be taken as undervaluing religious education; but he begged leave to say, that he thought no education which was not a religious education worth any
<image src="S2V0018P0I0569"/>
<col>1123</col>
thing. He thought that all knowledge was valueless, when compared with the sacred knowledge which was to be found in the Bible. The Bible was good for time, as well as for eternity. For, if a man wished to make a fortune and keep it, what could be more calculated for both those purposes than Christian prudence and Christian honesty? If a man wished to raise himself to places of honour and of trust, what could be a better recommendation than Christian integrity? Whatever wise and proper end men might have in view in this life, he would ask the House to match him, if they could, any better rule of conduct than was contained in that matchless sentence&#x2014;"Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00925"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> thought it better not to enter at present into an examination of subjects which they would have to decide upon after the committee had made their report. Whatever might be the result of the labours of the committee, he was quite sure that much mischief might be done by a previous discussion of the topics which were to engage the attention of that committee. Several reports had been presented to the House, in consequence of a commission which he had had the honour to propose, and he could have wished that the recommendations contained in the last of those reports had been acted upon. As all the reports, however, were to be referred to this committee, whose business it would be, carefully to examine and compare them, he was not without hope that much good might result from their labours.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00926"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that as his right hon. friend had signified his intention of acquiescing in the proposition, he thought there could be but one opinion as to the propriety of abstaining from all discussion which might have a tendency to provoke the irritable feeling which already existed in Ireland upon this subject, and which, if awakened, was calculated to defeat the great object which all parties had in view. To him the best ground for preferring a parliamentary committee to a commission was, that 40,000<i>l.</i> had already been laid out upon commissions, not one of which had yet suggested any practicable plan to the consideration of the House. At the same time, while he deprecated an extended discussion, it seemed to him most fit that, the legislature should declare the principles on which it was disposed to
<col>1124</col>
extend the public grant: the first of these was, that the fund should be applied strictly without reference to party; and the second, that it should be distributed, not for independent purposes or efforts, but in aid of local and private subscription. The inevitable result of an avowal that government was ready to find money for any charitable purpose, unless some restrictions were laid upon the issue of that money, was to paralyze all private exertion; and, independently of the mere pecuniary question, the vigilance which was used over their own funds, by the subscribers to a local charity, was the best security that the public grant in aid of f that charity would be well applied. The attention which the resident gentry of Ireland would bestow upon institutions, established, and partly paid for, by themselves, would do more for the interests of those charities than could be expected from the most vigorous system of public inspection: and as to those proprietors who were not resident, he thought there could be little question that they would be found first in the list of pecuniary contributors. In conclusion, he agreed, that it would be advisable for the committee, in the first instance, to apply their attention to the reports of the preceding commissions, in preference to examining oral evidence: but as it was possible that, in the course of their labours, they might find the examination of witnesses desirable, he hoped the House would either at once grant that power in the appointment of the committee, or not refuse it, if, when the necessity arose, it should be hereafter applied for.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00927"><member>Mr. S. Rice</member><membercontribution> said, he should be ready to give the committee the power of examining witnesses, if, at a future time, that course should be found necessary; but he was anxious, in the first instance, to confine their attention to the reports of the commissions, in order, if possible, to avoid a mass of fresh evidence, which the desire to affirm contending opinions might multiply without end.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SAVINGS BANKS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00929"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that on a recent occasion he had moved for returns of the accounts of Savings Banks, from the period of their establish-

<col>1125</col>
ment to the present year. He now intended to resume the subject for the purpose of submitting certain motions, in continuation of those he had already brought forward. The money of the depositors in these banks was vested with government, who paid interest at the rate of 4<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per cent. In this manner government had, in ten years, received 2,835,774<i>l.</i>, and paid 3,323, 401<i>l.</i>; so that the public had lost by this arrangement no less than 487,627<i>l.</i> The loss which government was sustaining by those banks might be estimated at 1,000<i>l.</i> weekly. He was sorry that he had not, three years ago, moved for the appointment of a committee on this subject, or aimed at a repeal of the Savings' Bank bill. He was at that time, however, informed by the chancellor of the Exchequer, that a remedy for the evil was in contemplation. Was this loss to be suffered in the present financial condition of the country? The object for which those establishments were formed had been widely departed from. The bill should be repealed for two reasons; the progressive loss to the country, and the great surplus which the managers always had in possession untouched. This surplus in the Newcastle Savings' Bank, was at present 48,000<i>l.</i> The Devon and Exeter Bank was another example of the system on which those concerns were now managed. He thought no time should be lost in abating an evil so prejudicial to the state. For deposits amounting to 15,000,000<i>l.</i>, government had, within eleven years, paid the full price at which the money was invested by those who deposited it. On a change of the price of stock, government might lose three or four millions, while the depositors would be entitled to the same sum in any event. Now, he considered that they ought to be placed in precisely the, same situation as other capitalists who had money to invest. There was another point, which he hoped would be taken into consideration by the hon. member for Surrey; he meant the mismanagement of the officers intrusted with the business of the banks. The hon. member then moved for a return of the amount of interest paid by the commissioners for the reduction of the National Debt, and placed to the credit of the respective Saving Banks, from the period of their first establishment up to the 20th of November, 1827. He likewise moved for similar returns connected with those banks.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH VAGRANTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00932"><member>Lord Stanley</member><membercontribution> rose to move for a select committee to take into consideration the state of the laws relating to the passing of Irish Vagrants to their own country. The subject was one of great importance to the county of Lancaster, which was at considerable expense in passing Irish vagrants; and he thought the House would agree that it was hard that one county should be put to extraordinary expense, and feel the pressure almost exclusively, in consequence of its local situation. It would appear from the returns, that the numbers passed yearly were very considerable. In 1818, the numbers passed were 6,614; in 1819, 6,138. In 1823, there was an apparent reduction on the face of the returns; but it was only apparent, or if real was owing to temporary causes, as would appear from the subsequent increase. In 1823, the numbers were 1,337; in 1824, 3,043; in 1825, 3,358; and between June 1826, and July 1827, the numbers were 7,988. In fact, the evil had amounted to such a height, that something ought to be done to relieve the county of Lancaster from the burthen imposed upon it from this cause. His intention was, to move for a select committee, to inquire into the subject; and he thought the sooner they met the better, in order that they might decide what sort of returns they would require from the different counties, to enable them to enter into the merits of the case. His lordship concluded, by moving for the appointment of the said committee; which was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00933"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> rose to call the attention of the House to the novel, injudicious, and ruinous mode of proceeding at present adopted with regard to Promotions in the Army. The House was aware that up to the 2nd
<image src="S2V0018P0I0571"/>
<col>1127</col>
of May, 1825, officers were not permitted to sell their half-pay; but at that period a change had taken place, by which they were enabled to do so; and, in 1826, he had called for a return of the officers who had availed themselves of the permission to sell. But, in addition to the order to which he had already alluded, the commander-in-chief had issued another, on the 25th of April 1826, allowing officers to sell their half-pay commissions to officers of an inferior rank on the full-pay. On moving for a return of the officers who had availed themselves of this privilege, he had obtained documents which would show the great loss sustained by the country under the new arrangement. The hon. member here entered into a variety of calculations with a view to show the loss sustained to the country by the sale of commissions of old officers to young men. By this course of proceeding, annuities, amounting in the aggregate to near ten millions were outstanding. By the first return, it appeared that a sum of 656,785<i>l.</i> was lost in consequence of one year's sale of commissions. He should cite the cases of lieut.-colon el Cunyngham, John earl of Lisburn, and a variety of other officers, who, after having served a few years, had been placed on half-pay, after which they had been some twenty, some thirty, and some even forty years on half-pay, and had then sold out to young men who had been but a short time in the service. There were other cases in which lieutenants and ensigns had sold out to young men who had never seen a single day's service. He had made a similar statement on a former occasion, but then the House appeared satisfied with the answers given by the noble Secretary at War. They would, however, now perceive how far they had a right to be satisfied with those answers.&#x2014;He next came to the second return, from which it appeared, that an increase of expenditure had been incurred to the country to the amount of 1,513,000<i>l.</i> by the new system. It was no wonder that large establishments should be kept up in the office of the commander-in-chief and the office of the Secretary at War, when such an extensive correspondence was carried on with both those departments. The House would bear in mind, that from the two returns to which he had alluded, seven hundred and sixty-five officers had been allowed to sell out; and looking to the calculation he
<col>1128</col>
had made, it would be found that not less than 72,636<i>l.</i> had gone into the hands of the Bank of England. He thought, that when the king could not raise 100<i>l.</i> without coming to that House, it was too much that private individuals should have it in their power to tax the country in this way, and add, at least, a million and a half to its expenditure. If this system were to go on&#x2014;if every officer was thus to do as he pleased&#x2014;he thought the noble lord opposite would have much to answer for. It was very possible, however, that the noble lord would satisfy the House by making a counter statement, a sort of set off, as he had done before. But the House should bear in mind, that those who sold out were on the old pay, while those who came in, came in upon the new. He thought the House should appoint a special committee to inquire into these abuses. He gave the case to the House as he found it; and he must say, that it would be impossible to expect any reduction of this portion of our burthens, if young men were to take the place of old ones in this way. He would venture to say, that if an inquiry was made into the French half-pay, the whole amount paid in that way would be found to be a mere pittance, compared to what was paid in England. The French half-pay list had been diminishing since the peace; while we had been obviously adding to ours. He had asked, upon a former occasion, what decrease might be expected to take place in the half-pay? and he had been told a decrease of about five per cent on the average. But although the noble lord had taken credit for relieving the country to that extent, the fact was as he had stated it. The House ought not only to call for the continuance of those returns, but to appoint a special inquiry, when he was sure they would agree, that the effect of the present system was, to promote young men, but not to provide for those who had grown grey in the service, as they were originally taught to expect. Such, he would contend for it, was the result of the system upon the service [hear, hear&#x0021;]. He had consulted many officers on the subject, who agreed with him in that opinion. At all events, he had done his duty in bringing the subject before the House. The hon. member concluded by moving for a variety of returns relative to the sale of half-pay by officers in the army.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00934"><member>Sir James Graham</member><membercontribution> said, the speed of his hon. friend had disclosed to the House a source of profligate expenditure and of corrupt influence, which required to be checked without delay. His object in rising, was merely to ask the noble lord opposite to give a negative, as he hoped the noble lord could, to questions which he was going to ask him relative to two particular circumstances. He had been given to understand, that a certain officer in the army, who had been employed in the civil service of the country for the last fifteen years, and so employed that he was not allowed, by the rules of the military service, to receive his half-pay, had been allowed, after a lapse of fifteen years, in which he never received a farthing in virtue of his military commissions, to dispose of his half-pay. By that arrangement, a charge, which had had no existence for the last fifteen years, had been thrown upon the public. Now, did, he wished to know, this gentleman still continue in his civil employment? The other question which he had to ask related to a similar transaction in Ireland, where a military officer who had been in the civil service for the last eight years, and whose half-pay had consequently been suspended during that time, had also been allowed to sell his half-pay? He was sure it would be most satisfactory to the House, if he should prove to have been misinformed; but unless the rumours he had alluded to could be positively contradicted, he trusted that some member would move for a committee of inquiry, with a view specifically to inquire into the state of the half-pay, and to ascertain the extent of these disorders in the army.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00935"><member>Lord Palmerston</member><membercontribution> said, he had no objection to grant the returns called for. He could not, however, but express his surprise that the hon. member for Montrose should seize the present opportunity for going into such details and calculations; for he should have thought that matters of that sort, connected as they were with the army estimates, would have been referred to that committee of finance of which the hon. gentleman was himself a member. He would leave it to the gentlemen who formed that committee, to deal as they thought proper with the opinion which the hon. member had expressed of them, if not in words, at least by inference&#x2014;an opinion which went the length of telling the country, that they were not
<col>1130</col>
likely persons to inquire with advantage into such transactions. Whether the hon. member thought that it would answer his object better to make an inflamed statement to the House, before he referred his papers to a committee, he could not pretend to say; but he thought he might say, that the Finance Committee had sent for papers connected with it, in order to come to a satisfactory conclusion upon it. What led the hon. member to be so impatient to make his statement to the House before he had ascertained the correctness of the facts on which he rested it, the hon. member could best explain. This, however, he would say, that it was impossible that any statement should produce a more erroneous impression than that which the hon. member had made. Every one who heard the speech of the hon. member would suppose that by a certain arrangement the public had incurred a loss of 2,000,000<i>l.</i>; but whether the hon. member meant that it had incurred a loss of 2,000,000<i>l.</i> capital, or of 2,000,000<i>l.</i> a-year, he defied any person who heard him to understand. The nature of the arrangement was shortly this:&#x2014;At the conclusion of the war a reduction of the army necessarily took place; a great many officers were placed on half-pay, and their situations in the army, which became vacant on the full-pay, were regularly filled up by officers from the half-pay. That system went on progressively till the year 1827. It was then found that it had the effect of stopping promotion in regiments, and of continuing officers in situations for which their increasing age rendered them more unfit. The army had become as it were stagnant, and it was found necessary that some additional scope should be given to promotion. The arrangement proposed for that purpose was this:&#x2014;certain officers of certain rank were allowed for a certain period to sell their half-pay commissions to officers of an inferior rank on the full-pay who might be inclined to purchase them. The consequence of it was, to remove old officers from their regiments, and to give a scope to preferment amongst the younger officers, who remained behind. As young captains on full-pay, in many instances, bought the commissions of old majors on half-pay, the charge on the half-pay list he admitted increased. The loss to the public was incurred in this manner:&#x2014;a major who might live fifteen years, was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0573"/>
<col>1131</col>
was succeeded by another major who might live twenty-five years, and thus the public was saddled with an annuity which was likely to continue for a long time. The period had not, however, yet arrived in which the hon. member could affirm that any loss had been hitherto sustained by the public; for as yet the public had only to pay the same half pay as before; and it would not be till the expiration of the ten years that the public would have to pay the annuity exclusively to the younger life. He admitted that if there were no other check besides those which he had already mentioned on this arrangement, the public would be pledged to the payment of these annuities beyond the time to which they were originally designed to extend. But the arrangement did not stop here. Who were the persons who purchased these annuities? Those officers who were well provided with money. Was it to be supposed that an officer of fortune would buy a commission which would place him on a half-pay, if he had no other chance than that of being shelfed by such a proceeding? No; the object for which men of fortune invested their capital in these annuities was to obtain promotion. Let the House look, not merely to the probability, but to what was the fact on this subject. A major who had a half-pay commission, sold it to a captain on full-pay; the captain then became a major on half-pay, and wishing for employment looked out immediately for a full-pay major, with whom he might effectuate an exchange: so that by an intermediate change it often happened, that one old major on the half-pay list was succeeded at one remove by another major equally advanced in years. He would therefore recommend to the hon. member to make his motion embrace a return of those officers who had bought half-pay, and had afterwards exchanged into full-pay&#x2014; He would now ask the House to consider what was the result of this arrangement, even upon the showing of the hon. member himself. The sellers obtained the old price for their commissions, and the purchasers paid the new: and it appeared that in that manner the public had already received a sum of 72,000<i>l.</i> Against this gain on the part of the public was to be set the loss which it had incurred by having to pay a certain number of annuities which would commence ten years hence, and would last ten years after they
<col>1132</col>
had commenced. Now, what annuity to begin at the end of ten years, and to last for ten years afterwards, could you purchase for 72,000<i>l.</i> He should suppose a large annuity indeed. Therefore, if that second exchange, of which he had just spoken, had not taken place, the calculation on the amount of the number of pounds lost to the public would not rest entirely upon the probable duration of the lives of those who purchased the half-pay being greater than that of those who sold it. If, however, the House would take into consideration the effects of the second exchange, it would see, that in all probability no pecuniary loss would be suffered by the public.&#x2014;But leaving the question of loss to the public out of consideration, he would now ask what effect this arrangement had produced upon the army? It had given it an active establishment; it had provided it with efficient officers; it had given it a character for activity and efficiency, which was of the utmost advantage to the public service. It was on that ground that he had originally proposed the arrangement to parliament. It was not propounded by him as a measure of pecuniary advantage, but as a measure which was likely to conduce, and which he would say had conduced to the efficiency of the service. He would here observe, that the hon. member had pushed his argument so far in one direction that night, that he did not perceive how far he had strengthened the arguments which it had been his (lord P.'s) duty to address to the hon. member's understanding upon former occasions. The hon. member had frequently reproached those who had the disposal of the patronage of the army, with not having filled up the vacancies which occurred on the full-pay with officers taken from the half-pay. On those occasions he had as frequently said, that though there were many officers on the half-pay who would be willing enough to serve, the House deceived itself if it supposed that those officers were therefore fit and competent for service. He had said, that there were not only colonels and majors, but lieutenants and ensigns, who, from their length of service could not be again brought with any useful effect into active service. The statements which he had then made were received by the hon. member with a degree of incredulity which it would have been difficult to account for in any other member. Now, what turned out to be the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0574"/>
<col>1133</col>
fact, even on the hon. member's own showing? That the hon. member, when he reads through the half-pay list, finds that there are not only colonels and majors, but even lieutenants and ensigns, who have been on the half-pay for thirty or forty years. Ought such men as those to be put upon full-pay, and to be called into active service? He repeated, with considerable pride and satisfaction, that the hon. member had furnished him with the most favourable corroboration to the arguments which he had formerly used, in answer to the censures which the hon. member was so fond of flinging upon those who were intrusted with the patronage of the army. The hon. member then asked, "Is it not unjust to allow persons who had been so long on the half-pay list to sell their commissions at all?" To this he answered, that so long as those persons lived, they must remain a burthen on the public. Was it not, therefore, an advantage to enable them to retire and to supply their places with officers who could be called into active service without danger? He would not pretend to follow the hon. member through all the cases which he had that night mentioned to the House. The question ought to be decided upon principle and upon principle alone. If the principle were wrong, it would not be made worse by mixing it up with individual cases; and if right he would take his stand upon it at once. An hon. baronet had asked him whether there were not two cases in which military officers, who had been long employed in the civil service, had been allowed to sell their half-pay. He would reply, that of the case in Ireland, he knew nothing; there was, however, a case in which the circumstances of which the hon. baronet complained had taken place in England. And here he would observe, that he objected generally to allowing half-pay to be sold by any person who held a civil office: but there was one case in which the party on entering upon his civil employment had received an assurance from the head of the department, that he should be allowed to dispose of his half-pay. That assurance was given under the erroneous impression, that commissions of that sort might be sold according to the ordinary rules of the service. That party subsequently satisfied the Treasury that he had incurred, in consequence of that assurance, certain expenses which he would not otherwise have incurred. It
<col>1134</col>
was upon that ground alone, that he had been permitted to sell his half-pay. It was an exception, which stood upon its own grounds, and which did not at all affect the general principle. He was not prepared to say that there were not one or two cases in which a sale of half-pay might not have taken place before he had learnt that the party held a civil employment; for the House must be aware that he had no means of learning how every military officer in the empire was employed. It had undoubtedly happened that individuals had sent in applications to be allowed to dispose of their half-pay, and that those applications had been agreed to, before it was discovered that they ought to have been refused. In one of the cases to which he alluded, he had ordered the sale to be stopped; but unfortunately his order was given too late. He would, however, say, that in all cases in which he had learnt that the party who applied to sell his half-pay held a civil appointment, he had decidedly objected to permit the sale. An hon. friend of his, whom he then saw in the House, could speak to one case, in which he had felt himself bound to deal out hard justice to a meritorious officer. The hon. member had stated, that this arrangement was the cause why the half-pay list had not diminished since 1817. The hon. member, when he made that statement, ought to have recollected, that since that year large reductions had taken place in the army; and that it was one objection to a change of system, that reductions in one department of our expenditure always became a source of increased expense in some other department of it. The officers who were taken from the full-pay, were of course placed upon the half-pay; and hence it happened, that as the amount of full-pay diminished, that of half-pay increased. He thought it only just to the memory of the illustrious individual who lately filled the office of commander-in-chief&#x2014;he meant the duke of York&#x2014;to state that when a great augmentation to the army took place a few years ago, he filled up all the commissions which it became necessary to grant, with names of officers taken from the half-pay. He had now stated to the House the grounds upon which the arrangement had been made. The expense of it, he repeated, was distant and reversionary, and they had to set against it the large sum which had been paid down as the price of the commis-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0575"/>
<col>1135</col>
sions. He did not think that the public would be losers by it; but even if they were losers in point of pecuniary expense, they would be gainers by it in point of the greater efficiency which it had already given to the army.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00936"><member>Mr. Maberly</member><membercontribution> recommended the House to refer this matter to the consideration of the Finance Committee, which he had no doubt would investigate it satisfactorily. He knew that this arrangement had been productive of great benefit to the army; but whether that benefit had been purchased by the country at too great an expense, he could not pretend to decide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00937"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> approved of the arrangements which the noble Secretary had spoken of, as he thought they were such as to increase the efficiency of the army. The army had been improved by the opportunity afforded to young officers to obtain promotion. If the system recommended by his hon. friend had been followed, when war had come, the army would have been officered only by old gentlemen. His hon. friend really put the House out of humour with economy, by his plans for beggaring the service under pretence of reforming it. He was as anxious as his hon. friend for economy; but he would first of all have the establishment on an efficient footing.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00939">On the motion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the House went into a committee upon the Life Annuities Act, when the right hon. gentleman moved an instruction for leave to bring in a bill to give effect to the recommendation of the Finance Committee, by repealing so much of several acts as empowers the Commissioners for the reduction of the National Debt, to grant Life Annuities.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00940"><member>Lord Althorpe</member><membercontribution> rose to support the motion, which was absolutely necessary. The facts were shortly these: a statement had been laid before the Finance Committee relative to the financial condition of the country, drawn up in a very able, clear, and satisfactory manner, by the right hon. the Master of the Mint. It appeared, by this exposition, that these annuities had been sold at a considerable loss to the country. The evidence on which this statement was founded, was a letter from Mr. Finlayson to the Treasury. By this letter, the toss to the public was represent-
<col>1136</col>
ed as going on at the rate of 8,000<i>l.</i> a-week, and the total loss during the last three months was stated to have amounted to 95,000<i>l.</i> Mr. Finlayson stated, that he had made representations of this loss to lord Bexley, so long ago as 1819, and afterwards to lord Goderich. It was very unfortunate for the country, that these inquiries had not been followed up, as it was beyond all doubt, that however exaggerated Mr. Finlayson's case might be, the transactions had been highly disadvantageous to the country. They could not undo what had passed, but they should prevent loss for the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-00942"><member>The Marquis of Lansdowne</member><membercontribution> said, he had a petition to present, which related to a subject of great interest. It came from a body of surgeons, but it could only be presented as the petition of their president, he having signed it in the name of the whole body. It conveyed to their lordships the opinion of the surgical profession, with respect to the state in which that profession were placed, from the total absence of means of procuring bodies for the purpose of dissection. The petitioners stated that, by the law as it now stood, the profession of surgery was placed under the direction of corporations, which required persons engaging in that profession to go through a course of studies, in which the dissection of bodies formed a necessary ingredient;&#x2014;that it was subjected to considerable penalties for resorting to measures to procure the means of attending that course;&#x2014;that teachers of anatomy were subject to personal penalties; and that surgeons who had, by no fault of their own, but through the impediments thrown in their way, been debarred from the means of studying, were liable to action and to payment of damages, in consequence of ignorance, resulting from the embarrassments under which they had laboured in procuring the means of prosecuting their studies. The petitioners stated, with respect to the necessity of dissecting the human subject, that scientific men were agreed that no ingenuity which could be exercised in making models, could supply the place of the advantages to be derived from the inspection of the human subject. The moderate degree in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0576"/>
<col>1137</col>
which that which was so necessary for their instruction was supplied to them, narrowed the means enjoyed by surgeons in the pursuit of their studies. Notwithstanding that, the profession was daily becoming more numerous, and a considerable number of young students were compelled to pursue their studies in other countries, and particularly in France, where great facilities were afforded to them in procuring the necessary instruction. The present was not the proper opportunity to point out the means by which relief might be given to the profession; but he did not think that parliament would find it impossible to provide, without injuring those feelings which existed in the public mind, if not a complete, yet a much more adequate supply of human subjects than that which now existed. He thought the best way to proceed, in the first place, would be to repeal the existing law.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PENRYN DISFRANCHISEMENT BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00948"><member>Lord J. Russell</member> moved the second reading of this bill.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00949"><member>Mr. Manning</member><membercontribution> opposed the further progress of the bill; and, after referring to the evidence taken by the House upon the subject, contended that it was not sufficient to warrant the severe course now recommended. James, the petitioner upon whose recognizance the inquiry took place, had admitted, that the whole was a base conspiracy. He also complained, that the bill contained only ten lines referring to Penryn, and seventeen pages relating to Manchester; to which place, without the previous sanction of the House, it was proposed at once to transfer the right of election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00950"><member>Mr. Stewart</member><membercontribution> contended, that the bill was contrary to the first principles of justice, and confounded the innocent with the guilty. The present generation was to be visited for the sins of the last, and offences of twenty years' standing were raked up to afford a pretext for disfranchisement. If the noble lord would bring in a bill to inflict an equal punishment upon the giver and the taker of a bribe, it should have his I hearty support: at present the visitation was quite unequal, or rather the most guilty part was allowed to escape. At all events, before the second reading of the bill, it was extremely improper to introduce the name of Manchester.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00951"><member>Mr. D. Barclay</member><membercontribution> expressed his desire to say a few words in defence of the borough he represented. He argued, that it would be preposterous to act upon the evidence already taken, especially after the proof since afforded that the petition against his hon. colleague originated in a conspiracy. New facts had come out since the last session, which not only justified, but imperatively required, every member, as an act of justice, to change the opinion he had previously formed against the borough of Penryn. A most unfair prejudice had been excited against the character of the borough; and in a petition recently presented from the burgesses, they were willing to place the disfranchisement of Penryn upon the issue of the proof that a conspiracy had existed, founded upon falsehood, and that out of it arose the petition against his hon. colleague. The hon. member (Mr. Manning) had read a letter from one of six conspirators, acknowledging the fact, and that the object was to extort money from the two members.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0577"/>
<col>1139</col>
He was persuaded, therefore, that hon. members would reconsider the subject, before they decided against the elective franchise of Penryn. The fact was, that Penryn formerly was a close borough&#x2014;as close as Knaresborough, Old Sarum, Appleby, and a hundred others; the two members were returned by two baronets, each elector regularly receiving twelve guineas for his vote. In 1807, an attempt was made to open the borough, and it then ran considerable risk of disfranchisement. In 1818, the same danger was incurred; but at the present moment it was a reformed place, and the House would hardly disfranchise it because a few only out of four hundred and fifty voters were corrupt. A member who had canvassed the borough had sworn, that out of the whole number not ten would have accepted a bribe. It was repugnant to every principle of justice to adopt the course of proceeding now recommended. It would be scouted in the lower courts, and he hoped that in that House it would receive no countenance. If this borough were to be disfranchised on the ground of the notoriety of its corruption, why were not other boroughs to be similarly punished which were known to be guilty of the grossest corruption? Why was not this argument of notoriety to be applied to the close boroughs; such as Gatton for example? If notoriety was to be an argument good only against open boroughs, would not the public conclude that the House had some reason of its own for its partiality to close boroughs? Would it not recal the memory of that famous petition, in which it was offered to be proved, that one hundred and forty-four peers returned three hundred members to that House; that one hundred and eighty-seven other members were returned by commoners, and the remaining one hundred and seventy-one were all that were returned by the independent boroughs and cities. What had been the effect of the disfranchisement of Grampound? It had only given two seats more to the aristocracy? He had been told that the expense of the mere preparations for the contest at the last election for the county of York, amounted to 150,000<i>l.</i> Such an expense roust prevent any private gentleman from offering himself as a candidate. He would conclude with protesting against the disfranchisement of Penryn, as an act most harsh, oppressive, and unjust.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1140</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00952"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;I rise at this period of the debate, partly because I believe I am already in possession of the various views entertained on this subject, and partly because it is not impossible the line I am about to suggest may meet with the acquiescence of the noble lord, and thus preclude the necessity of a protracted discussion. The bill introduced by the noble lord proposes to declare the absolute disfranchisement of Penryn, and the transfer of that franchise to Manchester. My hon. friend behind me (Mr. Manning), and the hon. gentleman who spoke last, contend, not only against that course, but against the whole of the bill. They deny that there is any ground for the disfranchisement of this borough, and consequently they oppose the transfer of the elective franchise to any other place. On the present occasion I shall speak with reference to that part of the question only. I am for taking an intermediate course. I am prepared to vote in concurrence with so much of the noble lord's proposal as goes to disfranchise the borough of Penryn; but I am not prepared to affirm the proposition of the transfer of that franchise to the town of Manchester. The bill the noble lord has introduced in the present year differs from that affirmed by the House of Commons last year, and sent up to the House of Lords. This bill embraces two distinct objects&#x2014;one in which the execution of justice is concerned, and which inflicts a penalty on a borough assumed to be delinquent; the other, I which involves a consideration of mere policy, namely, the place to which the franchise shall be transferred. In making these observations, I propose to keep the consideration of these two objects as distinct from each other as they really are in themselves. I shall consider first, what justice requires to be done with regard to the borough of Penryn; and next, what policy suggests we should do with the forfeited franchise, if we should decide that it is to be transferred. 1 am not prepared to concur with the two hon. gentlemen who have preceded me, in denying the necessity of the disfranchisement of this borough. The question has been already decided by this House; and if we mean to put an end to litigation, we must adhere to the decisions of the House. This subject was under consideration last year; the bill did not pass tacitly through the House, nor without attention being called to it in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0578"/>
<col>1141</col>
its various stages. We must now conclude, that the sense of the House was then declared. There was a question, I remember, in the committee, as to whether the franchise should be transferred to the adjoining hundreds. It is impossible to deny, that, owing to accidental circumstances, the sense of the House was not taken on that point so fully as it was desirable it should have been. Still it was taken; and, on the third reading of the bill, which went to the disfranchisement of the borough, on the ground of the long-continued prevalence of notorious corruption, the sense of the House was deliberately taken. There was a division, and the numbers were one hundred and forty-five in favour of the bill, and thirty-one against it, giving a majority of one hundred and fourteen, or more than four to one against the borough. If, then, the decisions of this House are to be deemed final, unless new facts can be presented to us, let us not consent to waste our time, but proceed with the duty we have to perform, lest we induce the country to distrust our judgment by shewing that we distrust it ourselves. The House has decided on this question, after hearing evidence at the bar; and am I now to be called on, when the material facts have passed out of my memory, to reconsider that decision? Is it not quite evident, that I must be less able to come to a fair and just decision than I was last session, when the evidence was fresh in my mind? I consider the judgment of the House with respect to the disfranchisement final, so far as the House is able to pronounce a final judgment. I acquiesce in it on the ground that there must be some termination to matters of this kind. Those who are opposed to that decision have a perfect right, if they think lit, to divide the House on the third reading of the bill. But as they were originally only thirty-one in number, I think they have but a slight chance of success. I, for one, feel perfectly justified in considering that as a final and deliberate judgment. Having listened attentively to the evidence given at the bar on this subject, and read the Reports of the Committee with reference to it, I feel myself bound to adhere to the decision of the House, that there was such an improper exercise of the elective franchise as warranted the House in taking that franchise away from the borough. I think the judgment of the House was strictly consonant to the prin-
<col>1142</col>
ciples of equity. I agree that these privileges are not to be treated as the property of the electors. They do involve considerations of public trust; and if they are abused by the majority of the electors, the innocent parties must take the consequence of their association with the guilty.&#x2014;It was said in the debate last year, that we must confine our deliberations to the proofs of delinquency at the last election. But I never could acquiesce in the justice of that observation. I do think that the long continuance of these practices of bribery and corruption in the traffic of votes, is a material point in the case of any borough, which the legislature never can exclude from its consideration. There is one fact which I cannot conceal&#x2014;that on three successive occasions this borough has been brought under the consideration of the House. On the first occasion, I was not in parliament, but I must have confidence in the decisions of former parliaments. I cannot disregard them when I am called to sit in judgment on similar delinquencies. I do not say this fact is of itself conclusive; but it is a material element, by which the judgment should be influenced. The election of 1826 was not the only occasion on which this borough was accused of corruption. In 1807, a committee of this House, which sat on the contested election of that year, resolved, that sir C. Hawkins, one of the sitting members, had been guilty of bribery and other corrupt practices. The same committee reported, that three persons, whom they named, and other electors, had been engaged in these corrupt practices. In 1819, the return for this borough was again contested, and the Report of the Election Committee stated, that Mr. Henry Swann, one of the sitting members, had been guilty of bribery, and that three other persons had been concerned in corrupt practices, in order to influence the previous election. It appeared, also, that eight electors had received bribes to induce them to vote. In 1827, we again find this borough of Penryn under the notice of the House. Former warnings did not succeed in extirpating their corrupt practices, and another committee had occasion to report, that gross bribery and treating had prevailed during the last election, though the committee entirely acquitted my hon. friend and his colleague of any participation in the corruption.&#x2014;When I am called upon to consider whether we shall now
<image src="S2V0018P0I0579"/>
<col>1143</col>
deprive this borough of its elective franchise, is it possible to exclude the important fact of its former delinquency? If it had been only found delinquent in 1827, the propriety of disfranchisement would be less apparent than when it is pronounced after a long series of similar practices. My hon. friend is of opinion, that the evidence against this borough is founded in conspiracy. I hold the parties in the greatest disgust and reprobation, who are capable of entering into a conspiracy to extort money from the sitting members; but it does not follow that the evidence should be disbelieved on account of the conspiracy, if there was one. I place in a different point of view the conduct of the parties who produced the evidence for the purpose of extorting money, and the credit due to the evidence, from whatever motives it may have been produced. I view these motives with the greatest reprobation, but it is another question whether the House should refuse credit to the evidence, even if it be derived from so impure a source. On these grounds, I cannot deny my consent to so much of this bill as goes to take away the privilege of the borough of Penryn to return representatives to this House. I should also be prepared to give my opinion on the other part of the bill, which involves considerations of policy, if this was the single question of this nature presented to the House in the course of the present session; I mean that part which determines to what place the elective privileges should be transferred. I will not, on this occasion, pronounce any opinion on that part of the bill. I will not say whether I think the transfer should be made to the Hundreds, or to any populous town. The House will understand me, when I say, it is possible we may have this session to deal with two places in this manner. Before, then, we determine to appropriate the franchise of one of them, let us know whether we shall have one or two to deal with. That is an important consideration in deciding on the policy of this question. This very night, the hon. gentleman (Mr. Tennyson) had a motion for concluding a case of a similar nature. It seems to me that it would be quite unfitting to decide this point, while there is another case in which we shall have to act judicially; as we shall have to do with regard to the borough of East Retford. The hon. gentleman deprecated any discussion this
<col>1144</col>
evening; but I was prepared, if he had persevered, to have gone into the consideration of the question. As, however, he postponed it, on reasons with which I do not quarrel, to Friday night, I abstained from interfering. Now, I propose, before we determine whether or not we should transfer the franchise hitherto exercised by the electors of Penryn, to the Hundreds, to Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, or any other place, we should be enabled to determine whether we have one or two boroughs to disfranchise. No disadvantage can result from postponing this part of the question, until that very important fact is known. This bill provides not only that Penryn shall be disfranchised, but that the franchise shall be transferred to Manchester. I know the noble lord is warranted by precedent in following this course; but I must consider it unjust. I will not say what opinion I entertain as to the place to which the transfer is proposed; but I do think it more consonant with the practice that prevails in courts of justice, that before we appropriate the spoil, we should decide whether the party is delinquent. I do not advise the House to send the bill to the Lords, merely forfeiting the franchise of Penryn, because that would make them the arbiters of our privileges; but I do say, that we ought to postpone all consideration of the place to which we should transfer the franchise, until we have determined whether there is ground to forfeit the franchise. The naming of the place enlists new feelings, new hopes, and new expectations, which may possibly influence the judgment, as it would not have been influenced if it had remained a mere question of abstract justice. It would have been better in the case of East Retford, also, if the bill had named no place to which the franchise is to be transferred. When the bill had passed through the committee, after the guilt of the delinquent borough had been proved, so as to leave us at liberty to transfer the franchise elsewhere, we might have named the place to which it was to be transferred without telling a powerful party out of doors, and perhaps in this House, that they have an interest in pronouncing the penalty on the accused borough. If the noble lord should consent to the course I propose, lie will postpone the second reading until the case of East Retford is disposed of, or, at least, until it is decided whether that borough shall be disfran-

<col>1145</col>
chised. I concur in the disfranchisement of Penryn, but I give no opinion as to the transfer of the franchise to Manchester. If the noble lord would rather not take the sense of the House on the second reading, but on the committal of the bill, I am willing to agree to that course, if he will postpone the committal until we know the determination of the House as to East Retford. On that understanding, I am prepared to give my formal acquiescence to the whole bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00953"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> said, he was ready to consent to the course suggested by the right hon. gentleman. Certainly he did not wish to pledge the right hon. gentleman, to the proposition that the franchise should be transferred from Penryn to Manchester. Perhaps the right hon. gentleman would have no objection to the bill being committed <i>pro forma</i>, reserving the discussion of the clauses until after the decision of the House on the case of East Retford. As he wished to stand well with the House, he would shortly explain why he had followed the course to which the right hon. gentleman objected. In the case of Grampound, the bill, in the first place, disfranchised that borough, and transferred the representation to Leeds. When it was committed, various propositions were made as to the place to which the transfer should be made. It was considered perfectly an open question as to what should be done with the forfeited franchise. It was suggested to him in this case, that it would be better to keep the two questions separate; that by one bill the offending borough should be disfranchised, and the representation disposed of by another. Acting on these suggestions last session, he had brought in a bill merely to disfranchise the borough of Penryn, without mentioning any transfer whatever. But, as it often happened, he found the inconvenience of this course only after he had entered upon it. It reduced him to this difficulty: the bill might have gone through that House and the House of Lords, by which means the number of the members of that House would have been diminished, and it would have been out of the power of that House, without the consent of the House of Lords, to fill up the vacancy. That struck him as a serious objection, and he thought it more advisable to join the two bills together. If a bill of pure disfranchisement only was passed, the vacancy in the representation would re-
<col>1146</col>
main to be filled up, in point of form, by the Crown, acting by the advice of ministers, instead of the advice of that House, which was the course their privileges seemed to require them to follow. He was not prepared to say that the different course suggested by the right hon. gentleman was not wiser or safer than either of the former, but he confessed it had not occurred to him. He could not agree that the naming of the place created a sort of interest by which members might be induced to condemn the borough. He was ready to fix the committal at any time the right hon. gentleman might please.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00954"><member>Mr. A. O'Neill</member><membercontribution> asked, with what consistency the members of that House could vote for the disfranchisement of this borough on the ground of its corruption? Who of them could lay his hand on his heart, and say, he had never directly or indirectly, induced those who had not the benefit of his education, to commit these crimes for the sake of political power? Such members alone could vote for this bill without impugning their consistency. Of the one hundred and forty-five members who had voted for it last session, two-thirds at least had obtained their seats by the same means. This was not his sentiment, individually, but that of all England, which looked with indignation on the very sub-orners of this perjury sitting in judgment on the perjurers. No member could honestly vote for that bill, unless he could lay his hand on his heart, and declare that he had not expended a single shilling to purchase his return. He would himself vote for the bill, provided he was assured that every member would come forward and state as he divided: ' I, for one, have not been guilty of bribery or corruption; I have never induced a single individual to commit crimes similar to those of which the electors of Penryn have been guilty. But as long as such men sat as the judges, he would vote for the acquittal of the borough. What must be thought of the consistency of the members of the British House of Commons, who made their way into it with agents, bribing right and left? He was not the advocate of bribery, nor against the punishment of corrupt voters; but he would not countenance the inconsistency and injustice of suborning men to commit perjury and afterwards punishing them for it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PAROCHIAL SETTLEMENTS (SCOTLAND) BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00956"><member>Mr. Kennedy</member> moved the order of the day "for going into a committee on this bill."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00957"><member>Mr. Estcourt</member><membercontribution> wished the measure to be postponed until after the select committee appointed on the motion of a noble lord (Stanley) on the law relating to the passing of Irish vagrants, had made their report. As the law now stood, an Irishman residing in Scotland for three years had a claim for a settlement; but under this bill seven years were required. There was no reciprocity in the measure, it was entirely in favour of Scotland, and against England. Now, he thought that no bill ought to be passed until some general principle that would include the entire empire was agreed upon. He would therefore move, "that the bill be committed on this day six weeks."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00958"><member>Mr. James Grattan</member><membercontribution> seconded the motion. The House ought to proceed on a general principle, and not with reference to any particular part of the empire. If this bill was passed, it would have the effect ten or eleven years hence, of excluding all Irish labourers from Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00959"><member>Mr. Kennedy</member><membercontribution> denied any such intention. On the contrary, he regarded the Irish as a valuable class of men, who had conferred great benefits upon Scotland. The hon. member had declared that there was no reciprocity in this matter; but he seemed to forget that England possessed that which Scotland had not, namely, a law of removal. If he were to ask the House to grant him a law of removal for Scotland, he did not think it would be refused; but still he did not ask for it, because it could not be carried into effect without a parochial rate levied upon each parish. That remedy for the evil, therefore, he did not seek, because it would create another evil, which the people of Scotland were most desirous to avoid. They only asked for a better term of settlement; and he really thought the propositions of his bill both moderate and reasonable. The committee of the noble lord merely professed to inquire into the passing of vagrants; but as Scotland had no power to pass, he conceived that no good could result from delay. He did not wish to put a stop to the passage of the Irish into Scotland, but he wished to put an end to the migratory disposition of the Irish and, by compelling them to settle in one place instead of roaming through the country, to make
<col>1148</col>
their industry advantageous to themselves and to the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00960"><member>Mr. S. Rice</member><membercontribution> said, that if he saw anything in the bill which could be rendered injurious to his country he would oppose it. No Subject, however, could be of more importance than the constant emigration of the Irish population. If left to follow its course unopposed, it must be attended with consequences the most calamitous. He was friendly to the present bill because he thought that this country should not add to the inducements which brought the starving population of Ireland from their homes, and hold out the temptation of settlement in England or Scotland, in addition to the high wages and means of living which they at present afforded them. He thought it but just and expedient, that an Irish family should not be able to acquire a right of settlement upon the same terms and with the same ease as a family of English.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00961"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> wished the bill to be postponed until it should be seen what bearing it had upon a measure, somewhat similar, with respect to Scotland, which was about to be proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00962"><member>Mr. Kennedy</member><membercontribution> acquiesced in the proposal of the right hon. gentleman, and the further consideration of the bill was postponed to the 2nd of May; as was also the Scotch Vagrants bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SUPPLY OF WATER TO THE METROPOLIS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00963"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> said, that his hon. colleague had last session brought the subject of the Supply of Water to the western part of the Metropolis before the House, and he understood that a commission had been appointed to inquire into the subject. He wished to ask the right hon. Secretary what progress had been made in that commission. He begged also to suggest that its terms might be enlarged, and that if the commissioners found any defect in the supply they should be empowered to inquire into and suggest the remedy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00964"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that the commission was appointed by his predecessor, Mr. Sturges Bourne. The individuals composing that commission were Dr. Roget, Mr. Telford, a civil engineer, and Mr. Brande the chemist, three gentlemen of eminence in their respective professions. When he had come into office, he was applied to by the commissioners to know if he would sanction the taking of certain
<image src="S2V0018P0I0582"/>
<col>1149</col>
surveys and levels. His answer was, that he wished to carry the intentions of parliament, whatever they might be, into effect, and that those intentions were to be ascertained by the addresses. Upon a reference to them it appeared that the commission was authorized to inquire into the quantity, quality, and salubrity, of the water. The best course, as it seemed to him, would be to move for a copy of the commission, and of the correspondence between the commissioners, and the office of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. He was glad that the subject had been mentioned, because, if it should appear expedient to give new powers to the commission, there was plenty of time for that purpose; but he still thought that the duty of taking levels and employing engineers, with a view to any amendment of the supply, should be left to the private companies which would no doubt arise if the present system was found inefficient, and not be undertaken by the public. Of this he was certain, that if the water at present used was proved to be insalubrious, and that a supply from some different source was required, the metropolis had spirit enough, and opulence enough, to provide that supply; and that the duty of procuring it would be much better left to personal speculation than be attempted by the government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00965"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> concurred in the opinion of the right hon. Secretary, that the business of taking levels would be better left to individual speculation. But perhaps it would be as well to add so much new matter to the instructions of the commissioners as would authorise them, if they found the present system defective, to consult upon and suggest a remedy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00966"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that the commission already possessed that power, and the right hon. gentleman then moved for a copy of the commission and correspondence, the production of which was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LICENSING SYSTEM.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00967"><member>Mr. Estcourt</member><membercontribution> rose in conformity with the notice which he had given. It would, he said, better answer the object which he had in view not to enter into any discussion on the present occasion. If the House would allow him, he would bring in the bill, for the purpose of having it read a first and second time, and committed <i>pro forma</i>. In the committee the blanks would be
<col>1150</col>
filled up; and the bill might be re-committed after the holidays. By adopting this course, the magistrates at the various quarter sessions would have the means of knowing what the House was about. He would abstain from saying any thing on the principle of his bill; but he begged to call the attention of the House to some of the alterations in the existing law which it proposed to make. One of the first variations which he proposed to introduce had reference to the meetings of magistrates at which licences were to be granted. He proposed that it should be enacted, that the whole of the licensing in a single district should not be confined to one day, but that magistrates should be compelled to appoint a second day; so that if any innkeeper was prevented from attending on the first day, he might have an opportunity of attending on the second. Another proposed alteration would obviate some of the objections to the existing mode of transferring licences. It went to enact, that certain periods should be fixed for those transfers; so that the transaction should be perfectly notorious. Another important alteration was this, that where the number of magistrates in any jurisdiction was small, the magistrates of the county should be introduced, so that the number should never be less than six. Another clause extended the principle of exclusion where magistrates might be suspected of any interest in the business of licensing. Another proposition Was, to wave the necessity of publicans obtaining certificates before they applied for licences, and finding sureties for maintaining order in their houses; both which impositions had been found vexatious to the parties, and of no security to the public. The last point, and one which he trusted the House would approve, was, that in every case an appeal was to be allowed against an act of the magistrates; and in order to ensure the best possible decision, the appeal was to be in every case to the county at large. It was a farther object of his measure to consolidate under one act all the statutes relative to public-houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00968"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> said, he had been a member of the committee above stairs upon the bill, and thought the House and the country were much indebted to the hon. gentleman for his exertions.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TITHES' COMMUTATION BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00970"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he had given notice, that before this bill went into a committee, he should move that it be an instruction to the committee, that they should have the power to limit the duration of any bargain or agreement entered into under the provisions of this measure to twenty-one years. He objected to this bill as it stood at present, because it appeared to him to be pregnant with injustice to the church of England. As it was now constituted, it enabled parties to enter into agreements to determine, for ever, the future stipend to be paid to ministers of the church of England. If this principle were acted on, it would be fraught with manifest injustice; for he could see no reason, why a calculation of the receipts of any given living for the last seven or fourteen years should be laid down as the allotted stipend of a minister of the church of England for all future time. Suppose such a system had been adopted two hundred years ago, what would have been its effect on the church of England? In what situation would that church have now been placed, if, two hundred years ago, provision had been made for fixing, on the ratio of the past receipts, the future stipends of the ministers of the church of England? Surely it would have created manifest injustice in many individual instances; and it would evidently have lowered the condition of its ministers as compared with other classes of the community. He might be told that the provisions of this bill would not be generally found unjust, because in several parishes, where perhaps cultivation might retrograde, the value of the produce would, at a future period, be less than it was at present, and that therefore the gains of the clergy in these parishes might be viewed as a set-off against the losses which they might sustain in other parishes where cultivation had been extended. Now, he did not wish any portion of the clergy to gain in this way, because he did not think it would be satisfactory to any party. He would suppose the commutation of a certain parish fixed at 500<i>l.</i>, taking the receipts of the produce for the preceding seven or fourteen years, and that the real value of the tithes, from peculiar circumstances, turned out to be, at a future period, only equal to 300<i>l</i>.; he did not
<col>1152</col>
wish to secure to the clergyman 500<i>l.</i>, when, if he received his tithes in kind, he would be entitled to merely 300<i>l.</i> This would be an evident injustice to the parishioners, and would doubtless be felt as such. If they took the case of the county of Norfolk, it would clearly illustrate his principle. Suppose a measure like this had been carried into effect sixty years ago, before the extensive cultivation of barley and turnips was introduced into that county, would it not have been a manifest injustice to calculate the future stipend of a clergyman on the preceding seven years' receipts? Was no allowance to be made for improvements? He wished the stipend which arose from tithes to vary according to the success of agriculture, and the amount of produce in every parish. He was anxious to promote satisfactory arrangements between parishioners and the church of England. He opposed this bill further, because he believed that, in many instances, the bishop would interfere, and prevent its provisions from being carried into effect. It was a very bad general principle, first to adopt a measure of this kind, and afterwards to afford an opportunity of its provisions being defeated, in consequence of the dislike or disapprobation of those whose consent it was necessary to obtain before those provisions could be acted on. He thought it would be very easy to propose some other arrangement better calculated to conciliate the two parties than that which the present bill offered. To show the injustice of the principle, he would suppose a lenient clergyman, who had abated his demands on his parishioners; and he would ask, if that clergyman commuted his claims, and consented to receive a stipend equivalent to the produce of the preceding seven or fourteen years, whether it would be fair that his successors should be bound by that agreement? The amount of the sum to be paid hereafter to the church of England under this bill was, it appeared, to be in accordance with the amount of the receipts for the fourteen years preceding the bargain, varying according to the price of corn; so that if the price of corn fell in consequence of an extensive importation, or from any other circumstance, then the amount of stipend must also fall. What he objected to most decidedly was, the permanently fixing, on any calculation of past receipts, the sum which was for the future to be paid to the clergymen of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0584"/>
<col>1153</col>
church of England, that sum varying with the price of corn. He could not see why there should be such a difference between this bill and the law introduced into Ireland on the same subject. If ever there was a good and beneficial act introduced into Ireland, it was the Tithe Composition act of 1823. It had been carried into operation in nine hundred and forty parishes, and the sum paid at present in consequence of these agreements amounted to 286,000<i>l.</i> Under that act the agreement could not extend beyond twenty-one years, and it was perfectly consonant with policy and justice. In conclusion, the right hon. gentleman moved, "That it be an instruction to the committee that they shall have power to limit the duration of any agreement to twenty-one years."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00971"><member>Mr. Benett</member><membercontribution> said, that this bill was founded on the same principle as the inclosure bills, by which corn-rents were reserved to the clergy; the amount of which were not fixed beyond seven years, and generally not for so long a period, and which changed with the value of corn. Bills of this kind had been passed in numberless instances, with the consent of all parties, including the bishops. The cultivation of waste lands could not be attempted in this country, without giving one third of the money expended to the tithe-owner. This was not the case if the same money was applied to burning bricks; and thus an inducement was held out to build houses and factories in preference to cultivation. If the limitation proposed by the right hon. gentleman was carried, no man would venture to expend his money in cultivating waste land. Though the tithe-owner would receive nothing additional from him during the twenty-one years of the agreement, before the profit resulting from the improvement commenced, yet when it did commence at the end of that time, the tithe-owner would enter and take one third of the produce of the land. That was the ground of his objection to the Irish act, and he was sorry to hear it had been acted upon to such an extent as the right hon. gentleman had stated. The consequence would be, that an enormous property would be sacrificed, which would prevent any future attempt to cultivate the bogs and waste lands of that country. He had been personally attacked, because he had suggested that it was desirable to have the tithes of this country commuted. Now he was sure no party
<col>1154</col>
was so much interested in that measure as the church itself. The collection of tithes operated injuriously to the church, and created, even in the lowest classes, who had the produce taken from their gardens, a great dislike to it, and a great dissent from it. He had been concerned in several Inclosure acts, in which the clergy had accepted a commutation for their tithes, either in land or in a corn rent; and they had always, to his knowledge, received great benefit from the change, especially from having no interest in that disagreeable sort of property which rendered them so obnoxious to their parishioners. The amount of the corn-rent was fixed; but on any variation of the price, either party could apply to the quarter sessions, and obtain an order to examine the returns of the market, in order to settle the rate in the succeeding seven years. The consequence of this arrangement was, that the value of the tithes varied with the price of corn, but not with the outlay of capital.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00972"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel.</member><membercontribution> But not according to the improved value of the land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00973"><member>Mr. Benett.</member><membercontribution> Certainly not: and he contended that the tithe-owner had no right to any share of his capital. If the instruction was carried, he trusted the hon. gentleman would withdraw the bill; for so limited, he feared it would do a great deal of mischief.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00974"><member>The Attorney-general</member><membercontribution> said, he agreed entirely with his right hon. friend in the view he had taken of this bill. The object of the measure was a perpetual, irrevocable alienation of the inheritance for a money-rent, to be regulated by the price of corn. He admitted that there was some ground for the topic so generally urged, that the agriculturist would not improve his land, because he could only make an agreement with the existing incumbent for his life; but he thought the period of twenty-one years would be satisfactory to the tenant, and that was the principle of the Irish act, of which he entirely approved. By that measure, there was an alienation of the tithes for twenty-one years for a money-rent. But this bill introduced a new principle, going beyond the Irish act. Another very important question related to the difficulties which would attend these commutations. Taken as accurately as they might be, how could they be definitively ascertained? Who could, in every instance, decide exactly what the church was entitled to? There might be some
<image src="S2V0018P0I0585"/>
<col>1155</col>
modus, composition, or agreement, which the successor of the incumbent might set aside. There might be claims which were not set up, though no doubt could exist that they might be enforced. Yet in a moment, under this bill, all these difficulties were to be settled. If it were carried into effect all through England, every question of uncertainty, as to the nature, species, extent, quantity, and quality, of tithes of every parish in England, must be brought to an instant and final decision. Was this a work so easy of achievement? He thought, moreover, that the principle of commuting tithes for ever, was likely to prove very injurious to many of the successors of aged incumbents, who might be drawn into bargains exceedingly prejudicial to the incomes of those successors. He was not particularly pleased with the principle of regulating the money-payment by the price of corn, which would make the parson search as anxiously into the price of corn, as brokers did into the price of consols. This scheme of alienating church property was liable to objections both ways. If the land became improved, then the commutation would be unjust to the church; if it became impoverished, the commutation would be unjust to the other party. As the bill now stood, he certainly did not feel disposed to agree to it; in his opinion, the nearer it was brought to the Irish bill, the better it would be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00975"><member>Mr. Greene</member><membercontribution> could not help thinking that the right hon. Secretary's opinion had been somewhat biassed by the sentiments of his constituents; but he must submit to the House, that the members of the two Universities knew less about parochial tithes than any other persons in the kingdom. Living in their respective colleges, they knew nothing about the bargains which were made with farmers, and the painful situations in which clergymen and their parishioners were placed in consequence of those bargains. Nothing would be more likely to induce clergymen to reside upon their livings than the removal of the present system; nothing more likely to increase the number of non-residents than the continuance of it. This bill merely went to reduce to a system the powers which the House had so given by other bills. A considerable number of Commutation bills had been passed; but they were so mixed up with Inclosure bills, that fee had not been able to ascertain their
<col>1156</col>
precise number. He would mention one fact. In the county of Bedford, out of one hundred and twenty-five parishes, sixty-one had commuted their tithes. His bill went only to allow that to be done before commissioners, which was now done every day by other means. A great many of the objections that had been made against allowing incumbents to bind up the rights of their successors, were removed by that provision of the bill which rendered the consent of the bishop necessary, before any commutation could be agreed upon. It was not proposed by the bill to alienate tithes, but merely to commute them on a footing fair to both parties. Whatever might be the fate of the bill, he certainly should feel it his duty to resist the proposition now made to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00976"><member>Mr. E. Davenport</member><membercontribution> stigmatised the present system of taking tithes, as one of the most oppressive that could be devised. After stating some instances which had come to his knowledge of the vexatious methods by which lay proprietors had, at various times, attempted to alter the modus upon hay, and other articles of produce, the hon. member proceeded to observe, that length of possession, which, in all other cases, tended to strengthen a right, had a directly opposite effect in any contest with the church; for although the contract under which a person paid his tithes might be of even two centuries' duration, the person who defended his right upon the strength of its terms was bound to the production of the deed. This, too, had another bad effect; for if any ancestor of any landholder had been guilty of any act of generosity, and had raised the amount of an incumbent's tithes without wishing it to continue beyond his life, the church immediately turned round upon him, and exacted that sum as a positive and direct modus. Great and numerous as were the evils in our legal system, in his opinion, the evils of the system of taking tithes exceeded them all; and he hoped that the proposition of the right hon. Secretary, which went to smother the principle of the bill, would not receive the sanction of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00977"><member>Mr. Estcourt</member><membercontribution> did not think it fair in his hon. friend, to infer that the mind of the right hon. Secretary had been warped by the sentiments of his constituents. He was quite sure that his own was not. Nor could he admit that the University of Oxford was incompetent to decide upon a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0586"/>
<col>1157</col>
question like the present. The resident members of the University might have had little experience in the inconvenience complained of; but it ought to be recollected, that the institutions to which they belonged were supported by tithes; that livings were attached to every college, to which the fellows were preferred in rotation; and that they who were thus preferred, being in constant communication with those they left behind, were not very likely to keep the knowledge of these inconveniences to themselves, or to be less sensible of them than others. Nothing could be more improbable, than that they would conceal from their friends, who were still resident in the University, inconveniences of so serious a nature as these were represented to be; and he did therefore think that the members of the University of Oxford were not incompetent to arrive at a just opinion upon this subject. The objection to this measure was, that it put the power of alienating property into the hands of a tenant for life. He was favourable to a temporary and experimental, rather than a permanent measure, and should suggest that the bill should be tried in the first place, for a period of twenty-one years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00978"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, it had been asked by the right hon. Secretary, what would be the state of the Established Church now, if the stipends of the clergy had been fixed two centuries ago? He would answer this question by a reference to the Church of Scotland, where a settlement for the payment of a fixed stipend to the clergy had been introduced two centuries ago. There the clergy were nevertheless respected, and in the enjoyment of moderate affluence, although they had not the power which the clergy in this country exercised of imposing tithes on every acre of waste land that was brought into cultivation. The people were contented and happy; they paid cheerfully an ascertained sum, and were not brought into the unpleasant collision with the clergy which prevailed in this country. The evil of the tithe system in this country was, that tithe was not chargeable on the soil only, but on every improvement which might be made upon it. This was a tax upon capital as well as land. It operated, besides, to prevent persons from bringing waste lands into cultivation, which would give employment to the people, and supersede the necessity of concerting plans to
<col>1158</col>
send them to Canada and other places abroad. This power of imposing an increase of tithe on improvement amounted to an actual discouragement to such cultivation, and a prohibition on the employment of the people. Now, this was a purpose for which tithes were not intended; and considering that their institution took place in barbarous times, they should continue to be strictly imposed as in those times, but should be modified according to the alterations and advances made in society. It was well known that Mr. Pitt had intended to introduce a measure, and indeed had even prepared a bill for the purpose of converting church property into three per cent stock, and paying the clergy out of that fund, instead of their being paid in the present way. An improved mode of paying the clergy would prevent the irritation that was now kept up between them and their parishioners. There should be some relaxation of the ancient mode of imposing and levying tithes, more especially now that the church was divided into so many sects. It would be better, therefore, to adopt some permanent and conciliatory mode of payment. The hon. member then referred to the state of the church in France, where the whole expenses of maintaining it did not exceed a million, chargeable on the nation. He hoped that a permanent measure would be adopted, to relieve the country from the evils of the present tithe system; and he was convinced that fifty years hence, the clergy would be more respected, and the people more satisfied, than they were at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00979"><member>Colonel Wood</member><membercontribution> denied that the exaction of tithes had been any bar to the cultivation of waste lands in England, for no such lands could be enclosed without acts of parliament; and in all the acts passed of late years, the tithe had been commuted. He hoped that the temporary course would be acquiesced in, as the measure was likely to be highly beneficial to the country, and would fall to the ground if the original plan was inflexibly adhered to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00980"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, it never was the feeling of that House to propose any bill that would have for its object any advantage over the church; but it was a principle felt throughout the country that some arrangement should be made to prevent, if possible, the perpetual wranglings between the clergy and their parishioners. The right hon. gentleman did not recommend
<image src="S2V0018P0I0587"/>
<col>1159</col>
the course which he proposed as from himself, but on the suggestion, and agreeably to the wishes, of the University of Oxford. Now, with due deference to that learned body, the subject was one on which the members of that House were as well informed as they were. As the House, therefore, understood the subject, there was no need of their being dictated to by the University of Oxford. He did not concur in the remark, that the effect of the proposed plan of commutation would be, in almost all cases, to diminish the amount paid by the parishioners to the clergyman. For instance, where a clergyman, either from liberality or leniency, received considerably less than he was entitled to if he had received all the tithes, by the proposed commutation, he would receive more than he now did, as the tithes would be appraised by sworn valuators, and the parishioners would be bound to an agreement which would make them pay more than was now exacted from them. The great desideratum of the present tithe system was the want of a fixed modus. He approved of adopting the average price of corn as a modus. It furnished the material subsistence of the people, and was therefore a standard, perhaps better than any other, to remedy the inconvenience arising from fluctuations in the value of money.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00981"><member>Mr. R. Grant</member><membercontribution> approved of the instruction to the committee proposed by the right hon. gentleman. It was expedient, in his opinion, to limit the duration of any agreement; otherwise the measure would be an injustice both to the clergy and the parishioners, and, of the two, he doubted if the injustice would not be greater to the parishioners. The Tithe Commutation bill in Ireland, corresponding to the measure now before the House, had been attended with great advantage to that country, and he anticipated the same benefit from the present one. There was such difference only between the two measures as was rendered expedient by the difference in the situations of the two countries. The hon. member expressed his concurrence in the adoption of the average price of corn as the modus for regulating the tithe in this country. He could have no objection to a more comprehensive measure which might pour a healing balm on the animosities that too frequently existed between a clergyman and his parishioners. But he thought it impossible that they could adopt a permanent commutation on the
<col>1160</col>
principle of the bill as it then stood. There were two conditions indispensable to the adoption of a permanent commutation, the one, that the commissioners should be warranted to strike the amount with reference to an estimate not only of what the value of the land was, but en what it might become by improvement on the one hand, or by deterioration on the other; the other, the establishment of some security that the fund out of which the annual payments were to be made, should be always commensurate to those payments. If the commutation were made for land, or (according to the proposition of the hon. member for Montrose) for a sum in the Stocks, a security would be obtained: but, according to the present bill, a permanent and constant payment was to be made chargeable on a variable fund. The only exemption to the perpetual character of the bill was when waste lands were brought into cultivation. Besides that there were other modes by which titheable property might be increased in value, with a correspondent increase to the clergyman; but there was no such proposition with reference to a decrease in the value of titheable property. The tithes might therefore be increased, but could not be diminished. Suppose the present bill had passed in 1814&#x2014;titheable property was at that period worth twice what it was worth in 1790. It had been decreasing in value ever since; so that under such circumstances a great and unjust burthen would have been thrown on the land. It had been said, that the principle of the present bill had been found to succeed in individual measures; but it should be recollected, that those measures had undergone examination by committees above stairs. He could not, in any view of it, assent to the principle of the measure before the House, except in connexion with the proposed instructions to the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00982"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> rose principally to guard the House from conceiving that what might be applicable to the state of Ireland on this subject was, <i>ex necessitate rei</i>, applicable to the state of England. The term of twenty-one years had been accepted by the friends of commutation in Ireland, because they could not otherwise hope to carry the measure into effect. The population on which the measures were to act, was also quite different in character. Whatever system might be adopted with
<image src="S2V0018P0I0588"/>
<col>1161</col>
reference to this country, he hoped that the enormous power which had been vested by the Irish act in the Irish bishops would not be vested by the English act in the English bishops. It had happened not unfrequently in Ireland, that where the incumbent and his parishioners had been disposed to agree to a computation, the bishop had quashed the agreement, on the ground that the incumbent had not made a bargain sufficiently good for himself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00983"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> recommended to the hon. member who introduced this bill to adopt the amendment of the right hon. gentleman. As to the machinery of the bill itself, he thought that unless it was made more advantageous to the payers, the bill would be altogether inoperative. At the same time he agreed that it would be better to have this bill with the proposed limitation than none at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00984"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> wished to make a few observations. The hon. member for Newcastle had expressed his apprehension, that if the bill was passed as it stood, the provisions of it would seldom be carried into execution. That was precisely what he (Mr. Peel) wished to avoid. He wished to have a bill that should frequently be acted on, because it was founded on the principles of justice. The hon. member for Callington had said, that the House ought not to allow themselves to be dictated to by a University. Now, nothing had fallen from him which rendered such an observation necessary. It was his duty to state to the House any opinion which might be entertained by his constituents. The hon. member would no doubt act in the same way by his constituents; and he really did not know what there was in the University of Oxford to disentitle it to be heard in that House by its representative. On the contrary, if any body was entitled to be heard with favour it was the clergy, when the subject under consideration related to the interests of the church.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SOCIETY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF<lb/> THE GOSPEL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00986"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> said, it was with great satisfaction that he saw so large an assembly of reverend prelates, as he
<col>1162</col>
wished to draw their attention to a subject which was well worthy of it. He had to present a petition from a clergyman who had been officiating in the colonies of North America, against any further grant of public money to the Society incorporated for the Propagation of the Gospel in foreign, parts. The petitioner objected to any further grant, on the ground of the inefficacy of that society, of the ignorance of the persons who directed the distribution of its funds, and likewise upon the grounds of the existence of considerable abuse in the distribution of those funds. He believed the petitioner to be a person against whose moral character nothing could be urged. The petitioner stated, that an offer of 50<i>l.</i>, and after of 100<i>l.</i>, had been made to him by a person from the society, to induce him not to bring the subject forward. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was incorporated in 1701, and had existed for more than a century, upon voluntary subscriptions and donations. In 1813 or 1814 first began grants of money from the public to the society. From that time they had gone on gradually increasing, until they had reached the sum of 16,180<i>l.</i>, as appeared from the estimates of the present year. He had reason to think, too, that the society now called for a good deal more, from the report which they had published, and from the last sermon which had been preached on its account. The society had found out that government was a good milch cow. Their lordships had all heard of this society; but very few knew the purposes for which it was originally formed. The object of it at the time it was first incorporated was to form a society for the purpose of providing learned and orthodox clergymen for the administration of God's word and sacraments in the North American colonies, where, for the lack of spirit, the king's subjects were abandoned to infidelity, atheism, popery, superstition, and idolatry. In those colonies, the great majority of the inhabitants were not of the church of England, but Presbyterians, Baptists, and other persuasions, yet the funds of the society derived from the public were solely devoted to the maintenance of church of England clergymen. The society stated their object to be the maintenance of learned and orthodox clergymen. Did they then mean to say that Presbyterians were not orthodox? The government had, however, given salaries to Presbyterians, yet
<image src="S2V0018P0I0589"/>
<col>1163</col>
the society confined their funds strictly to the maintenance of clergymen of the church of England, in those colonies where the majority of the inhabitants were not of that persuasion. This he asserted, was not a fair distribution of the funds. Was it proper that money should be taken from the public for the maintenance of an establishment which did not suit the population of the country?&#x2014;Having stated the original objects for which the society had been formed, he would call to their lordships' recollection one material alteration which had taken place since its institution. In 1792 or 1793, when the bill for settling Canada passed the parliament, one-tenth part of the lands were set apart for the maintenance of the Protestant clergy. An attempt had lately been made exclusively to appropriate that grant to the benefit of the episcopal clergy. That attempt had been resisted, and he hoped successfully; for a more narrow interpretation could not be given to that law, than by appropriating exclusively to the church of England that which was given for the maintenance of the Protestant clergy of all denominations, whether Episcopal, Presbyterian, Baptist, or any other persuasion. The church of England establishment, he was sorry to say, when carried out across the Atlantic, exported with it the original sins which beset it in this country; namely, a useless expense, pluralities, and non-residence. In the colony of Nova Scotia one clergyman was archdeacon of the rectory of St. Paul's with an income of 800<i>l.</i> per annum, ecclesiastical commissioner, with a salary of 300<i>l.</i> per annum, and he received from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, 200<i>l.</i> yearly, as a missionary. That was what he called being a pluralist; and this person was the proto-pluralist of the North American colonies. The first person who united in his person those three offices was bishop Inglis, bishop of Nova Scotia, who, he thought, resembled very much a certain minister of state in this country, who some years ago united in his person the offices of the President of the Board of Control, the Treasurer of the Navy, and Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland. Bishop Inglis might very properly be described as the ecclesiastical Dundas of the colonies. To return to the subject of the ultra-pluralists. There were three professors of divinity in the colonies, with a salary of 800<i>l.</i> a-year. Each of
<col>1164</col>
these professors also received from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, 200<i>l.</i> yearly. Now, he did not think that that was a proper distribution of the funds of the society. He could not see, if a person received a salary as a professor of divinity, what need there was to give him 200<i>l.</i> besides as a missionary. There were also one or two instances of archdeacons getting 200<i>l.</i> from the society as missionaries.&#x2014;He now came to the class of non-residents. Bishop Stanser, not finding it convenient to stay in America, came to reside in England, and received from the funds of the society a pension of 1,000<i>l.</i> Four missionaries who resided in England were also receiving a pension from the society; and the missionary sent to Quebec lived in Prince of Wales's Island, which was eight hundred miles distant from Quebec, and received a salary of 200<i>l.</i> a-year. In looking over the report printed by the society, he found that there were forty missionaries in Canada receiving each 200<i>l.</i> yearly. The greater part of these salaries were paid out of taxes collected from the people in England. There were twelve missionaries, each with 100<i>l.</i> a-year, and also four schoolmasters there, who only received salaries from 15<i>l.</i> to 20<i>l.</i>, though they were quite as useful, he thought, as missionaries. Their lordships should remember, too, that the people of England were paying for the maintenance of the clergy, in a country where one-tenth part of the whole lands were set apart for that very purpose; but the clergy were not satisfied with that provision, but were calling out for further grants. That provision for their maintenance had been first made in the year 1813, under a noble lord who was much interested in the colonies, in the times of profusion, extravagance, and Mr. Vansittart, who made a very bad chancellor of the Exchequer. In looking at the estimates of the present year, he found that government gave salaries of 70<i>l.</i> to two ministers, to a minister of the church of Scotland, 50<i>l.</i>; to another, 100<i>l.</i>; and to the lord chief justice, 850<i>l.</i> In comparing the salaries paid by government to those clergymen, with the salaries granted by the society, he found a great disproportion. He therefore asserted that the controllers of the funds of the society were most unprofitable stewards. He would advise the right rev. prelates, if they did not credit his statement, to turn to the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0590"/>
<col>1165</col>
noble duke, the first lord of the Treasury, and ask him what he paid for the ministers of the church of England and Scotland in the colonies. When the noble duke informed them that he paid 70<i>l.</i> to those ministers, while the stewards of the society's fund wrote down 200<i>l.</i> and 300<i>l.</i>, they would be convinced that those stewards were verily and indeed wise in their generation.&#x2014;He would now draw their lordships' attention to the expenses of this society at home. He found in the report, that the total income of the society amounted to 28,000<i>l.</i>; and their lordships would be surprised to hear what proportion of that sum was appropriated to the management of the society's affairs. No less a sum than 1,960<i>l.</i> was applied to that purpose. The different items of that expense were for officers' salaries, about 760<i>l.</i>; for taxes, 21<i>l.</i>; for printing and binding the anniversary sermon and report, 666<i>l.</i>; expenses attending the public meeting, 70<i>l.</i>; committee and other expenses, about 245<i>l.</i>; making in the whole nearly 2,000<i>l.</i> He did not believe that government had ever, in the most extravagant times, expended the same proportion of; its income for paying the expenses of the administration. If the society were only expending their own money, they might do as they pleased; but it was quite another matter when they called upon the public to pay the sum which they required. It might perhaps be told him, that the petitioner was extremely troublesome, and that it was very difficult to find any one to agree with him. The petitioner had, however, explained to him the reason of that difficulty. By a general rule of the society, the missionaries were directed to send home a report of the exact state of affairs in the places to which they were sent&#x2014; to state where they found no churches, nor congregations, and always to report the truth. The petitioner followed the direction, but was informed by bishop Inglis, that he must not do so, as the society did not like to hear unfavourable accounts. The bishop who thus put himself forth as the keeper of the conscience of the society was the proto-pluralist, he had spoken of. The petition stated, that in the space of fourteen years the society had received 131,812<i>l.</i> drawn from taxes imposed on the people, and 43,000<i>l.</i> collected under the king's authority, making a total, exclusive of voluntary contributions, of 174,812<i>l.</i> Still, more money was re-
<col>1166</col>
quired, if he were to judge from the report of the society, and the sermon preached, by Dr. Philpotts. The petitioner was a clergyman of the church of England, who had gone out to Nova Scotia, and had been transferred from place to place, with great inconvenience to himself, and from being a witness to the abuses in the management of the society's funds, he was prepared to prove that more injury than benefit to the objects of the society was the result. The petitioner stated, that the trustees were grossly imposed upon by artful representations. His lordship then mentioned several instances of reports having been made of new churches being built, and congregations attending in them, in consequence of which salaries were given to missionaries to perform religious duties; which reports were in the end found to be false, the new churches, in many cases, being nothing more than empty shells, without boards or coverings. He stated, that the established religion, instead of increasing was losing ground, and public money was granted for the purpose of paying missionaries to persuade the people of Lower Canada, where the Roman Catholic was the established religion, to reject the errors of Popery&#x2014;thus maintaining a war against the established religion of the country. His lordship then presented the petition, which was signed by Cornelius Griffin.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00987"><member>The Bishop of London</member><membercontribution> said, that the petition was incorrect in many particulars, and a spirit of misrepresentation pervaded it throughout. Hemustsay, that the great misfortune of the society was, that it had been chosen by the government to be the means of conveying aid to the clergy of the established church in America. It was in 1813, that the government had first given pecuniary assistance through the society. The noble lord might imagine that 70<i>l.</i> a-year was enough for a clergyman of the church of England, but he did not think 200<i>l.</i> a-year more than enough, when he considered how dear many of the necessaries of life were in that country. The government had applied to the society to be the channel of conveying assistance to the ministers of our church in America; and he could assure the noble lord, that no individual belonging to the society derived either emolument or patronage from the circumstance. Nor did the society obtain by it any influence, it only relieved the government from the charge of pro-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0591"/>
<col>1167</col>
viding for the clergy of the colonies. With respect to the grant of 1813, it was made that ministers, whose income did not exceed 70<i>l.</i> a-year, might receive an addition through the society. At that period, lord Bathurst agreed to recommend the grant to parliament. In 1820, in consequence of representations made to this country from Nova Scotia, the grant was extended; and it had since been, on the same account, increased from time to time. Whatever the noble lord might think, it seemed to him that these grants were judicious: they were given to support religion in North America, and not for the support of the society. As to what the petition stated about churches not being built when clergymen were appointed, the increase of the population rendered more clergymen necessary, and one had always been appointed whenever it had been represented that a church was built. The average expense of building a church there was probably from seven to eight hundred pounds, and it sometimes happened, that the people who wanted a pastor had not been always able to build a church. Some of the people were very indigent; and being attached to the religious principles they had always followed, were willing to submit to privations for their sake. Under such circumstances, he thought it was right to grant them assistance in building a church. These churches might be longer in building than was desirable; they might remain shells after the time announced for their completion; but, at present, he believed, that all the churches stated to be built were in a fair way of completion. There had been 101 churches built in Nova Scotia, twenty were now building, and some progress had been made in erecting twenty more. The number of clergy was not proportionate to the number of churches; for, in many cases, they did duty at two or three churches; and it was to them an increase of labour, but not of emolument. He must also state, that there were a number of persons who would follow the church of England, being attached to its doctrine and discipline, but there was a want of the means of building churches; and therefore they went to the Dissenting chapels. The fact was, that the increase of Dissenters arose, in a great measure, from the want of churches of the established religion; wherever the people found no such church,
<col>1168</col>
they went to the first teacher they could meet with. He believed the petitioner to be a well meaning, but very much deluded, man, having a mind open to suspicion, and a vehement temper. The right rev. prelate then read an extract of a letter from Dr. Inglis, bishop of Nova Scotia, dated February 11th, 1826, stating his reasons for sending the petitioner home, and describing him as speaking so harshly of other persons, that it was impossible he could be of any use. He had been tried in two or three situations, and had failed in all. It was on account of his having displeased both his ecclesiastical superiors and the civil authorities, that it was found impossible to keep him in that country.&#x2014;Whatever blame might attach to the proceedings of the society, he was willing to bear his full share of it: he denied that, on the part of the society, there was any lavish expenditure of public money. In fact, the society was desirous of being relieved of that part of their duties, which exposed them to such an imputation. A proposal of this nature had been made to government a few years ago, and it was only owing to some peculiar circumstances of the times that it was not accepted. It should be remembered, that the society had very large concerns in the East, which had nothing to do with America, and that the greatest portion of its revenue was applied to defray the services in the former. The expenses of management fell entirely upon the private funds of the society.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00988"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> said, that the real question to consider was, whether the society did or did not mismanage the funds it received from the public. He would, on Friday next, move for a committee to inquire into the conduct of the society.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00989"><member>Earl Bathurst</member><membercontribution> said, there was no ground for the imputations which had been cast upon the society. From every opportunity he had had of examining into its conduct, he could bear witness to its zeal, probity, and discretion. The service of North America constituted but a small part of its duties. The society held an extensive correspondence with all parts of the world, and the charge of 600<i>l.</i> a year was, in his opinion, very moderate. The noble lord had referred to measures which he (lord B.) had suggested, when he was Secretary of State for the Colonies; but the fact was, that money had been advanced on that service prior to the period

alluded to. The noble lord had argued, that as the public bore so large a portion of the expense, no new missionary ought to be sent out until the people of the colony had expressed their want of a spiritual teacher, and that they should then bear their portion of the burthen of supporting him. But he would remind the noble lord, that when an establishment of the church of England was formed for North America, the government forgot to form any provision for the support of the clergy, and for the building of churches, or of places of residence for the ministers. It was owing to the exertions of the society that these objects had been accomplished. The noble lord had said, that in every parish in North America a complete provision had been made for the support of the clergy, by appropriating to their service one-tenth of all the waste lands. The proportion set apart for this service was not one-tenth, but one-seventh; but then, it must be recollected, that the lands so appropriated were perfectly unproductive. He was perfectly satisfied that 200<i>l.</i> a-year was a small sum to induce any clergyman to submit to a banishment to North America; and he had found it difficult to procure fit persons for so inadequate a remuneration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00990"><member>Lord Calthorpe</member><membercontribution> said, that, from all he knew of the society, it had no reason whatever to shrink from any inquiry that might be instituted into its conduct. He should rather be the advocate for the inquiry proposed; but he thought the House, after what they had heard from the noble lord opposite, must be satisfied, that it would be dealing most unsparingly to refuse to judge of the real merits of the society, merely upon what had passed in that House. With respect to the proceedings of the society in North America, he was by no means sufficiently informed to speak in a satisfactory manner; but from what he did know of the general management of the funds by the society, he should be inclined to think that its resources were applied in North America usefully, beneficially, and with judgment. There were a hundred millions of individuals who had claims upon this country, and when this was considered, the House might form some idea of the immense field of labour on which the religious societies had entered. They were diffusing spiritual assistance to people who were living, not in the practice of harmless immoralities, but in habits of
<col>1170</col>
all that was hateful and impure in superstition. It was clear that the utmost range should be given to such a society. After all that could be done, a vast portion of that territory would remain buried in the darkness of superstition and idolatry. As far as he was acquainted with the measures taken for the mitigation of that deplorable state of ignorance in which the Indian empire was plunged, they were highly valuable. Their prejudices were not insulted wantonly, but the pure spirit of Christianity was insinuated in a way the most likely to conciliate and improve. For his own part, he could not regard the exertions of this society in any other light than as indispensable preliminaries to those civil immunities and advantages, which it was the duty as well as the interest of this country to bestow upon her colonial possessions. The labours of that society were calculated to prepare their minds for those benefits which it must be the desire of every man to see them possess.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CORPORATION AND TEST ACTS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00992"><member>Lord Holland</member><membercontribution> said, he rose to present a petition, numerously and respectably signed by the Protestant Dissenters and other inhabitants of Norwich, praying for a repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts. He had several other petitions of a similar description. It was not his intention, in presenting them, to anticipate any discussion which was likely to arise when the most important subject to which they related should be brought before their lordships. It had been his fate for twenty years to present similar petitions. His feelings on those occasions had not been different from what they were at the present moment with respect to the merits of the petitions, and the course which ought to be pursued. It had ever been his opinion, that the prayers of those petitions were founded upon justice, policy, and reason: it had always been his conviction, that the persons interested had claims upon the indulgence, and even upon the gratitude, of the government. Hitherto he had presented those petitions doubting of any great advantage in presenting them; but now, when he looked to the votes of the Commons of England, he did say that he presented the petition with a perfect feeling, that the time was not far off when this great measure would receive the sanction

of the parliament. He believed that the other House was, at that very moment, employed in considering the best mode in which they could carry their object into execution. Upon that point it would ill become him, at the present, to offer any remarks. He should accept any concession made by parliament towards the attainment of the object which the petitioners had in view; but he should not consider that object fully attained, unless the petitioners procured that which he had always recommended them to pray for, and for which Mr. Locke had strenuously advised them to contend&#x2014;absolute liberty&#x2014;just and true liberty&#x2014;equal and impartial liberty&#x2014;a complete equality of civil rights.

<title>CRIMINAL LAW.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00993"><member>The Marquis of Lansdowne</member> moved the order of the day for the second reading of the two bills which he had introduced for the consolidation and improvement of the Criminal-laws. He thought it right in the outset to state, that although he was strongly satisfied of the utility of the bills, he would not have attempted any improvement of the Criminal-law by propositions of his own, if he had not recently been in a situation which enabled him to obtain that information and assistance, which alone encouraged him to take the subject into his hands. He had been induced to proceed in his object, by being in communication with the intelligent and learned gentleman who filled the office of under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Phillips), and with another learned gentleman, who had devoted much of his attention to the improvement of the technical language of the law, and who, in some acts recently passed, had effected the most important improvement, by constructing laws, so that their meaning was made accessible to the capacities of almost every individual in the country.&#x2014;He would shortly state the substance of both the bills, which he proposed should proceed <i>pari passu</i> through their different stages. The first was a bill to consolidate and amend the statutes relative to offences against the person. Their lordships would recollect, that some years ago a discussion had taken place in that House and amongst the public, with respect to the state of the Criminal-laws. The right hon. gentleman who then and who now filled the office of Home-secretary, had
<col>1172</col>
turned his attention, most commendably, to the improvement of that portion of the law, and he carried certain amendments into effect, which had greatly simplified the laws upon this subject. But it was impossible to effect all his object at once, and there therefore remained a large description of statutes, relating to personal violence, scattered over the wide surface of the voluminous collections of laws, and which might, with the utmost advantage, be brought under one head and title&#x2014;the title of the bill which he then held in his hand, for consolidating the laws relating to offences against the person. Those laws were fifty-six in number. They commenced in the reign of Henry the 3rd, and terminated in that of his present majesty. Their lordships would find, in the preliminary part of the act, an enumeration of the statutes which it was proposed to repeal, for the purpose of re-enacting them in a more simple form. In the act he should first advert to, their lordships would find, in the first instance, that petty treason would hereafter be made the same as murder. There did not appear any longer to exist a necessity for keeping the offences separate. The only effect of keeping them as separate offences had been, to invest the parties charged with petty treason with certain privileges with respect to challenging witnesses, and which they would not have had if they had been indicted for murder. When they recollected that petty treason was only murder aggravated by some circumstances&#x2014;such as its having been perpetrated by a wife against the husband, or by a servant against the master&#x2014;their lordships would think it most extraordinary, that a person so accused should have any advantages, which the common murderer was deprived of. The only inconvenience which could arise from the proposed alteration of the law would be, the loss of certain forfeitures by the criminal. By section the third, an accessary after the crime of murder would be liable to be transported; at present he was liable only to imprisonment. By section eight, justices of the peace were enabled to commit for offences beyond the sea; which heretofore could be inquired into only by the privy council. A very remarkable case, that of general Wall, I would illustrate the point to which he was calling their attention. The general was executed under very peculiar
<image src="S2V0018P0I0594"/>
<col>1173</col>
circumstances many years ago; and in that instance the inconvenience was extreme, from the necessity of carrying on the inquiry before the privy council, in consequence of the offence having been committed in a distant country. He proposed that in future all such inquiries might be carried on by justices of the peace.&#x2014;He now came to the crime of manslaughter. As the law now stood, if a person were killed under circumstances which led to a conviction of murder, but did not die till he reached England, the criminal might be tried in England; but this was not the law in cases of manslaughter. He proposed making the law in cases of manslaughter the same in this respect as the law against murder. By section 12, he proposed that all cases, in which a person should be killed by another in order to prevent a commission of a felony, should be held by law to be justifiable homicide. He now came to what he considered a most important clause, in relation to what was commonly called lord Ellenborough's act. He proposed, that in addition to the existing law against maliciously shooting, or drawing a trigger to discharge fire arms, or stabbing, cutting, or wounding, to make the law apply to the discharging of any loaded arms, for there were means of accomplishing the same object without the use of fire-arms; after the provision against cutting and stabbing, he would introduce words to include the use of any weapon for the same object, and capable of causing death. A person had recently been acquitted under this act, because he had made use of an instrument not of a nature to cut, or stab. The instrument, in his opinion was of no consequence, when the intention was manifested.&#x2014;On the same principle rested the next clause, by which it was provided, that all attempts to produce death by strangling, drowning, &amp;c. should be deemed equally capital as attempts to kill by any other methods. Nothing could be more absurd than not to punish, as a murderer, the man who might, for instance, follow another person and shove him over a bridge or into the water, with an intent to kill, and from which effort the victim might escape only by chance. By the 15th section, it was proposed to apply the same punishment for administering poison, or using any instrument to procure abortion in a woman found not to be quick with child, as when the woman was quick with child. At
<col>1174</col>
present, the law made a distinction between the two cases. The 16th section, he conceived, their lordships would think a great amendment. It was to make the concealment of a bastard child a substantive offence, instead of requiring that it should be preceded by an indictment for murder; which was necessary as the law at present stood. By the twentieth section, it was proposed to make a change in the crime of abduction, by rendering it criminal to abduct any female not only possessed of property, but having any interest whatever in property. As the law now stood, the heiress to the greatest property in the kingdom might be exposed to abduction with impunity. The twenty-first section introduced a clearer definition of that part of the law which related to the abduction of any unmarried girl under sixteen years of age; and was suggested by the unfortunate case of Miss Turner, which had occupied so much of their lordships' attention. By the twenty-third section it was proposed to enact, that a person whose consort had been abroad for seven years, if that consort were known to be living, might not marry with impunity; but should be subject to the punishment of bigamy. The sections from that to the thirtieth, proposed the extension of various punishments to offences which were now not reached; such, for instance, as impeding persons going to buy or sell corn at a market, &amp;c. The only remaining section was the thirty-first, by which it was proposed to give the judges a discretionary power of imprisonment in cases of abandoning seamen on any foreign or colonial coast. That crime was now punished, in all cases, by a short imprisonment. It was most evident, however, that there was a great latitude in the degree of its atrocity. A man might be left on a desert or inhospitable shore, under circumstances which nearly amounted to murder; yet now the captain of a vessel so acting was not liable to a greater punishment than he who sailed away leaving a sailor on the coast of France or Portugal. It was intended to arm the judges with a discretionary power on the subject. Having now come to a conclusion with respect to the bill for consolidating and altering the laws respecting offences against the person, he should say a few words in explanation of his second bill; namely, a bill proposing the Introduction of certain Amendments in the Law of Evidence. The first point related
<image src="S2V0018P0I0595"/>
<col>1175</col>
to the admission of the evidence of Quakers in criminal cases. It was singular, considering the high authority by which it had been long ago declared that the affirmation of Quakers ought to be received in criminal as it was already received in civil cases, that no alteration had hitherto been made in the law on the subject. It was the opinion of lord Mansfield, in a most able judgment, in which he stated the grounds of that opinion, that it was most expedient to make the change now recommended. In fact, the want of such a change had been, in many cases, attended with great inconvenience. It had prevented many criminals from being tried; and, in other cases, where they had been tried, it had prevented conviction. He had the means of knowing that a system of depredation on the Quakers, in the town of Manchester, had been carried on to a great extent by gangs of rogues from London, in the confidence of the protection which they enjoyed from the non-admissibility of the evidence of the persons whom they plundered. He also knew many instances in which the property of Quakers had been abstracted from mail and other coaches, in consequence of the difficulty which the present state of the law threw in the way of bringing the robbers to condign punishment. It was but a few years ago that, at Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire, a most atrocious murder was committed, in the presence of four most respectable individuals; but in consequence of those individuals being Quakers, their testimony could not be received. More recently, a forgery was committed upon the bank of Cirencester. One of the partners of the bank was a Quaker; and it so happened, that he alone was capable of proving that the hand-writing was forged; and as his evidence could not be received, the forger escaped punishment. In all other instances the oath was administered according to the form to which the party was accustomed. If a murder on the river Thames were alleged to be committed by a Chinese, and if the only evidence in his favour were a Quaker, as the law now stood, the declaration of a Lascar, after he had broken his saucer, would be immediately received, while the affirmation of the Quaker, though he appealed to heaven for its veracity, would be rejected. Why should there be any difference in the credibility of a Quaker with reference to a criminal, when there
<col>1176</col>
was none with reference to a civil case? It was remarkable that the legislature had never entertained any apprehensions of the want of veracity on the part of Quakers in civil cases. In the reign of George 1st, the archbishop of York proposed a clause in the Tithe act, excepting the testimony of Quakers. Their lordships rejected the clause; and not a single instance had been heard of in the century that had elapsed of a want of conscientious conduct in a Quaker, with reference to that act. If it was not improper to admit the testimony of Quakers in civil cases, how much less so must it be to admit it in criminal cases, where the natural conscience of man was more alive to minute accuracy of statement? The next point of his bill went to admit, in cases of forgery, the evidence of the person whose hand-writing was forged. By the law as it at present stood, the evidence of such a person was not admissible, when it could be proved that he had any interest, direct or indirect, in the transaction. Great evils had arisen from this state of things. It was now proposed to admit the evidence of any person under such circumstances; his credibility being, of course, a matter that would be weighed by the judge and jury. There were only two remaining clauses. One was, to place a person who had been guilty of a felony, not punishable with death, and who had undergone the punishment of that felony, in the situation in which he would have been placed had he received a pardon under the great seal, and to render him a competent witness in a court of justice. It was doubtful, and only doubtful, whether he was so at present; the benefit of clergy having been abolished. If it was right to do this with respect to cases of felony, it was evidently right to extend the principle to cases of misdemeanour. He had now gone through the principal clauses of his second bill. He was by no means prepared to assert that the improvements which they would introduce were extensive. There was nothing in them of a very novel or extraordinary character. But their lordships would agree with him, that on such subjects they ought to proceed by slow degrees, and with a watchful attention to the progress of legal proceedings, in order that any amendments introduced into the law might be introduced on safe and intelligible grounds. He believed that those which he had the honour to recom-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0596"/>
<col>1177</col>
mend for their lordships' attention, possessed that merit. He submitted them to the House with confidence, from the great legal assistance he had received out of the House, and also from the learned lord, (Tenterden), and from whom he had experienced not only that courtesy which he maintained towards every one, but that zeal for the improvement of the law which gave additional lustre to the many qualities by which that learned lord was distinguished in the high station which he filled with so much advantage to the country.</p>

<title>SUPPLY OF WATER TO THE METROPOLIS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00995"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> rose to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what progress had been made by the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the State of the Supply of Water to the Metropolis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00996"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that, upon a former occasion, when the same question had been put to him by the hon. baronet's colleague, he had endeavoured to give a plain and intelligible answer. He had stated, that on his return to the office which he had then the honour to fill, he had found that one of his predecessors, Mr. Sturges Bourne, had appointed a commission to inquire into the supply of water to the metropolis, and that a question had arisen as to the extent of power bestowed on the individuals appointed as commissioners under it. He had been called upon to decide that question, and his answer was, that he should be governed entirely by the view which had been taken of it by the right hon. gentleman who had appointed the commission. Upon inquiry he found that it was the opinion, not only of Mr. Sturges Bourne, but also of the marquis of Lansdowne, who had succeeded to his office, that the powers which had been conferred on the commissioners were sufficiently ample for all the objects contemplated in the commission. It gave them power to examine witnesses upon oath, and to make all such inquiries as they should deem necessary, to show the present state of the supply of water to the metropolis, and to determine its quality, quantity, description, and salubrity. A question had likewise arisen, as to whether the
<col>1178</col>
commissioners should have power to employ engineers to make surveys and to take levels. And he certainly was of opinion, that parliament had never contemplated any such thing when it agreed to the address for the appointment of the commission. He determined to refer to his right hon. friend, for he felt that it would be inexpedient in him either to curtail or to increase those powers beyond what was originally intended. He had been asked whether the commission was to make an analysis of the water. He had replied, that it would not be sufficient for the commission to make only one analysis of the water, they must make an analysis of it, as taken from different parts of the river, at different periods of the tide and of the year. He had also been asked whether he approved of the gentlemen who had been appointed commissioners; namely, Mr. Telford, the engineer; Dr. Roget, the physician; and Mr. Brande, the chymist; and he had expressed of them that approbation which their eminent acquirements richly deserved. As the commission had, on his return to office, been sitting for five months, he ventured to inquire whether they had made any analysis of the water, and when they would be prepared to make their report. He was told that the analysis of the water would be complete in about six weeks; and that soon afterwards they would make a report which would bring all their proceedings under the consideration of parliament. He trusted it was quite unnecessary for him to say, that he entertained no feeling upon this particular question. If parliament should think it right to have engineers employed to make surveys and to take levels, with a view of discovering from what quarter the best, purest, and most abundant, supply of water could be brought to the metropolis, nothing could be easier than to add the instruction to the address. He should reserve his opinion as to the propriety or impropriety of such a measure. He thought that, if the commissioners should be of opinion that there was not sufficient salubrity in the water of the Thames, there was that opulence, and that spirit of enterprise in the inhabitants of this great metropolis, which would induce them to form a new Water-company in order to secure a better supply of water than that which they had at present; and he frankly owned that he conceived such new company, and not the government, should be
<image src="S2V0018P0I0597"/>
<col>1179</col>
at the expense of making the requisite surveys, and taking the necessary levels. He was of opinion that it would be quite sufficient for the commission appointed by the Crown to make an analysis of the water, and to report its opinion upon the quality and quantity of the supply. He had laid upon the table of the House, the other day, a copy of the commission, and also a copy of all the correspondence to which it had given rise and he believed that, in a few days; it would be printed, and in the hands of every member. He, therefore, would take the liberty of suggesting, that it would be advisable to proceed no further in the discussion until they had the report of the commissioners. He could not, however, conclude, without expressing a hope that the House would pause before it consented to give greater powers to the commission than those it had at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00997"><member>Mr. S. Bourne</member><membercontribution> rose merely to confirm the statement of his right hon. friend. However, as he was upon his legs, he could not help expressing his surprise that the report of this commission had not been presented long ago. He thought that all that the commission had to ascertain was, whether the quality of the water now supplied to the metropolis was good, and whether its quantity was sufficient. He imagined that the labours, which they were appointed to discharge, might be discharged in so short a period that he had nearly limited in the commission the time within which they were to make their report; and he had only been prevented from so doing by a petition having been presented from Southwark, praying that the labours of the commissioners might be extended, to inquire into the supply of water on their side of the Thames. He had appointed on the commission one of the most able physicians, and one of the most eminent chymists, of the present day, in order that the public might have the benefit of the ablest opinions on the salubrity of the water; and he had added an excellent engineer to their number, in order that they might avoid the expense of employing individuals to take levels for them, and might have in their own body a gentleman who could give them the most satisfactory information upon all such matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00998"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, that if the commission was merely appointed to analyze the water which was supplied to the metropolis, it was wasting its time in a very idle
<col>1180</col>
and unsatisfactory manner. If the commission were not to be allowed to look at the means of remedying the present insalubrious and inefficient supply, it was worse than useless to appoint them. If they had nothing to do but to analyze the water&#x2014;which, by the by, had been repeatedly done by the first chymists in London, why had they been appointed? The physician who was appointed a member of the commission, might be the most learned of physicians, the chymist the most able of chymists, and the engineer the most expert and ingenious of engineers; but we did not want a learned physician, to tell us that the water was insalubrious, nor an able chymist to analyze its contents, nor an ingenious engineer to make surveys and take levels, unless they were also to seek for a remedy to the evils which they discovered. He was of opinion, that it would be of great advantage to the public to have any plan, which might be proposed for the better supply of water to the metropolis, executed under the authority of government; and he thought that it would be better for government to fix upon some plan for such an object, than to leave it to the whim and caprice of individual speculators. He considered the present to be one of the most important matters that had ever fallen within the remedial powers of any government. The main object to which the government ought to look in any measures which it might hereafter think proper to adopt was, to obtain water from pure sources, and not from such sources as required every thing which came from them to be filtrated previously to its being reduced to a condition fit for use. There was another part of this subject which likewise deserved the attention of parliament&#x2014;and that was, the cost of the supply of water to the metropolis. In this article, all the principles of free trade were violated and set at nought. The different water companies had established a complete monopoly. ["Order" from the Speaker.] He begged pardon&#x2014;he was aware that on the present occasion he had no right to enter upon such a discussion; but it was almost impossible to leave off. Here the conversation dropped.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CORPORATION AND TEST ACTS REPEAL BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-00999">The order of the day was read for going into a committee on this bill. On the question, that the Speaker do now leave the chair,</p>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0598"/>
<col>1181</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01000"><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member><membercontribution> said, that, from the unavoidable absence of his honourable friend, the member for Devonshire (sir T. D. Acland) it had fallen to his lot to undertake the task of laying before the House a proposition which, he trusted, would have the effect of uniting the suffrages of both parties on this great question, and which, while it extended the liberties of the Dissenters would amply provide for the security of the church. He regretted the absence of his hon. friend, because it had deprived the proposition of the influence which it would have received from his talents and weight of character. On the former discussion of this question, there had been so much ability displayed, and, he was happy to add, so much temper and moderation shewn by the noble lord and his supporters, as materially to add to the effect with which they pressed their considerations upon the House. They had already determined, by no equivocal majority, that the Sacramental tests now in existence ought to be abolished. He knew that there were among the members who composed that majority, very different feelings on that subject. Some considered every sort of test as improper; others thought it a desirable object to have some tests, but agreed, that Sacramental Tests were at least inefficient, while all concurred in opinion, that it was bad to continue a system which led to a revolting profanation of a most solemn rite of religion. That such were the opinions of those who formed that majority he had no doubt. He believed he might say with the same degree of confidence, that his right hon. friend, and those who supported him, would not think he was doing them an injustice when he stated, that he did not suppose they were opposed to the abolition of the Tests now in existence if others could be substituted, that would afford a proper degree of security to the church. He had little doubt that they would be thankful to him or to any one else, who should propose a step by which they might be exempted from a course that would seem to lay them open to such an imputation. These circumstances had induced him to hope, that some proposition might be made which would put an end to all objections, and render the abolition of the existing Tests in every way feasible. To those who had resisted the motion of the noble lord on a former evening, he would beg leave to say a few words, in or-
<col>1182</col>
der to remind them of the effects which these statutes had already produced. Persons who did not belong to the church of England were obliged to qualify themselves by taking the sacrament to hold certain offices in the State. That enactment soon led to a conference between the two Houses on the subject of Occasional Conformity, which, after some discussion, ended in a quarrel between them. Soon afterwards a bill was brought in to repeal the act for Occasional Conformity; but that bill was found to be so severe in its enactments, that after the lapse of a short time, another bill was brought in to suspend it, a bill which had been annually passed ever since. That such a bill should ever have been deemed a security to the Established Church was a point which, he fairly owned, astonished him. It might keep out of office honest and conscientious men, but it never could operate as a restraint upon men of a contrary disposition. He had hoped that the enactments of the Corporation and Test acts had become a dead letter; and therefore it was, that he had heard with much sorrow that there was a particular church in London to which individuals went, on stated occasions, to take the sacrament as a qualification for office. He was convinced that the church could receive no benefit from such a profanation of one of its most solemn and awful rites; and therefore he thought that there could be no particular desire on the part of those gentlemen who formed the minority of the former night to retain the present tests, if any other could be substituted in their stead. With respect to the gentlemen who sought the entire repeal of the present restrictive statutes, he was afraid that it might be more difficult to reconcile them to the proposition which he intended to submit to the House; for they might be of opinion, that all tests were unnecessary and improper, and be inclined not to in-cumber the boon which they sought to confer upon the Dissenters by any limitation whatever. He could understand the feeling on which they were prepared to act; but he trusted that if it were possible to frame a declaration which would give satisfaction to the members of the Established Church, and which was at the same time free from all the objections which the Dissenters naturally entertained against the present tests, they would not risk the loss of a great advantage for the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0599"/>
<col>1183</col>
accidental attainment of an advantage still greater. He did not intend to propose the taking of an oath as a qualification for office, he thought that a declaration, solemnly subscribed, would be equally effective and binding. He should therefore propose that a declaration should be made to the following effect, by all candidates for office at the time, when by the existing law, the oaths of allegiance and supremacy were to be taken;&#x2014;" I, A. B., do solemnly and sincerely declare, that I will not use any powers with which I may be invested by this office, to subvert, or to endeavour to subvert, the principles of the church of England, Scotland, or Ireland, as by law established." He had endeavoured in this declaration to avoid the use of any terms that were vague and indefinite; and he should be well satisfied to see it made a part of the noble lord's present bill. He had now stated the sum and substance of all that he had to propose. The declaration would apply equally to the privileges of the established church of Scotland, and to those of the established church of England and Ireland, and must be taken by all the king's subjects alike before their admission into any public office.&#x2014;Before he concluded, he would say a few words respecting the conduct of the clergy of the establishment. It could not have failed to strike the attention of every member of that House, that the clergy had not thought fit, except in one or two instances, to trouble the House with petitions on this subject. He inferred from that circumstance, that they reposed with confidence in the attachment of parliament to the establishment of which they were the pious and active ministers. Anxious as he was for the security of the church of England, he would confess that he thought that they had done more by their silence to advance its interest and welfare, than if they had covered the table of the House with loads of petitions against the repeal of these statutes. The right hon. gentleman concluded by moving "That it be an instruction to the committee on this bill, that they have power to provide for the taking and subscribing a declaration by all persons who would, under the existing laws, be required to take the Sacramental Test."</membercontribution></p>

<col>1184</col>
on the former evening, he was not at all insensible to the inconveniences of the present laws respecting the Dissenters. It was impossible to avoid seeing that they were full of inconsistencies, when a bill of indemnity was annually passed to suspend the severity of their enactments. It was impossible also to avoid seeing that the test which required individuals to use the most sacred ceremony of the church as a qualification for office, was a profanation of religion which ought to be continued no longer. He would candidly confess that he had voted on the former night against the motion of the noble lord, because he was not prepared to support the abolition of the existing tests, without having some declaration substituted for them, acknowledging that the church of England was an integral part of the constitution, and pledging the person taking office to consider it in that light. He was now of opinion that some declaration, such as his right hon. friend had proposed, might be framed so as to satisfy both sides of the House. He was aware it might be said, that if he was impressed by such sentiments he ought not to have voted as he had done on the former night, because it would have been easy for him, when the noble lord's bill came to its present stage, to have proposed that a similar instruction to the present be given to the committee. He must confess, that if the noble lord in his speech&#x2014;which he owned to be a most able and conciliatory speech&#x2014;had propounded any intention of substituting a declaration instead of an oath as a test, he should have given his support to the noble lord's motion. He had, however, supposed that such was not the intention of the noble lord, and had voted accordingly. He acknowledged it to be his opinion, that if the noble lord had not carried his motion on the former night, the subject would have been taken up by government; and if it had been so taken up, the repeal of these statutes would have been more satisfactory both to the government and to the Dissenters. He was aware of the utter impossibility of satisfying all parties; but he thought the instruction went a great way towards the attainment of that object, since it secured the interests of the church, while it did not offend the religious scruples of the Dissenters. He hoped it would be carried; and if so, he should no further oppose the progress of the bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01002"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> said, that he was ready thus early to offer himself to the notice of the House upon the new question submitted for their consideration. The noble lord who spoke last was right in saying that neither he nor any of his friends had either proposed or prepared any test as a substitute for those which they were anxious to revoke. On the contrary, they had asked for the total repeal of the existing law, on general principles of justice and policy, without having it in their contemplation to propose any substitute in lieu of the oath required by the Established Church. Notwithstanding what had fallen from the right hon. gentleman, he could not help thinking that unqualified repeal was what was meant by the great majority who had pronounced their opinions upon this subject on a former night. There had been, undoubtedly, an opinion expressed by an hon. friend of his, that it would be better to have a bill of suspension than one of repeal; but he could not bring himself to believe that many had concurred in a proposition of that nature. Before, however, he went further in his allusions to the general subject, or entered upon the specific proposition of the right hon. gentleman, he hoped the House would allow him to congratulate them upon the different condition in which this great question was now placed, from that it had occupied on any former occasion. They had no longer to inquire into the essential differences which formed the barrier between the established and dissenting churches, or whether or no Dissenters were worthy of holding places of trust and office. They had no longer to combat any of those theological distinctions or subtleties, which had been interposed in the form of striking difficulties, and most improperly, as he had always thought, where the question really was the adjustment of civil duties. They had no longer to grapple with that ancient principle, which provided, that no man was worthy to serve the state, of which he was a social member, unless he belonged to the creed of the dominating church. It was a source, he thought, of real satisfaction, that the question now came before them stripped of these incumbrances. It was put fairly and plainly in a different form by the right hon. gentleman, who had, in his amendment, proposed no assertion of the obsolete principle of inherent re-
<col>1186</col>
ligious disability, but on the contrary, a Declaration merely affecting the civil conditions upon which the tenure of office was to be held by those who were ready to admit the paramount obligations of the constitution. Though he thus rejoiced that the question was not what it had been, and was at length put upon fresh ground of argument, yet he could not concur in the conclusion, that any fresh declaration was necessary. He had many reasons to prevent his adopting such a conclusion. The first reason was that there being no pretensions for danger there could be no necessity for demanding security. Whether the Test and Corporation acts were originally just and proper&#x2014;whether their provisions were adequate to the presumed necessity for their enactment&#x2014;it was now rather too late to inquire. But they had at least this plausibility, or supposed advantage, in the principle of their construction&#x2014;that they were really enacted to meet an apparent overwhelming danger. At the time to which he referred, there did exist a set of men who had sought to destroy the constitution, as in church and state established. At present, what pretence was there that any declaration or religious test was called for, to protect either church or state from any particular danger? Had any complaint been made against the principles or practice of any of the Dissenters who had obtained office? And it must not be forgotten that Protestant Dissenters, if they really meant hostility to the Established Church, had had the power of fomenting their machinations during the greater part of the last half century, in which time they had been practically admitted into office. Had they, during that lapse of years, sought the subversion of the Established Church? Had they attempted to oppose the dominion of the law? Had they endeavoured to introduce disorder or civil contention into the kingdom? The answer of history was, No. If, then, they had not, he called upon the House not to sanction an imputation where no charge either had or could be made&#x2014;not to express a distrust where no confidence had been violated. His next reason against the proposed amendment was, that he saw no cause why the Dissenters should make any declaration respecting the Established Church, which they were not called upon to make towards any other establishment of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0601"/>
<col>1187</col>
state, or against any other doctrine that was supposed to be subversive of the constitution. For instance, there were those abroad who thought any established religion unnecessary&#x2014;there were those abroad who advocated annual parliaments, and universal suffrage; yet nobody dreamt of providing countervailing declarations against such constitutional innovations. There were likewise established institutions which were interwoven with the spirit of British liberty; the trial by jury for example, the independence of the judges; yet in no instance had a declaration been called for, or deemed necessary for their preservation&#x2014;And why? Because it was more politic for the state to presume, that all its subjects felt a common interest in the due maintenance of what was essentially useful for the whole, than to fritter away their allegiance into privileged or excluded classes. Better, far better, was it, to leave the opinion td prevail, that all men were bound equally to obey the laws upon the same obligation of common compact, than to take for one class, as against the rest, a form of words as a security, which elsewhere was deemed unnecessary. He would say, moreover, that this sort of verbal security was far from being the best a government could obtain. The best security for the impartiality of the trial by jury, for the independence of the judge, was the perfect confidence which the state reposed in the one and the other, and the deep implied obligation of the sacredness of the trust. In fact, these tests, when carried as they were to extreme points, excited jealousy instead of enforcing salutary obligation, and actually prevented the growth of opinion from correcting the current of antiquated prejudices. The page of history demonstrated, that exactly in proportion to the relaxation of the persecution of sects, was the leaning of the emancipated thinkers to whatever creed belonged to the influential portion of society, to which they were newly deemed eligible. Upon reference to the debates on the Occasional Conformity bill, it would be found, as bishop Burnet said, that the passing of the Toleration act had almost immediately diminished the number of the Dissenters one fourth. The reason was obvious, the bar of separation had been taken away from them, and with it that party spirit which was their main support. History furnished another striking reason of the anomalous tendency of these re-
<col>1188</col>
strictive laws, and how entirely they defeated their own expressed purposes. Never had religious wars been carried on with more fierceness than were the religious wars of France. The Huguenots at one time undoubtedly comprised the largest number of men of rank and station in France. The massacre, the persecution, and assassination, of their members by no means diminished the accession to their numbers, nor the dangers apprehended from the Huguenot Association. But when Henry 4th came forward with the edict of Nantes, which threw open power to all classes, the spell of Huguenot power was dissolved, and in less than a century, though many Protestants still remained in France, there were hardly any among them of any rank or station, the principal families of the Huguenots having merged into those of the predominant religion. So that when Louis 14th revoked the edict of Nantes, it was notorious that the great majority who had fled from that act of intolerant power were not of the station and rank in society of those who had figured as Huguenots during the reign of Henry 4th. He would say, then, that the best security of any state would be found, not in the imposition, but in the absence of these jealous and distrustful tests. Once show a confidence, a fair and honest belief in the integrity of the Dissenters, and there would be every thing to hope from their cordiality, and nothing to fear from provoked and wounded feelings. It must surely be obvious, that to ask for these tests and declarations, was to inspire distrust. Why was it, then, that persons called for their perpetuity? Was it, that in the performance of an act of tardy justice, the pride of the Established Church required a qualification or salvo, as if it were not ready to make a fair concession of its own free will, and in that full spirit of conciliation which ought to be maintained in coming to such an adjustment? He had likewise another objection to the proposed Declaration. Although the right hon. gentleman's words might be unexceptionable, yet declarations of this kind were always liable to various interpretations, according to the sense in which they were construed by those in whose behalf they were said to be taken, or by whom they were actually adopted. There was always, then, a dangerous latitude, however conscientiously suggested, in these different interpretations of the respective communities. Surety
<image src="S2V0018P0I0602"/>
<col>1189</col>
such a danger ought to be avoided. Reference had been made, on a former night, to the words proposed by Mr. Burke in the place of the present tests. The subscriber was not only to declare that he would never subvert or destroy the Established Church, but he was to carry the supposed security further; for he was not to assist or employ any person or persons, or give any vote for any person seeking corporate office or parliamentary duty, on account of their attachment to any religious opinions not being those of the Established Church. Surely that was rendering the fulfilment of the obligation practically impossible; for no man, were he a Dissenter, could doubt, that if two candidates offered themselves at the same time for his vote, being alike eligible, his bias must naturally turn towards the one who partook most of his own peculiar tenets. These were generally the objections which he entertained to the course proposed to be taken to qualify or alter the present bill. But, in stating them, he was ready at the same time to declare, that his opposition was not unconquerable [hear]. He repeated, that his objections were upon principle, but he was still ready, and indeed bound, to listen to the general opinion of the House. Placed as he was in such a question as this, involving delicate feelings and momentous interests, he would not take upon himself, for the maintenance of his own opinion, to close the door of conciliation and peace [cheers]. If there were a fair and open chance of the admission of Dissenters to the enjoyment of their just rights and privileges, with a reasonable declaration, which would satisfy the scruples of the influential organs of the Established Church, without violating the feelings of the other parties, he confessed he should be ready to listen to such a proposition, with an earnest hope and a desire to afford his best endeavours to make the Declaration mutually palatable and satisfactory. But because of his hostility to the principle of any such oath or declaration, he must be excused at that moment from either expressing his assent to or dissent from, the specific proposition, and would, for the present, remain to hear what should appear to be the general opinion of the House upon the subject; remembering that it was a discussion involving the great principle of religious liberty, and embracing considerations as important as could be submitted to an enlightened assembly.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1190</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01003"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that when this question was last under the consideration of the House, he had asked the noble lord, with the most perfect sincerity on his part, as well as for those who thought with him on this subject, for a short delay, to obviate, if possible, his final resistance to some general and fair arrangement. He had, in fact, merely asked the noble lord to give those who had" at first opposed him a reasonable opportunity of maturely deliberating on the course which it was most important they should pursue to attain a satisfactory adjustment, an opportunity which, even under ordinary circumstances, he could have hardly thought would have been refused. That request he had made with an earnest determination to apply his mind for the fair purpose for which he had asked it; namely, to consider what arrangement could then be made to settle this important question. He was induced to make the request, because he found that a considerable majority of the House of Commons had, upon fair and full debate, pronounced their opinion, that an alteration in the existing law was desirable. He repeated, that this delay he had asked with the sincerest disposition to apply his mind to the consideration of what way any arrangement could be effected with the general consent of those whose consent was indispensable for the success of the measure, and with the intention also of conciliating the feelings of the Dissenters themselves, and the other great party in the country who felt themselves concerned in the result. He wished, in fact, to see how far he could reconcile the sincere adherents of the Church of England, who must feel a deep interest in any change of this nature, to the change which the Dissenters were, under favourable auspices, desirous of accomplishing. The delay he had asked for this purpose had, however, been refused him; and refused, too, with a degree of injustice and indiscretion which he could hardly, under such circumstances, have expected. It was said that his motives were not honest, and that he wanted to get rid of the question by an artifice [cries of "No" and of "Hear"]. Most assuredly such motives had been imputed to him on the occasion to which he alluded, but he begged now to assure the noble lord, that whatever injustice had been personally inflicted upon him, and whatever motives had been unfairly imputed to him, it was impossible that any thing which had passed could seriously affect
<image src="S2V0018P0I0603"/>
<col>1191</col>
his view of a matter of such immense importance, or prevent his attempting, as far as was in his power, to promote a satisfactory arrangement, if it were attainable, and induce a continuance of that harmony which had so long subsisted between these great parties. He was glad, however, that the interruption had taken place; for it enabled him, in the time which had elapsed since the first discussion, to consider and weigh the various opinions that had been pronounced, in the shape of alternatives, or substitutes for the present law. He would enumerate what he understood to be the several arrangements that had been submitted to the choice of the House. In the first place, there were those who were ready to adhere to the existing provisions of the law, and who defended them because they were impressed with a belief that they did not entail upon the Dissenters any practical grievance. He, as well as those who had entertained that opinion, did not deny the objection, that a difficulty was imposed upon those who were called upon to take the Sacramental Test as a qualification for civil office, but they thought that the Annual Indemnity bill relaxed the painful necessity of enforcing the test as an indispensable qualification. But, as he had before said, he saw nothing more unwise than to interrupt the existing harmony between such sects; and he was free to confess, that after the late decision of the House, so deliberately formed, he was one of those who thought it useless to resist, <i>in limine,</i> the conclusion that the existing law was no longer applicable to the present State of society, and that it ought to undergo a material alteration. Viewing what had passed in this way, he could no longer think of pressing his own opinion, in the vain hope of altering what undoubtedly appeared to be the fixed opinion of the House. The alternative, therefore, of adhering to the present law, he was prepared at once to dismiss from his mind. The sense of the House had been so fairly and decidedly taken against it, that he admitted the law must undergo an alteration. In the course of the discussion the hon. baronet, the member for Devon, had thrown out another proposition, which seemed, at the time, to have received considerable countenance; namely, that there should be substituted in lieu of the Annual Indemnity bill, an annual suspension of the law requiring the
<col>1192</col>
Sacramental Test. He had pressed this himself for the consideration of the House, at the moment, when he had been afterwards taunted with improper motives and artifice. He rejoiced now, that he had been so interrupted, because he was thereby enabled to come to the present debate uncommitted and unfettered by any previous opinion. He therefore now came to the exercise of his judgment as the case really stood for consideration. The effect of this deliberation upon his part was, to convince him, that he ought to change his opinion respecting the hon. baronet's proposition, which he now thought would, in its operation, prove as inconvenient as the Annual Indemnity bill. He dismissed it therefore from his mind, because it would not remove the objections entertained by conscientious men, Dissenters, as well as of the Church of England, that the law even with such an alteration, while it mitigated the penalties, was still held over their heads as a jealous distrust. It was, also, liable to the further objection, that the suspicion so implied was a tacit recognition of the principle, that the Sacramental Test was a necessary qualification for holding office.&#x2014;The third alternative held out was, not that a suspension should be enacted, but that a given time should be prospectively named, say five years for the abrogation of the present law. He confessed he could not see the value of that proposition; for it was plainly open to this objection, that while the Church of England, would, in the interval, gain nothing in conciliation and consequent security, they would be clinging <i>pro tanto</i> to a useles annual tenure of disqualifications, still upholding jealousy and distrust, for a short term of years, without obtaining any valid security, and with the certainty of an ungracious termination of these restrictions. Indeed, were the question reduced to this alternative, either repeal this law at once, or abrogate it at the termination of five years, he would not hesitate to say, let the repeal be forthwith, and let the Church of England have the grace of so prompt a concession, and the Dissenters the full benefit of it.&#x2014;Having thus disposed of three of the causes pointed out, two more only remained for him to allude to. One was that of the noble lord, which asked for a simple and unqualified repeal; and the other that of his right hon. friend (Mr. S. Bourne), which would accompany the repeal by a declaration, in the place of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0604"/>
<col>1193</col>
security enjoined by the Sacramental Test. After the best consideration he could give these several propositions, he thought the safer course, and that most likely to preserve harmony between all parties, would be the adoption of something like the last recommendation. Whatever views were taken of the abstract principle, the wisest and best course would, he was convinced, be to come to such a final arrangement, as while it should not affect the fair and conscientious scruples of the Dissenters, would give a reasonable proof to the Church of England, that in the repeal of these long-established tests, which were considered as a much-valued security, the legislature thought fit to require, that a recorded opinion should be given, in the form of a Declaration, for the security of the predominancy of the Established Church. With this view he thought it only fair, that the committee should be instructed to introduce a declaration to the effect he had alluded to, to be taken as a substitute for the Sacramental Test, by the parties who were now liable to take it. If the House recognised that principle, he was prepared with a form of Declaration, which he trusted would be received with general assent. They had already sufficiently discussed whether it should be an oath, or merely a declaration. To propose an oath would be perhaps to arouse again the disstrust of the Dissenters, and subject them to an inconvenience which he thought could not follow the imposition of a declaration; and particularly when they looked at such an affirmation as interwoven with the principle of the constitution. The noble lord had said, that there ought to be no declaration which required any renunciation of religious feeling&#x2014;so said he. The noble lord had said, that there ought to be no declaration which required the expression of any religious feeling&#x2014;so said he Indeed, upon the whole view of the case, he preferred a solemn affirmation to an oath, because it was less calculated to arouse the jealousy of one party, and was equally operative as a security to the other. He should be ready to discuss the terms of the Declaration which he had himself prepared when in committee. It entered more into detail than that of his right hon. friend. He agreed with his right hon. friend, in thinking that, they had a right to expect the introduction of some declaration into the bill. If a modification be to be made of
<col>1194</col>
the laws affecting the Dissenters, such modification should be coupled with some measure of security for the established religion. The one which he now proposed exactly corresponded with that in the preamble of the bill brought forward by Mr. Grattan, and which was afterwards introduced by Mr. Plunkett. It recites that,&#x2014;" Whereas the Protestant Episcopal Church of England and Ireland, and the doctrine, discipline, and government, thereof, and likewise the Protestant Church of Scotland, and the doctrine, discipline, and government, thereof, are established permanently and inviolably." The declaration which then follows is similar to that which he (Mr. Peel) would propose as a substitute for the Sacramental Test. After adopting the preamble to the bill of Mr. Grattan, he proposed to introduce a declaration to the following effect: "And be it enacted, that all persons who shall hereafter be elected, or chosen to fill the office of mayor, alderman, or magistrate, or to fill any office of emolument and trust in any city or town corporate in England or Wales, shall, previous to his admission, make and subscribe the following Declaration:&#x2014;'I, A. B., do solemnly declare, that I will never exert any power nor any influence which I may possess by virtue of my office, to injure or subvert the Protestant church, by law established in these realms, or to disturb it in the possession of those rights and privileges to which it is by law entitled." That was the whole of the Declaration which he would propose to introduce. As he had begun to read the provision which he was desirous to see amalgamated with the bill, he might as well proceed through the entire of it. It went on to provide as follows:&#x2014;"And be it enacted, that the said Declaration shall be made and subscribed in the presence of the persons who by the present charters and usages of cities and towns corporate administer the oath to Dissenters on entering into office there; and that in counties corporate such Declaration shall be made and subscribed in the presence of two justices of the peace;&#x2014;and be it further enacted, that where any person shall omit, on being chosen or nominated to said office, to subscribe such Declaration, such election and nomination, and all the acts of such officer, are hereby declared null and void." He did not deem it necessary to attach any penalty to the omis-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0605"/>
<col>1195</col>
sion, further than rendering the election and the subsequent acts void. And here he had to encounter a difficulty respecting the officer appointed by the Crown. The difficulty was, to point out the particular offices under the Crown in which this Declaration should be taken. If every subordinate officer in the employment of the Crown, who was at present liable to be called upon to take the Sacramental Test, should be required to subscribe this Declaration, the provision would only throw ridicule upon the whole proceeding [hear]. To point out, then, the officers who should make the Declaration, and the officers who should be excepted, was the difficulty which he had to overcome. That difficulty, he imagined, might be obviated by some such regulation as this&#x2014;"Be it enacted that it may be lawful for his majesty to require of all persons who shall be appointed to civil offices of trust, or who shall hold commissions under his majesty's government, and by whom, according to the present law, the Sacramental Test is ordered to be taken" [this, it would be seen, did not affect the Presbyterian Dissenters of Ireland, or the members of the church of Scotland], "to make and subscribe the Declaration above-mentioned, preceding the admission of such persons to offices of civil trust, under such regulations, respecting the time and manner of subscribing such Declaration, as his majesty may be pleased to appoint." That provision on this subject, the House would see, would enable the Crown to point out the offices in which such Declaration would be considered necessary.&#x2014;Whatever part he might have taken in the discussion of this subject on a preceding night&#x2014;however he might have then resisted the proposition of the noble lord&#x2014;now, after what had taken place, he did not yield to the noble lord in his anxiety to see this question settled in the course of the present session, satisfactorily, and for ever. He entertained a hope that the provision which he had proposed, and which appeared to him so perfectly reasonable, would not be rejected by the noble lord or by any of the persons who advocated the claims of the Dissenters. It was impossible for him unequivocally to pledge other persons; but, if this provision should be adopted, he entertained the confident expectation, that the present session would not expire without an arrangement of a satisfactory and permanent nature being effected, with regard to the
<col>1196</col>
laws affecting the Dissenters. On each side of this, as of every other question, they could only arrive at a satisfactory arrangement by mutual concession. Let it be recollected that the laws which they were desirous to repeal had been mitigated, in a great degree, by the Annual Indemnity bill. The principle of those laws, as they stand, recognizes conformity to the Church of England as the only qualification for admission to corporate and civil offices. He and those who thought with him were prepared to give up that principle,&#x2014;they were prepared to declare that, without any reference to religious opinions, Protestant Dissenters shall be eligible to the above offices, provided they give security, by subscribing the Declaration which he had proposed, for the maintenance of the rights and privileges of the Established Church. If he understood the noble lord rightly on the first night of this discussion, the noble lord had spoken of the injustice inflicted on the Dissenters by the existing laws. The existence of that injustice pleaded strongly in favour of the adoption of the provision now proposed by him. If the Dissenters were sufferers under the present laws as they stood, that was a powerful reason why the advantages intended by the bill should not be rejected by them, because they were called upon to give, for the concessions thus afforded to them, a security similar to that which the principle of the existing law gave to the Church of England. The Church of England, in his opinion, had a right to demand from the Dissenters a satisfactory declaration, that none of the offices or powers of which they might become possessed should, under any circumstances, be used to injure the establishment, or to disturb it in the possession of its just privileges. The noble lord had stated his objections to any provision beyond that of simple repeal, and he had founded them principally upon the opinion which he entertained of the permanence of the Church Establishment, and which induced him to consider it unnecessary to connect any security with the measure of simple repeal. He would not now enter into the discussion, but he could not avoid expressing his opinion that the noble lord had failed to prove the truth of his position. In arguing the question, the noble lord was not warranted in appealing to America and to other countries, where there exist no established churches. It might be very true that no tests or securi-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0606"/>
<col>1197</col>
ties were required for the maintenance of established churches in such countries; but, according to the experience of this country for centuries, it was well known that religious feelings entered into secular affairs, and influenced the conduct of men. The experience of this country had shown that the Established Church had been always recognized as an essential portion of the constitution of the country, and strong measures had therefore been adopted to maintain unimpaired its rights and privileges. He would in that House take it for granted that the Established Church was an essential part of the constitution of the country. "Non meus hic sermo." In the bills which had been advocated by hon. gentlemen opposite, for the relief of the Roman Catholics, such an acknowledgment was made with a view to procure the assent of all parties. It was expressly made in the bill of the late Mr. Grattan. That bill set out by stating, that the removal of the disqualifications under which the Roman Catholics laboured would tend to promote the interest of the Established Church, and to strengthen our free constitution, of which that Church was an "essential part." He was sure that, upon that point there was no difference of opinion in that House. Maintaining, then, that the Established Church formed an essential part of the constitution, he conceived that the House should not agree to the measure under discussion, until they had maturely weighed the amount of security to which that Church was unquestionably entitled. He was glad to see that, during the discussion, full justice had been done to the temperate course adopted by the Church of England respecting this question. That Church had shown that it confided in the wisdom and justice of parliament, as to the measures of security which ought to be adopted for the preservation of its privileges and immunities. It was remarked by the noble lord, and by other hon. members, on the first night of this discussion, that as the Dissenters had for thirty-seven years remained tranquil, without presenting a petition for the recovery of their rights, their application on the present occasion was entitled to the particular consideration of the House. If that silence and acquiescence on their part justly entitled them to that consideration, he would say that the course pursued by the Church of England gave them also peculiar
<col>1198</col>
claims to the consideration and attention of parliament. Upon that point he trusted there would be but one feeling. They were about to repeal laws which had been long considered as the bulwarks of the Church of England, and it was impossible to deny that a strong opinion existed throughout the country favourable to the maintenance of those laws. They were about to give the Dissenters admission to office, and he hoped the measure would be carried, not by a majority, for it would be more satisfactory that their votes should be unanimous on this occasion. But if it should be necessary to have the sense of the House declared, he trusted there would be an overpowering majority against the provision of simple repeal, and in support of the bill accompanied with the Declaration which he had proposed. If the bill should be so altered, he entertained the most confident expectation of its ultimate success, and that before the termination of the session there would be a permanent settlement of the question. Whatever part he might have taken on former occasions, he could assure the noble lord and the House, that it was his anxious wish to see that desirable arrangement satisfactorily effected.</membercontribution></p>

He was ready to adopt the Declaration proposed, and more if it were required; but he must first be satisfied that it was necessary to the security of the Church of England. What the House had now to decide was, whether any instruction should be given to the committee to impose any such declaration as the right hon. gentleman had moved. Now, he would ask any hon. member whether the security of the Church of England was not greater at that moment than at any antecedent period since these acts had been passed? The Church had received all the safeguards it could possess, by the solemn national compacts
<image src="S2V0018P0I0607"/>
<col>1199</col>
made at the Unions with Scotland and Ireland. His objection to the proposed Declaration was, that it was not meant to apply to any class but the Dissenters. Why should the members of the Church of England require this security? The members of the Church of Scotland required no test for the support of their establishment. With respect to the Roman Catholics, whose exclusion from office was the great object of the Test act, they would be effectually excluded after this bill was passed, as the great barrier would still remain against them&#x2014;that of the Oath of Supremacy. There were none but the Dissenters to whom this Declaration could apply. It would be manifestly, on the part of parliament and the Church of England, a distrust of that body which ought not to exist. If any declaration was required, it should be of a more moderate character than either of those proposed. Neither that House nor the House of Peers required, in defence of its rights and privileges, any such security. Why, then, should it be necessary for the Church? He did not believe that the Church of England required any such security; and he objected to it because it would, in effect, be a stigma cast on the whole body of Dissenters. He should be sorry to separate himself from the noble lord, whose bill was a great event in the history of religious freedom, even if the Declaration should constitute a part of it. The thanks of the Dissenters throughout the country were due for the ability with which the noble lord had conducted their case. For his own part, if he thought they would gain admission to office by either of the declarations proposed, he would not object to their being incorporated in the bill, however he might dislike them in principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01006"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, that when he had voted in the majority on this bill, he had not voted for the repeal of these acts, in the expectation that any declaration, oath, or security, whatever, would be required from the Dissenters. His reason for having no such expectation was, not that he did not feel as ardent a zeal for the maintenance of the Church of England as any man&#x2014;and he trusted that the great majority of those who had voted with him shared the same sentiments&#x2014;but that he diet not see the danger to be provided against. He did not believe that any real security had ever resulted to the Church from the existence of these acts;
<col>1200</col>
nor did he conceive from whence danger could arise to the Church, during the last eighty-three years. Though the terms "barrier" and "bulwark" had been applied to these acts by writers of the highest reputation, yet really they rather deserved the name of a net, which the larger fishes leaped over, while the smaller slipped through it, and only now and then a fish, called an alderman, was caught in its meshes. In his friendship for the Dissenters, however, he did not forget the respect due to honest prejudice. He did not desire to see any measure passed which would give a triumph to one party over the other. He objected to these securities, as they were called, because he believed them to be useless. He did not see how the circumstance of the member of a corporation having taken a Declaration, could give him more or less power to disturb the rights or possessions of the Church. For one, however, he was ready to agree to the Declaration, as it did not appear that any practical inconvenience was likely to follow it. He thought, also, that it was a great improvement, that the Declaration was not to be taken by every individual. Nothing could tend more to bring tests into contempt and ridicule, than their frequent and unnecessary repetition. Under these circumstances, he thought the noble lord would act unwisely if he separated those who were agreed on the main point, by refusing to consent to the instruction of his right hon. friend. The bill would still grant practical relief, and do away with the scandal of the present state of the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01007"><member>Lord Althorpe</member><membercontribution> also objected to the proposed Declaration. He was an advocate for simple repeal, unaccompanied by any conditions, and would object to adding any new oaths or declarations to those prescribed to be taken by the people of this country. They were in this instance unnecessary, and afforded no security whatever to the Church. After, however, the pledge given by the right hon. gentleman, he should be sorry to oppose his proposition; and he preferred the Declaration introduced by the right hon. gentleman, to the other, for this reason, that it was simple and more moderate. He would, however, have opposed this provision, if it had been accompanied by any penalty similar to that now incurred by the omission of the Sacramental Test; for, in that case, in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0608"/>
<col>1201</col>
passing a bill for the relief of the Dissenters, they would be actually imposing a bill of pains and penalties on the people of England. It appeared, however, that the right hon. gentleman did not propose the infliction of any penalty further than the deprivation of office; and, with respect to the officers under the Crown, he left it at the option of government to require it of such persons and at such times as it might think fit. With such a discretionary power vested in the government, he trusted that this Declaration would be allowed to fall into disuse, but if a penalty were attached to the omission of the Declaration, it would never be allowed to remain a dead letter. Feeling, after the speech of the right hon. Secretary, that, with the modification to which he had alluded, the object of the Dissenters would be attained, he would not offer any opposition to the proposition. It gave him great pleasure to congratulate his noble friend on the success of his efforts. His name would go down to posterity revered and honoured as the mover of this salutary measure&#x2014;a measure which was calculated to wipe away one of the foulest blots that ever stained the history of this country&#x2014;a measure, which would have the effect of tranquillizing the minds and conciliating the affections of a large and valuable body of people. Although he was against the adoption of any Declaration whatsoever in cases of this description, he would not, by any opposition, prevent the accomplishment of this desirable measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01008"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> said, that if he felt any wish unsatisfied with respect to this question, it was because any declaration was called for. If the proposition of his noble friend had been acceded to in its original form, he should have considered it the greatest possible triumph of liberal principles and opinions. But, when he was told by high authority, that in pursuing the course recommended by the right hon. Secretary, they might indulge in the hope of final success, he was ready to unite his recommendation with that of others to the noble lord, in order to induce him to agree to the proposition which had been made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01009"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> said, he had come down to the House on a former occasion as on the present, to enter on a full exposition of the great principles of Protest ant dissent, and to vindicate them from every
<col>1202</col>
attack, whether covered or undisguised. But the course at length tardily taken by his majesty's government not only rendered such a proceeding on his part unnecessary, but, perhaps, for the present at least, inexpedient. For himself, he deprecated all tests, whatever form or name they assumed; yet as the Declaration proposed was urged as a compliment to the prejudices of the Church, he would not deny a request which might gratify afflicted pride, provided it made no inroad on the great principles of non-conformity; and in this he was sure he spoke the sentiments of the entire dissenting community. For himself, he was more content than gratified; yet as it was his honour to owe his seat in that House, mainly to the disinterested exertions of an intelligent and enlightened body of Dissenters, he should defer his own sentiments to theirs, and regulate his future conduct on this bill as should comport with the feelings of that body. But he, at the same time, earnestly hoped that nothing would arise to disturb a feeling of unanimity which, from whatever cause arising, could not fail to advance the great principles of civil and religious freedom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01010"><member>Mr. William Smith</member><membercontribution> likewise rose amid loud cries of "question." He observed, that he felt it would be ill taste in him to take up much of the time of the House, and he would therefore endeavour not to detain it beyond a few minutes; but when those who had known him long recollected that he had for a term of forty years been looking forward for what he now saw almost, as it were, within his grasp, and likewise within the grasp of thousands with whom he had been long and intimately connected, he trusted that they and the House would rather give him credit for not having sooner obtruded himself on their notice, than for an unfair wish to utter a few words, which, he was happy to say, would be very much in unison with what had fallen that evening from the hon. members who had preceded him. In the first place, he was willing to treat with the respect due to them honest and ancient prejudices; and he would also say, when he saw those prejudices wearing away day after day,&#x2014;whether in consequence of the march of intellect or from what other cause&#x2014;he thought that what still remained of those ancient prejudices did not require much to be sacrificed to them, and he could not but
<image src="S2V0018P0I0609"/>
<col>1203</col>
be persuaded, that if his noble friend would go on for some years longer, those prejudices would all vanish,&#x2014;they would be entirely obliterated,&#x2014;and an unqualified measure would be conceded, free from any declaration, and without any clause or provision being substituted in its room. Such a measure, he believed, would be agreed to with as much unanimity as appeared to be given in the present instance to a proposition for that which he considered not to be any security whatever, and which he believed would, a few years hence, be placed in exactly the same state, and would be found to be as unnecessary as the existing law was. He was, however, ready to allow for any prejudice which existed on the present occasion; and, so far as he was concerned, he would give way to that prejudice, rather than incur the risk of bringing about any disappointment which might arise elsewhere, or which might have the effect of forcing gentlemen in that House to take a course which might be, in some degree, opposed to their wishes. He hoped, however, that gentlemen would allow him, for a short time, to point out why those securities&#x2014;or, more properly speaking, those proposed securities&#x2014;where wholly and utterly useless. He would ask gentlemen, for a moment, to state in what they considered the security of the Church of England to consist? Was it not, he would demand, in the affection of a very large majority of the English people? He firmly believed that a very large majority of the English people was attached, strongly attached, to the Church of England. And while that attachment remained, the Church was no more in danger from the minority, that if that minority were of the same opinion with the larger number. Still, however, he thought the Established Church would be far more secure when those obnoxious acts were done away, than it even was now. For what was the effect of those laws but to keep up a feeling of irritation in the minds of many thousand persons in this country, who, if they did not think themselves oppressed by those measures,&#x2014;if they did not feel that they were hardly treated by persons who differed from them in religious opinion,&#x2014;would hardly bestow a thought on the subject, of the Established Church? Where could those apprehended dangers arise but within the walls of parliament? But
<col>1204</col>
never had the friends of the Dissenters in the House of Commons hinted at, much less proposed, any measure that could injure, or had a tendency to subvert, the Establishment. If he had attempted any thing of the kind, he should only have manifested his own extravagance and folly. He had not, on this occasion, objected to any words proposed in either declaration, because he knew of no form of words so definite and specific, as not to be likely to affect the minds and feelings of persons of a different religious persuasion, for whom that form was intended. If, at any future period, the Dissenters were accused of any thing like duplicity, should they object to, or desire to have altered, a single phrase in the Declaration, the just answer would be, that, so far from violating the sort of security included in this measure, they were only doing that which they had an undoubted right to do. The proposition to do away with those acts on such a security as the right hon. Secretary had proposed was, in his own opinion, not the most eligible mode of proceeding. He believed there were thousands of persons now in England on whom these prejudices operated in such a degree as would lead them to suppose, that, in at all relieving the Dissenters, parliament was doing away with the great bulwarks of the Church. Those prejudices might remain for some time longer; they might induce gentlemen to stand up in that House to oppose the slightest alteration in those laws; but they would ultimately be obliterated. He had observed, within a very short period, that a measure then in progress through the House, for the commutation of tithes, was stigmatized as calculated to inflict a gross injury on the Church of England; and such appeared to be the feeling of a large body of clergymen. This showed the feeling which existed on every question at all connected with the Church, and proved what an interpretation was put on any measure that appeared, in the slightest degree, to interfere with it.&#x2014;The right hon. Secretary had said, that one reason for proposing this Declaration was, to make the settlement final. Now, in his view of the case, it could not be considered final. If the proposition of his noble friend for the total and unqualified repeal of those acts was agreed to, that would afford a far better chance of the final settlement of the difference between the two parties,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0610"/>
<col>1205</col>
than could be effected by any declaration whatsoever; and he thought; so, because it was on the ground of the existence of certain prejudices, which were dying away, that this supposed security was called for; and when those prejudices had died away, a final settlement of differences would, in truth and in fact, take place, and with it an utter forgetfulness of those distinctions which had too long continued; because any test or declaration directed against the Dissenters operated, in point of fact, against the Church of England. Now, he thought the present attempt at security really presented no security at all,&#x2014;that, to use a phrase which he had heard (and it was a very pregnant one) in the course of this dispute, it was, with great solemnity, asking no security against no danger [hear.] This was what he felt; and he thought that there was no security whatever in the Declaration. He believed that at the present moment England was almost the only country in Europe where such qualifications were called for. Many papers had been laid before that House, which proved that liberal principles were cherished in many of the continental states; and he begged to call the attention of gentlemen to the treaty signed at Vienna by nearly all the plenipotentiaries of Europe, in 1815. In the articles annexed to the 8th article of that treaty was the following:&#x2014;"Article 2. No innovation shall be made in the articles of this constitution, which secure equal protection and favour to every sect, and guarantee permission to all citizens, whatever their religious belief may be, to take employments and offices under the state." This was contained in the treaty concluded between the king of the Netherlands, Russia, England, Austria, and Prussia, on the 31st of May, 1815. Now, when he found that those states of Europe in which the Roman Catholic religion was established, had declared by solemn treaty, that no religious distinction should be suffered to exist; and when he recollected the words of lord Castlereagh, who was a party to that treaty, who had stated that there was not a more simple point on which the negociators of that time were agreed than this,&#x2014;when he found that this liberal principle pervaded the whole of their proceedings,&#x2014;when he recollected these things, he felt it to be a great disgrace that England should be the last to keep up such unjust distinctions. He did therefore sincerely
<col>1206</col>
rejoice in the success with which the proposition of his noble friend was likely to meet, because it would wipe away nearly&#x2014;and he wished it would wipe away entirely,&#x2014;that blot and disgrace which had so long existed on the character of England. Now he would ask of those gentlemen who said that the Church of England stood in need of some security, did not that church pride itself on being founded on the principles of the Christian religion, more truly and more purely than any other church in Europe? If that were the case, what did it want security for? Was not that church in possession of great connexions,&#x2014;of royal, noble connexions? was she not in possession of an immense revenue, of resources the most extensive? If then with numbers, with power, with wealth, she was not safe against the assaults of persons like the Dissenters who had no bond amongst them, except the common bond which united them against injury, would not the Church of England when that injury was removed and forgotten, be placed in a better situation? What would she then have to fear? She had wealth, number, affection, power; add to these a disposition to conciliate those who had been too long depressed, and all apprehension for her safety must vanish. For these reasons, thinking that the security was not wanted,&#x2014;thinking, if it was of no use, that it had better be dispensed with&#x2014;and thinking that those prejudices which had so long existed were dying away, and would in a few years be wholly extinct&#x2014;he felt that it would have been better if the proposition of his noble friend uncoupled with any restriction, had been suffered to pass. But, for one, he would gladly receive what might be given by the House; particularly when he took into consideration the opinion of the right hon. Secretary that this measure would stand a better chance in another place with this provision than it would do without it. He did, therefore, consent to the measure, on the part of those who had a good claim for that which they demanded; but at the same time, protesting against the alleged necessity of security, and contending that the Dissenters had a right to ask for the repeal of those acts without any condition whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01011"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> begged leave to remind the right hon. Secretary, that he had, on a former occasion, declared that, at the time when the bill was about going
<image src="S2V0018P0I0611"/>
<col>1207</col>
into a committee, he should be ready to listen to any proposition that might be made on the subject, and that if these acts could be repealed satisfactorily to the Church, it would be doubly satisfactory to him. Of that opinion he still remained; and he rejoiced to think, following the general impression of the House, that what he wished to effect might be done satisfactorily to the Dissenters, and not unsatisfactorily to the Church. He had listened with pleasure and attention to all that had passed, particularly to what had fallen from the right hon. Secretary and the right hon. gentleman (Mr. S. Bourne). He thought it was his duty to acquiesce in the proposition of the right hon. Secretary, although that of the right hon. gentleman came, perhaps, nearer to his own feelings. But, though that was the case, the declaration proposed by him had not the advantage of that part of the declaration of the right hon. Secretary, which would, he hoped, prove satisfactory to those who took care of the interests of the Church. That point he could not overlook in introducing this bill. He wished the measure not to be in any degree forced and compulsory: he was desirous that it should pass on free and willing grounds. He therefore had no hesitation in going into the committee with the instruction that the provision proposed by the right hon. Secretary should be referred to it. He wished that provision to be entertained, rather than any other. He would, however, guard himself from adopting any of the specific words or phrases which the right hon. Secretary might have introduced. With respect to the Declaration, he would say, that there unquestionably was something in the practice which was calculated to raise some doubt in the minds of the Dissenters; but he indulged in the hope of its being removed by conciliatory conferences with respect to the form of the words proposed, rather than by angry discussion and debate. Therefore his wish was, that in the first instance the committee should adopt the proposition of the right hon. Secretary wholly and entirely; and when the bill was printed, it could be considered as a perfectly open question: This appeared to him to be the course more likely to obtain the assent of all parties than any other he could point out. This measure was not to be considered as operating solely on Dissenters. If it was extended to Scotland,
<col>1208</col>
as he presumed it would be, the Declaration would be taken by members of the Established Church in that kingdom, who would be there viewed in the character of Dissenters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01012"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> said, the Declaration he had proposed was applicable to none, except those who were about to fill offices.

<p id="S2V0018P0-01013">The Speaker then left the chair, and the House went into a committee, Mr. R. Gordon in the chair.</p>

<section>
<title>PASSENGERS' REGULATION BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01016">On the motion, that this bill be read a second time,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01017"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> said, that when he first heard of this bill, he supposed that if a few comforts were added to the passengers while on board the vessels, all the objections to the present system would be obviated; but, on reading the papers laid before the House, he found that the objections did not relate solely to inconveniences of the voyage, but to the principle on which voluntary emigration was now conducted. The complaints of the colonists against this principle resolved themselves into two points; first, that the emigrants were paupers; secondly, that they were chosen from the disaffected classes. Every page of this correspondence contained allegations of this nature. Now, the reasons assigned by the colonists, why unlimited emigration ought not to be thus allowed, were the very reasons which were urged by English and Irish gentlemen before the committees of 1824, 1825, and the committee of last year, and by the Roman Catholic priests, in order to prove that emigration ought to be encouraged as much as possible. The former object to receiving paupers and persons from disaffected districts, and the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0612"/>
<col>1209</col>
latter say, that the paupers are the very persons who ought to be encouraged to emigrate; and further, that it would be wise to thin the population in the most disaffected districts by emigration [The hon. member here read portions of the evidence before various committees, in support of this position]. Here, then, were two conflicting and absolutely contradictory opinions. The colonists refuse to take the disaffected paupers of Ireland, and the English and Irish gentlemen say that these are the very persons who ought to emigrate. They were at issue upon a leading point, and on this point the House had to judge. It was absolutely necessary that government should decide one way or the other; that they should either check the emigration of paupers and disaffected persons, or fall into the views of the Irish proprietors; or, in a modified way, into the view of the right hon. member for Newcastle, and bear a part of the expense. He believed there were causes operating which would prevent the government from attempting to check the tide of emigration, even if they were inclined to do so; and if this bill were intended as a check to voluntary emigration, which he hoped it was not, it was his opinion that it would be found impossible to carry it into effect. He did not enter into the views of the right hon. member for Newcastle, and wish that 20<i>l.</i> a-head should be given to the emigrants; but then he contended, that government ought to lend their aid to locating the emigrants on their landing. It appeared from this correspondence that 15<i>s</i>.&#x2014;let it be taken at 20<i>s</i>.&#x2014;a-head, placed in the hands of the colonial government, would remove the greater part of the distress complained of by the colonists on the landing of the emigrants. This House ought not to stand idly by, and contribute nothing on this subject but reports. And now a word or two as to the bill itself. He really thought that so many alterations were necessary in it, that they could only be satisfactorily made in a committee up-stairs. It had been stated, that in consequence of the crowded state of these vessels, the want of food and of water, and the dirt, infectious diseases had been generated, which destroyed a considerable portion of the crews, and of the population of the towns in which they landed. Now, with regard to the ship "James," in which it had been said that the typhus fever had been generated, the
<col>1210</col>
allegation of one of the governors was a complete answer to that of the other governor, who, in utter ignorance of the typhus fever, said it had been generated on board that vessel. He spoke on the authority of the best physicians, when he said that the typhus fever could no more be generated than the scarlet fever, the small-pox, or any other of those diseases which were called contagious. When the House recollected how long the typhus fever had prevailed in Ireland, there was no difficulty in finding out how it happened that it raged on board a vessel filled with poor and destitute Irish people. He had been told by the right hon. member for Waterford, that when this vessel sailed, the typhus fever prevailed so universally, in that part of Ireland, that the funds of a charitable institution, whose object was to relieve persons afflicted with this disease, were totally exhausted. Unless the right hon. gentleman was disposed to grant a committee up-stairs, before which all parties interested, and especially the Irish shipowners, might be heard, he must withhold his support to the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01018"><member>Mr. V. Stuart</member><membercontribution> said, it appeared to him that this bill merely consisted of regulations which secured sufficient space for the passengers during the voyage; he could not, therefore, understand by what party, or on what ground, so useful a measure was to be opposed. As to the Irish shipowners, if they meant to do what was right, they could have no objection to do it under an act of parliament, and if they did not, then the sooner they were made to do it the better. In his opinion the bill encouraged rather than retarded emigration, and he therefore should support it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01019"><member>Mr. Robinson</member><membercontribution> perfectly agreed with the hon. member for Waterford, who in a few words, had placed the subject in the right point of view. If the hon. member opposite would carefully examine the information which had been received from the different governors&#x2014;information which put speculation at defiance&#x2014;he would find that a case had been made out so strong as to warrant the House in restoring the provisions of a bill which had unfortunately been repealed a year or two ago. He could not understand why the hon. member, in arguing against the provisions of this bill, should have gone into the great question of emancipation. The bill certainly had a bearing on that question; but the hon. member had argued as if it
<image src="S2V0018P0I0613"/>
<col>1211</col>
included the whole of that question, The present state of the Passengers' law was, in his opinion, monstrous, and a disgrace to the country. He decidedly objected to the proposition for going into a committee above stairs: the season for the departure of ships with emigrants was approaching, and, unless some act was passed, we should have a repetition of the same horrors in the present year which had been in the last so justly complained of.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01020"><member>Mr. J. Grattan</member><membercontribution> considered the present measure to be one designed more for the benefit of the colonies, than for the advantage either of England or Ireland. In his opinion it was calculated to impede emigration rather than to promote it. He was desirous of affording every facility to the purposes of free emigration. The inspection of the vessels was a measure to which he had no objection, but he did not think it necessary to sanction a bill imposing such restrictions as the present. At all events, it was desirable to go into a committee on the bill; as it certainly was one which should not be hastily adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01021"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to call the attention of the House to the real question before it. He was not disposed to enter into a discussion upon the general question of emigration: that was a subject which would require a more extended line of argument than hon. members would be inclined to listen to at so late a period of the evening. He could not agree that the question of emigration was so extremely simple, that the House would be justified in saying, "if it be right to encourage emigration, then it is unnecessary to take any care of the manner in which the parties emigrating are transported to the country of their destination.' The hon. member for Bridport had spoken of those parties as if they had no claim upon the consideration of the country in which they had been born, and in which they had devoted many years of their lives to labour, until peculiar circumstances in the condition of that country rendered their further services superfluous or inapplicable. Under such circumstances he could not consent to speak of these people&#x2014;the most helpless and uninformed of the community&#x2014;as of a mere commodity which was the subject of export from one locality to another. It had surprised him to hear the hon. member lay down those doctrines of political philosophy and medical science which he had brought
<col>1212</col>
forward, and especially to hear him argue upon them as upon principles to which no person could object. The hon. member's argument amounted to this&#x2014;that where typhus had broken out on board the emigration ships, that malady had not arisen out of any crowded or unclean state of the vessel, but necessarily proceeded from the emigrants themselves having been put on board in a state of disease. This might be a discovery made by the hon. member, but certainly it was directly contrary to the opinions of all those who had paid the most attention to such subjects. But how did the facts appear from the reports upon the table? The letters from New Brunswick distinctly attributed the disease in the ships which had reached that port to the crowded state of the vessels themselves, and to the entire want of order and cleanliness which pervaded their arrangements. The authority of this correspondence could not be questioned; but the hon. member had garbled it, in order to make it serve his own peculiar theory. Where the letters spoke of a particular parcel of emigrants as the most miserable and squalid on their arrival that the writer had ever beheld, the hon. member at once jumped to the inference, that the people must necessarily have been in that state when they embarked from Europe: now, it was at least as likely, and certainly better proved, that they had fallen into this condition in the course of the passage. The hon. member said, that typhus had broken out in the "James," almost as extensively as in any; and yet, certainly, in that case, from the number of persons on board, it was evident that there had been no crowding of passengers. But the hon. gentleman forgot that this ship was shewn to have been in total want of provisions, a circumstance just as likely to produce serious disease as too great a confinement in point of space. It was needless, however, to go into detail upon the state of particular ships, when the writer in this correspondence, a captain in the navy, who had been employed in the preventive Slave service on the coast of Africa, declared that the condition of many vessels which he had seen arrive at Newfoundland with emigrants beggared all the descriptions of the state of the captured slave-ships, even under the accumulated miseries belonging to the existing system of contraband trade. It was, then, the duty of ministers, and their
<image src="S2V0018P0I0614"/>
<col>1213</col>
imperative duty, to call upon parliament for power to put a stop to these enormities; and, with his best exertions, even in the teeth of science and philosophy, he would oppose the proposition for going into a committee, which would allow the opportunity of their perpetration during another season. He protested that, if the committee were carried, he would himself recommend all the colonies to pass bills, in their own defence, for general embarkation; for we had no right to inundate them with such a population as they were receiving under the existing system. Honourable gentlemen spoke of the Passenger's act, as being calculated to check the flow of voluntary emigration; but he was certain that nothing could be more likely to prevent voluntary emigration than the accounts which parties now received of the miserable fate of those who had gone before them. He agreed entirely that it was the duty of government towards emigrants to see that they were not shipped in any case without a competent supply of food and water. The food might be of the very commonest description, but a proper quantity of it they should have. And the water should be of a drinkable quality, shipped in a condition fit for human creatures; and not in old casks which had recently contained molasses or salt hides, which had been the case in more than one instance. It was too much to talk of there being no necessity for these regulations. Even in the time of the Slave-trade there had been a law regulating the number of slaves by the tonnage upon the middle passage; and that which we had thought it right to do for the negroes of Africa ought we to refuse to do for our own countrymen? Honourable gentlemen talked of its being hard that ships should be put to the trouble of furnishing an account of every passenger that they carried out. Why, they were compelled to furnish an account of the smallest parcel that they took out, and that which they did for a bale of goods, they might surely well make shift to do for a living man. He wished to throw as little difficulty in the way of the shipping trade as possible; but he would insist upon having such a quantity of provision and water always on board, as should guarantee the emigrants from famine in case of a protracted passage; and the state of the vessels as to numbers should be such as was conducive to the health
<col>1214</col>
and common safety of the human beings who were on board of them. With these views he resisted the appointment of the committee up-stairs, and should press his own measure as rapidly as the forms of the House would allow him to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01022"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, he was surprised to find the professed advocate of free trade supporting a bill like that before the House. Honourable gentlemen seemed to forget that the object of emigration was, not to send out of the country the choicer portion of its inhabitants, but to provide for those who were in a state of excessive poverty, and had no means of obtaining employment. The whole of the provisions of the Passengers' acts had been calculated to do nothing but mischief, and the trade of carrying emigrants must have stopped if they had not been evaded. The stores required to be put on board were perfectly unsuited to the habits of the persons who were to use them. The Irish were made sick by the diet of beef ' and pudding; and the right hon. gentleman talked of providing biscuit on board. Who wanted biscuit? For the Scotch he would answer, that oatmeal and water was all that was necessary. The business of emigration had gone on very well without any restrictions until the year 1817, and then, because one or two cases of abuse arose, the trade was cramped with laws which, if they had not been evaded, would have put an end to it entirely. He could not see the consistency of this conduct on the part of the right hon. gentleman, the advocate of the principles of free trade. It was an odd change in the tactics of the right hon. gentleman; but it was not quite his first, and he went on wavering. He had begun well; now he was going on not quite so well; and it was difficult to say where he would land at last. For himself, he was against the bill altogether. He would have no interference whatever with the Irish who might wish to emigrate. Every arrangement by legislation would be only injurious to them. He trusted, therefore, that the House would reject the measure altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01023"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> said, he considered the present bill as an innovation on the freedom of trade. For fifty years the system of emigration had been going on without any legislative interference; and no evils had arisen from the want of such regulations as the present. He thought it was unfair
<image src="S2V0018P0I0615"/>
<col>1215</col>
for government to act in so important a matter on the representations of individual cases, given by interested parties. Much stress had been laid on two cases of typhus fever which had been taken out from Waterford to one of our colonies. Now it happened, that the whole of the last summer typhus had prevailed to a great extent at Waterford, and it could not be a matter of surprise that two vessels should have departed from it with cases of fever on board; but what he feared was, that in the representations thus made, no inquiries had been made into the circumstances of the vessels when they sailed from port; and he thought that the measure before the House should be delayed until an opportunity should be given for obtaining full information on the subject. He thought that, if this bill was converted into a check, which he believed it would be, to emigration, every Irish person whose emigration it would hinder should be maintained in England or Scotland, If the House intended to go to the expense of transferring the poor to the colonies at a cost to the country of 30<i>l.</i> per man, some regulations of this kind might be enforced; but voluntary emigration should be allowed to take its own course. The emigrants ought to be permitted to make the best provision for their voyage without being subject to any government regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01024"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, he could easily explain the difference of opinion between himself and the right hon. baronet on this subject. If the right hon. bart. thought that the colonies would gladly receive the forced population of Ireland, which some gentlemen of that country encouraged for the purpose of raising their rents, if he thought that redundant population, no matter how wretched and destitute in its condition, would be gladly received on their arrival in the colonies, he was right in opposing any regulations as to the mode of their transfer from the country. If the right hon. baronet thought that every man ejected from his small farm and miserable hut, by the system of law now in force in Ireland, was to be willingly received, the moment he reached the shores of our colonies, he might be right in opposing any measure which, in his opinion, would tend to restrict emigration; but the right hon. baronet was wrong in assuming that such would be the case. The whole of the information laid before the committee on emigration proved that the colonists had no
<col>1216</col>
disposition to receive all who went from this country as emigrants. The right hon. baronet knew full well the circumstances under which large bodies of the people emigrated from Ireland, that they had no option, but were obliged to resort to emigration as a last resource. But, would not the evils of their condition be multiplied on their arrival in the colonies without any preparation, or any provision being made for their employment or subsistence? Was it to be supposed that on their arrival they were to find, as if by miracle, a provision ready for them? Such a doctrine would be most absurd, and if acted upon would have the effect of increasing a hundred fold the evils which the emigrants had endeavoured to avoid by removing from their native country. He for one must ever protest against the doctrine, that the immediate effect of indiscriminate emigration was to be the reception of the emigrants by the colonists. The very reverse was already proved in too many cases. America had legislated on the subject, and had come to the decision not to receive the crowds thrown off from the forced population of Ireland, where the increase was directly encouraged, in order to secure occupants for the small parcels of land into which gentlemen divided their estates in that country, for the purpose of obtaining a larger rental. If, then, America would not receive them, was it not hard that those which she refused should be thrown on the colonies? Could any thing be more unjust than that those colonies should be as it were called upon to provide for a large portion of the population of this country, who were not in a condition to offer any equivalent in the way of useful service for the subsistence which they thus required? The right hon. baronet had talked of the system of sending out emigrants at the public expense, and without being able to support his argument by the testimony of a single witness of character, still contended, that emigrants so sent out would not be able to defray the expense of their outfit, or rather he rested satisfied by denying, without any evidence, that which was supported by the testimony of so many competent witnesses. Until the right hon. baronet could support that denial by the evidence of competent witnesses, he must, in his turn, deny the justice of the right hon. baronet's conclusion.&#x2014;He would also deny that the sending out emigrants in the way which he had proposed could
<image src="S2V0018P0I0616"/>
<col>1217</col>
be considered as an expense to the country; for to supply a man with an outfit and provisions, which he was to repay in a year or two, could not be considered an expense. He had better ground for his denial than the right hon. baronet; for no proof whatever had been offered on the other side. But, to come to the question more immediately before the House, he begged to deny that the regulations contained in the present bill were any infraction of the principles of free trade. What did those regulations propose? They made it imperative on the master of a ship, taking out emigrant passengers, to provide a sufficient quantity of water and proper food for the voyage. Were not these called for by the common dictates of humanity? Could any thing be more reasonable or humane, than that some such regulations should be enforced, for the benefit of those who, from their situation, could not be aware of the privations to which they might be exposed in a long voyage? He was astonished that hon. gentlemen were not ashamed to come down to that House, and object to regulations such as those proposed by the bill, on the ground that they were in violation of the principles of free trade. The right hon. baronet complained that government had acted on the representations of interested individuals. From whom could the government expect representations of this kind, and on whose testimony could they place reliance, if not on those of distinguished individuals, holding situations of great trust and responsibility? Was no attention to be paid to the official statements of such men as the governors of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, or Newfoundland? Yet all these had concurred: in their communications to government, as to the evils produced by large masses of emigrants going out without any preparation or provision. Sir James Kemp said, that such was the wretched and sickly condition of many of the parties that arrived from this country, that the hospital was soon filled with them, and that more extensive accommodation of that kind was found necessary. But such cases were not isolated. The whole of the colonies cried out against the system as it had been recently carried on; and there was scarcely a private letter which reached this country, which was not full of such representations, and which did not call for relief from the pressure of emigration so conducted. It would appear, also, that this system was
<col>1218</col>
not confined to England, for that we had inoculated our neighbours with a similar indifference to the manner in which emigration was conducted. From a letter which he had seen, it appeared that some time ago a ship, the "Helen Maria," of two hundred and forty tons, sailed from Amsterdam for America, with three hundred and eleven emigrants on board; a number which, it must be admitted, was more than could be sufficiently accommodated in a vessel of that size. After being a short time at sea, the vessel met with severe weather, and was dismasted. She afterwards got into Falmouth, where it was discovered that no attention had been paid to the situation of the passengers. The greatest want of cleanliness was perceived among them. On looking to the state of their provisions, it was found that their beef was good, but that the bread and water were both bad, and deficient in quantity. No doubt many instances could be adduced of vessels leaving our own ports, equally deficient in the quality and quantity of the provisions; and was the House to permit such cases to be of frequent occurrence, without making some regulations by which so many evils might be avoided? It was their duty to see that such regulations were enforced; and on these grounds he felt himself bound to support the present bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01025"><member>Mr. Stanley</member><membercontribution> admitted the great zeal and perseverance of his right hon. friend on the subject of emigration, and the readiness with which, in the course of his labours in the committee, he had attended to every humane suggestion that had been made. He was sorry, however, that he had on this occasion deviated so much from the question before the House, and mixed up a theoretical question with one; which was purely practical. With the opinions of his right hon. friend on the bill, he fully concurred. The right hon. baronet, and the hon. member for Montrose, had argued the question as if their only object was to get rid of the superabundant population, no matter how, but at the cheapest possible rate. The representations on which the government had acted were, he contended, such as they could not refuse to attend to; and all these had concurred in stating, that the colonies would not receive the miserable and almost unserviceable crowds who went out in search of employment. The consequence was, that some such measure as
<image src="S2V0018P0I0617"/>
<col>1219</col>
the present was necessary. The hon. member for Montrose had objected to the correspondence on which some of the details rested; but he would appeal to the whole House whether, if one twentieth part of that correspondence had reached the hon. member, they should ever have had an end of his comments upon it? The hon. member had set himself up as the apostle of free trade; but admitting his apostle-ship, he must dispute his doctrine, that in no case, and under no circumstances, were the principles of free trade to be departed from. The case before the House was one which called for the proposed regulations, and it would, he maintained, be doing great injustice to the colonists, as well as to the emigrants, if they were not adopted. The whole of the communications received on the subject proved that those regulations were necessary. He had voted for the repeal of the last bill, but he could not conscientiously withhold his support from this, or suffer another season of emigration to pass without having some regulations in force, which would prevent a recurrence of the mischiefs that had arisen from the want of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01026"><member>Mr. P. Thompson</member><membercontribution> contended, that his hon. friends did not oppose this billon the ground of particular restrictions. All they asked was, that it should go to a committee up-stairs, to inquire whether any restrictions were necessary, and if any thing could prove that the House was not the best place where such inquiry should be made, it would be the tone and temper in which the Secretary for the colonies had addressed the House upon it. He gave great credit to that right hon. gentleman for his principles of free trade, and wished him joy of his steady adherence to them. The maxim of the right hon. gentleman on this occasion seemed to be,
<quote>"&#x2014; Video meliora proboque,</quote>
<quote>Deteriora sequor."</quote>
The hon. member then proceeded to contend, that there was no analogy between the necessity of regulations in ships conveying slaves, and those now made for emigrants. The slave was forced to make the voyage, but the emigrant acted voluntarily, and could, beforehand, inspect the accommodations prepared for him. If it was thought necessary to legislate as to the quality of the emigrant's food in his voyage across the Atlantic, hon. members should look at the other side of the picture, and consider what a continuation of misery
<col>1220</col>
parties were exposed to who were prevented from emigration. The hon. gentleman then went on to contend that no case had yet been made out for the proposed regulations, and that they ought in the first instance to be submitted to the inquiries of a committee above stairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01027"><member>Mr. S. Worthy</member><membercontribution> said, he had been a member of the Emigration committee, and from all that had there appeared, there was no one who could doubt that some regulations were necessary, and more particularly as the season was now approaching when emigration would take place. He therefore would give his support to the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01028"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, that the only question was whether there ought to be a committee up stairs to examine further into the subject, or whether they should at once decide the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01029"><member>Sir J. Beresford</member><membercontribution> said, he had had frequent opportunities of conversing with governors and admirals stationed in the colonies, who all concurred in bearing testimony to the sufferings of the miserable emigrants whose necessities had driven them to seek shelter in a foreign country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BUENOS-AYRES AND BRAZIL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01031"><member>Lord Strangford,</member><membercontribution> seeing his noble friend the Secretary of State in his place, wished to solicit his attention to a matter of the utmost importance to the commercial interests of this country. He alluded to the fatal operation upon those interests, of that most absurd and mischievous warfare which had so long been permitted to subsist between the states of Buenos Ayres and Brazil. Some time ago his noble friend had given hopes to the merchants connected with the South American trade, that the influence of the British government would be used to put an end to the state of things under which the commerce of this country had so long suffered. He could not doubt of the zeal and earnestness with which that influence had been employed; but he feared that hitherto it had produced no effect in restoring peace, for at least one of the parties to that war continued to commit acts, in some instances of such atrocious barbarity against the persons of English merchants, as, he verily believed, were never equalled, unless by the deeds
<image src="S2V0018P0I0618"/>
<col>1221</col>
of the old Bucaniers. His noble friend would allow him to say, that whatever might be thought of the value of our relations with the New States in South America, he had lived long enough in those countries to be quite persuaded, that there was but one trade with them which was of the slightest real importance to this country,&#x2014;he meant the trade with Brazil. That trade was, at the present moment, completely suspended, owing to the state of insecurity and uncertainty growing out of this war of pillage and plunder. He happened to know that at that moment goods to the amount of 1,500,000<i>l.</i> sterling were ready to be shipped to Brazil; but which merchants did not dare to ship so long as this war continued; a war accompanied with circumstances extremely like those which were made a ground of very extreme measures indeed in another part of the world. He understood that there was a capital of 2,000,000<i>l.</i> locked up in Rio, which the merchants there could not export to this country, because the exchange was against them to the extent of from 24 to 28 percent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01032"><member>Earl Dudley</member><membercontribution> said, it was undoubtedly true, that war had been going on for a considerable time between Buenos Ayres and Brazil, which had been attended with great mischief to the commerce and navigation of his majesty's subjects. He could assure their lordships, however, that almost from the beginning of that war, and ever since he had the honour to hold office, no endeavour on our part had been omitted to produce peace, but on the contrary, efforts to obtain that object had been anxiously made with zeal and diligence, both by his majesty's ministers at home, and his envoys at Buenos Ayres and Rio. Hitherto, unfortunately, those efforts had been without effect, but he could assure their lordships, that he was fully justified in the hope which he held out on a former occasion of the approaching' reconciliation of the parties. Of course it was impossible for him to speak on a subject of this nature with complete certainty; but he could say, that that hope, which had never been entirely extinguished, had been strongly revived by the last accounts which had been received from South America. At the same time he wished to be understood as making that statement with that caution with which all such statements ought to be made. He hoped that in a short time peace would be concluded, and
<col>1222</col>
he was encouraged in entertaining that hope by the information which he had received. No efforts had been wanting on the part of this country, through its ministers at Buenos Ayres or Rio, to produce so happy a result; but it must not be wondered at if those efforts had not been successful among parties, whose pretensions were so wide, and between whom there was so much bitterness against each other. With respect to the injury to our commerce, he understood it arose from two causes; namely, the privateers and the blockade of the country. With respect to the privateers, no effort had been wanting on the part of government to do whatever the law of nations would allow in such a case. Government had received certain information that privateers had been fitted out under letters from Buenos Ayres, with the capital, and under the management of persons in no wise connected with that country. That was a practice contrary to the law of nations, and instructions had been sent out to his majesty's admiral in those quarters to take such energetic measures as would put a stop to that practice, and to punish the persons so employed. With respect to the blockade, he knew that government had received complaints that that blockade, which was very pernicious to commerce, considering that there was a large quantity of British capital in that country, was not an actual blockade, but only a paper one. As soon as these complaints were received in this country, he lost no time in having those statements submitted to his majesty's law officers, in order to procure their advice, as to whether or not the blockade was effectual, and in the event of its not being found effectual, to provide that it should no longer be considered so. The answer given by those whose opinion upon such a subject the government was bound to consult had hitherto been, that they were not in possession of such information as would justify his majesty's government in treating it as a paper blockade. More information had since been produced, and had been submitted to the same authorities; and whenever the blockade of Buenos Ayres should turn out to be not an efficient one, orders would be given that it should no longer be respected. In the mean time, no endeavour was wanting, either on the part of the minister in this country or in South America, to put an end to the warfare by amicable
<image src="S2V0018P0I0619"/>
<col>1223</col>
interference only, by suggesting the terms of peace, which terms, nevertheless, however wise they might be, we had no right to enforce.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01033"><member>Lord Strangford</member><membercontribution> thanked his noble friend for the communication; and though he would think him very ungracious, he must say, that on one of the powers his noble friend could not expect that his recommendations would have any effect. He happened to know, that many of the ministry of that power had become partners in these privateers; and they probably found them too lucrative to put an end to their occupation. They had an interest in keeping up the war. He hoped his noble friend would bear in mind, that of all the new States of South America, only one had been of any service to England. Looking at their acts, and the facts connected with them, from first to last, and seeing that they had swindled us out of twenty-two millions, he must say, that if they were our creation, we had no earthly reason to be proud of them.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH PARISH VESTRIES ACT.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01034"><member>Mr. Hume,</member><membercontribution> in presenting a petition from the Catholics of Ireland against this act, observed, that it had affixed to it the names of peers, merchants, and the leading private Catholic gentlemen of Ireland; and although it had no more than five thousand signatures, he had no doubt that it contained the sentiments of the whole Catholic population of that country upon this subject. He complained of the injustice of the Vestry acts, and recommended the House to take advantage of the example held out to them by the Hungarians, to whom the petition referred. The prayer of the petition was to beg the attention of that House to this&#x2014;that where those of the Catholic persuasion formed seven eighths of the whole population, as regarded the church, and ninety-nine in a hundred of the actual population in many parts of the country, they were justified in entreating the legislature to re-consider the laws which authorized such oppressions and exactions as those enforced against them; they expressed their hope that the House would relieve them from the heavy charges to which they were obliged, by the existing laws, to submit; and they recommended to the con-
<col>1224</col>
sideration of that House the example of the Hungarian Diet in 1791; a body which, like the parliament of England, was composed of men of different orders in the community to the extent of five hundred or six hundred persons; and who, at the time referred to, had passed a resolution, that the Protestants of that state should not contribute to the Catholic churches money or labour; nor, on the other hand, should the Catholics contribute money or labour to the Protestants, nor towards the establishment of their churches.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01035"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> condemned, as highly inconvenient, the custom of discussing questions of great importance on the presentation of a petition. He defended the existing measure as being a great improvement on that which had preceded it. If persons were aggrieved by assessments under the act, a remedy was provided for them, since they had the power to appeal. When he found that those who complained, chose rather to put their petition into the hands of the hon. gentleman than to seek for relief from the proper tribunal, he was inclined to doubt the correctness of their representation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01036"><member>Sir John Newport</member><membercontribution> said, he was convinced that the bill afforded the Catholics no protection, and gave, as a proof of the correctness of his opinion, an instance in which, on a rate having been imposed by a Protestant bishop on the Catholic inhabitants of a parish for the supply of some articles to a church, the Catholics appealed to the Quarter Sessions, and the magistrates decided, that the act gave them no power to interfere with a rate so imposed. In some parts of Ireland, the Catholics were actually in such poverty, that they could not afford to repair their own chapels, and worshipped God almost in the open air. In one parish in the north, the Catholic chapel had been four times burnt down within twenty, years; the last time only five years ago; and while the Catholics were unable at present to rebuild that chapel, they were heavily taxed for the erection of a Protestant church. The injustice of the present state of the law was therefore manifest. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had objected to this discussion, because it put a stop to what he considered more important business. Now, he knew of no business that could be more important than listen-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0620"/>
<col>1225</col>
ing to the complaints of five or six millions of people, of taxation without representation. True it was, that the Secretary of State for the Home Department had promised, with reference to the canons of the church, that a notification should he sent round to the different parishes of Ireland; but he would take upon himself to assert, that even since, and in more than one instance, taxation had been enforced for articles not included in the canons of the church. In fact, the law, as it stood, was no sufficient remedy; and the same species of taxation which took place before the act, had been persevered in since it had passed. The whole was conducted in the most vague manner; and, besides the articles specified, in some instances 18<i>l.</i> and 20<i>l.</i> were charged under the head of contingencies; in fact, unexplained contingencies formed one-fifth of the whole tax. He sincerely hoped, therefore, that the act would be amended, and that the bishops would be deprived of the power of taxing parishes to any extent, and without any control. In his opinion, some person should be made answerable for the observance of due limits in taxation of this kind, and that person ought to be the incumbent of the parish.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01037"><member>Sir R. Inglis</member><membercontribution> admitted that there had been irregularities and infractions of the law under the old system, but contended that they were not enough, either in kind or degree, to warrant an enactment which would have been attended with greater evils than those it proposed to remedy. He complained that on occasions like the present, the right hon. baronet, and others who thought with him, brought forward a certain number of stock-stories, ready cut and dried, for the purpose of making out their case, and that the Catholic Association had done its utmost by its quackery to aggravate and inflame a wound at first of little importance. He then read a passage from a letter from Mr. O'Connell, and an extract from one of his speeches, in the latter of which that gentleman insisted that "the grievance of church rates was a grievance exceeded by no other that was felt in Ireland." The hon. baronet went on to examine, in some detail, the extent of this grievance, and adverted to several distinct cases, as made out by the petitions and returns upon the table. The first was that of Drogheda, which he argued was inapplicable; and the next was that of Thurles, where 32<i>l.</i> had been charged for
<col>1226</col>
hangings in the church. This sum, he contended, was not unreasonable, recollecting that Thurles was the residence of a great ecclesiastic, and that the church was the largest in the diocese. He also adverted to the situation of the parish of Clonolly, and contended, that in all these cases the evil complained of had been greatly exaggerated. If the fact were as Mr. O'Connell stated, that this was the greatest practical grievance in Ireland, he congratulated that country on the little that it had to endure. He also contended that much of the money raised, as appeared by the returns, was devoted to benevolent purposes; in some cases the Catholic schools were supported, the Catholic chapels repaired, and the Catholic priests paid out of the rates. On the whole, it amounted in most instances to about 1&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> per Irish acre, which was the sum of Mr. O'Connell's practical grievance. Were it not invidious, he would ask, what proportion this rate bore to the rent of the land in Ireland, for which twelve guineas, six guineas, and three guineas, per acre were paid? In the north of Ireland the amount of the rate was so small that, it could only be stated in decimals. He regretted that much of what had recently passed upon this subject had destroyed the harmony and good feeling formerly prevailing between the Protestant and Catholic clergy. The result of the whole of his inquiries was, that a state of irritation had been produced which parliament might find it difficult to allay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01038"><member>Mr. J. Grattan</member><membercontribution> denied that any stock-stories had been brought forward, or that the Catholic Association had been guilty of quackery. The former collection and disposition of the rates were most discreditable to all parties concerned, and it was highly important that the legislature should interfere to remedy the evil. The great objection was against the unwarrantable charges under the heads of "Sundries and Contingencies," in some parishes amounting to 20<i>l.</i> or 30<i>l.,</i> without the specification of any particulars. In his opinion, the evil could only effectually be remedied by throwing open the vestries, and admitting Roman Catholics into them. He hoped the right hon. gentleman would take the subject into his consideration; but if he would not, he trusted the hon. member for Aberdeen would bring in a bill to amend the existing act.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01039"><member>Mr. Spriny Rice</member><membercontribution> supported the prayer of the petition. The cases of complaint under this act were not imaginary, as the hon. baronet had supposed. No church could be built in this country without the consent of parliament; but in Ireland the question was settled by a select vestry, consisting exclusively of members of the Established: Church, and they were generally parties interested in the disposal of the rate to be levied on the Dissenters and Catholics. The worst enemies of the Established Church were those who wished to prolong these abuses, by which the feelings of the people were excited against it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ELECTION EXPENSES&#x2014;USE OF RIBBONS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01042"><member>Mr. Fyler</member><membercontribution> presented two petitions for the repeal of the act of last session, to prevent the use of Ribbons at Elections. One of them was signed by 5,000 silk-weavers, inhabitants of Coventry; and the other by between 1,700 and 1,800 silk-weavers of Spitalfields. He concurred with the petitioners that their apprehension was well founded, that this act would do great mischief to the silk trade. The hon. gentleman then rose, pursuant to notice, to move for leave to bring in a Bill "to repeal so much of the act of last session as prohibited the use of ribbons at Elections." It would be in the recollection of the House, that this bill was introduced by the noble member for Northamptonshire. In its original shape, the bill merely went to deprive the counsel, agents, and attorneys, employed by the candidates, from voting at the election; but, from the use of the word "flagger," he concluded that it never could have been the intention of the noble lord to interfere with the silk trade. He was the more disposed to think that the House could have no objection to review its decision, when he recollected that the bill was brought in at a late period of the session, when many gentlemen had left town; and that it was finally passed through the House at two o'clock in the morning, when there were only thirty-six members present. The hon. member "then proceeded to take a review of the laws passed against extravagant expense on
<col>1228</col>
the subject, from the time of Edward 3rd to the present day; and contended, that such laws, from their bad effects upon trade, were absurd and impolitic, while they at the same time gave men the suspicion, that the members of that House, in the present case, were actuated by considerations purely selfish, and merely desired to diminish the expenses of their election. The silk trade, however, was a plant of exotic growth, and of delicate fibre; and, unless they made up their minds to apply to it those principles of free trade which they allowed to govern their opinions with respect to other branches of our commerce and manufactures, he was satisfied they would have to regret its total extinction, notwithstanding the extent of our capital, or the superiority of our workmen. In the ribbon trade of the city of Coventry, he believed he might safely say, that nine-teen-twentieths of the population of the city were constantly employed. At times this trade was dull, like every other; but the ribbon manufacturers were always in the habit of looking forward to the consumption of a general Election as their refuge in the hour of distress; as the asylum of their hopes, and their sheet anchor in the storm. The hon. gentleman then went on to observe, that the consequences of this restriction upon the wearing of ribbons, would not be such as the hon. member for Limerick supposed. The bill would not save the expense of elections, while, at the same time, by throwing numbers of industrious workmen out of employment, it would tend to increase smuggling, poaching, and the commission of every kind of crime; in short, it would have the effect of demoralizing, he might almost say, of revolutionizing the people. What, he would ask, could they expect from men who once received the poor-rate? From that moment all the habits of the man became altered. His feelings were debased. He nourished ideas of bloodshed and revenge, and ceased to consider himself as a member of the same society with which he had mingled before. The hon. member for Limerick had been engaged in putting an end to the expense of Yeomanry corps, but he would say, give the people employment, and then where would be the necessity for these corps in the manufacturing districts, if the people were happy and contented? That House, enshrined in all its omnipotence, and entrenched in all
<image src="S2V0018P0I0622"/>
<col>1229</col>
its powers, could not hope to conquer custom. Party always had distinctive marks in this country. From the time of the wars between the houses of York and Lancaster, there had always been ensigns of party, and he did not see why the privilege allowed to the high should be withheld from the low. After contending, that the state of Ireland was different from that of this country, and observing that the law against wearing ribbons at elections in that kingdom was passed in 1796, two years before the great rebellion, and when parties were extremely violent, the hon. member proceeded to ridicule the clause which prohibited a candidate from giving a ribbon to any one, even his own wife, during the time of an election, under a penalty of ten pounds: this penalty, too, to be given to the informer, without any limitation of time as to laying the information. Upon the whole, considering that the bill would not save expense, that it was injurious to his constituents, and that it was a blot upon the Statute-book, he would move for leave to bring in a bill to repeal so much of the act as prohibits the use of ribbons at elections.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01043"><member>Colonel Wood</member><membercontribution> seconded the motion, on public and private grounds. His private reasons, if the House would allow him to state them, were, that he had had some hundreds of Coventry men in his regiment; and when he parted from them, he promised, that if ever it was in his power to do them a good turn, he would recollect them. This was the first opportunity he had had to fulfil his promise, and he therefore seconded the hon. member's motion. The bill itself he considered, indeed, in a public view, to be calculated to do much injury to the trade in fancy ribbons, without producing any great advantage. He considered a measure prohibitory of the use of ribbons at elections as one partaking too much of minutiae for legislation. If there were any part of the law relating to Elections which he was desirous to see repealed, the Treating-bill was one that called for repeal far more than any enactment respecting the use of ribbons. The most wasteful extravagance was incurred by out-voters going from London and other places to Yorkshire and other remote places, at the expense of the candidates. Many persons took advantage of this opportunity of paying a visit to their friends once in seven years. This was very severe upon candidates, who
<col>1230</col>
were obliged to pay these expenses. This law, and the law permitting non-resident voters to vote at elections, were productive of far greater inconvenience than the law prohibiting the use of ribbons, which, in his opinion, would always be evaded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01044"><member>Mr. S. Rice</member><membercontribution> said, he would decline to follow the hon. mover over the various irrelevant topics which he had somewhat strangely introduced into a discussion upon moving for leave to bring in a bill to repeal an act of last session, prohibiting the use of ribbons at elections. He would meet the motion of the hon. member at once, by announcing his intention to vote against it. It was the duty of the House to cheapen the expenses at elections. This was the only effectual mode of restraining bribery at elections, and of making them free. The most extravagant expense was incurred frequently at elections by the use of ribbons. At the last election for the county of Northumberland, the expense laid out on ribbons was 6,000<i>l.</i> He did not think that any act of legislation should be adopted for the sake of rendering a partial benefit to a particular place, which would have the effect of rendering expenses at elections unnecessarily greater than they were at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01045"><member>Lord Lowther</member><membercontribution> opposed the motion. He had some experience of contested elections, and he could give his testimony, that the act of last session was expedient to check the extravagance which prevailed in the wasteful distribution of ribbons at elections.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01046"><member>Mr. Fyler</member><membercontribution> replied. The opposition which had been offered to his motion was, he said, to be traced to one principle&#x2014; self&#x2014;nothing but self. He hoped he should have a majority in favour of the bill, and that the House would not, under the influence of such considerations, toss the poor weavers of Coventry overboard.</membercontribution></p>

<title>RIGHT OF ELECTION IN COUNTIES<lb/> CORPORATE.]</title><p id="S2V0018P0-01048"><member>Mr. Sykes</member><membercontribution> rose pursuant to notice, to move for leave to bring in a bill "to declare the Rights of Freeholders in separate districts or counties, to vote at the election of Knights of the Shire of the counties from which they shall have been separated." The hon. gentleman, after adverting to the conduct of some
<image src="S2V0018P0I0623"/>
<col>1231</col>
hon. gentlemen, who, on a former occasion, had, after professing themselves friendly to the principle of the measure he proposed, deserted him, upon a plea of not concurring in the mode in which he had brought the question forward, proceeded to declare, that to him it was perfectly indifferent what course he pursued, provided he could persuade the House to acquiesce in the object which he was desirous of obtaining. It would probably be convenient to the House, that he should discard all the learned lumber with which he had been obliged, on a former evening, to preface his notice on the subject. The hon. gentleman then went into a brief history of the origin of counties corporate, which had, in times past, been separated from their parent counties in virtue of various specific charters. Whatever alterations in the other rights and privileges of the districts so detached such charters might have effected, it was manifest that they could not legally interfere with the exercise of any existing elective franchise, formerly by such districts enjoyed. That was the position upon which he meant to contend for the principle of this bill. He should submit, that this being clearly the law of the case, although the usage, in respect of these counties corporate, had not been in conformity to the law, it was high time that parliament should declare what that law, or rather what that usage, ought to be. There were eighteen of these districts or counties corporate. There were three of them in which the freeholders had votes for the election of members for counties, Poole, Southampton, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Six others, for some causes which at that distance of time were not very easy to be ascertained, had acquired a right to vote for the election of burgesses or knights of the shire, to serve in parliament for the town or county from which they were so detached. With this right it was not his intention in any manner to interfere; but he did not think it fair, that the other counties corporate should not be participators in the same right in their own cases. Besides the three he had already mentioned, there were these six:&#x2014;Bristol, Haverfordwest, Litchfield, Norwich, Nottingham, and Exeter; in all nine, which had the privileges he had spoken of. And these were without it:&#x2014;York, Lincoln, Newark, Coventry, Kingston-upon-Hull, Canterbury, Chester, Caernarvon, and Worcester. Now, the mode in which he
<col>1232</col>
proposed to deal with all these counties corporate was, to give them the right of voting at elections for knights of the shires within which they were severally situated. He came to parliament to ask for this right, because parliament alone could bestow it. To acts of parliament more than one of the counties in this kingdom owed the possession of a similar privilege; and those of Chester and Durham were striking instances of that fact. The hon. gentleman then spoke of the little reliance which could be placed, in matters of this kind, upon the reports of committees upstairs, appointed to inquire into them; and cited two counter-decisions in the years 1739 and 1747 to account for his not now moving for such a committee in preference to a bill. Two objections had been heretofore taken to his proposition; the first, that it was an innovation; the second, that it was a branch of the system of reform. Now it was no such innovation; for in some of the cases it would but restore a right formerly enjoyed by the county corporate; in others, it would confer it where it ought to be possessed. As for reform, he was not ashamed to avow himself friendly to a general reform of the present constitution of parliament, as a measure which would be attended with great good to the country; yet, on the present occasion, he waived all argument upon that point, and should be contented to see the right for which he contended given to the districts he had indicated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01049"><member>Colonel Sibthorp</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;I rise to second the motion. From the most mature investigation of this question, involving the rights and privileges of so many, and feeling as I do for them, as affecting all, I may perhaps be more particular in my application to those whom I have the honour to represent&#x2014;comprising the populous city of Lincoln, of upwards of ten thousand inhabitants, and the villages annexed thereto, of full twenty miles in circumference, and containing in the total near four hundred and sixty freeholds. These individuals ask and seek no new privileges, no novel rights, but the restoration of those rights which they once exercised in common with others, and of which heavy impositions and exactions of former times have deprived them. The learned Attorney-general said, on a former night, that the freeholders of the city and borough alluded to had made a bargain with the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0624"/>
<col>1233</col>
government; that they had purchased exemption from county rates, &amp;c, and, therefore, that the depriving them of those privileges was no severity. I confess I do not consider that a bargain, which is forced, from which they could not free themselves, and to which if they did submit tacitly it was because they were compelled to do so. A right hon. gentleman (Mr. Wynn) had said, that our whole constitutional system was a collection of anomalies, arising from various causes. These were got rid of by act of parliament, declaring the last final and decisive. I have heard constantly of an act to amend an act; and if there are grievances in any act, why not do in that case what the hon. member for Hull states was done in similar cases? As for the privilege of voting for counties, according to what is now required; remove these grievances by another act of parliament, and confirm by restoration the enjoyment before exercised. I hold authorities in my hand to prove, that in all the acts of those reigns that had so separated the city from the county, as far as realises it a county within itself, the former rights and privileges are expressly stated as reserved and unmolested; and I do think, in the ancient and loyal city of Lincoln, the right of a freeholder being vested in the soil, and not by grant or charter, there is every right for the possessors of soil therein to have a voice. I do hope parliament will give the subject that consideration to which such an important measure has every claim. I repeat, it is no novel right, no new privilege, but a restoration of former rights, that is sought for.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ASSESSMENT OF LESSORS (IRELAND).]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01052"><member>Mr. James Grattan</member><membercontribution> rose to move for leave to bring in a bill "to render Lessors liable for county and parish assessments in all future lettings of land in Ireland." The hon. member observed, that complaints had been made from all parts of Ireland of the hardship of making the occupiers of land liable for permanent assessments. They were not only called upon to pay for roads and bridges, in which it might be said they were inter-
<col>1234</col>
ested, but also for gaols, hospitals, and other public buildings, for which presentments were granted by grand juries. This was a hardship which the proposed bill would remedy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01053"><member>Mr. V. Fitzgerald</member><membercontribution> said, he would not oppose the principle of the bill, but he could not consent to so wide an extension of that principle as the hon. member proposed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01055"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> defended the necessity of the present measure. More than half the amount of grand-jury assessments in Ireland were not for objects in which the occupying tenant could be said to have a direct interest.

<title>ADMISSION OF FREEMEN IN CITIES<lb/> AND BOROUGHS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01056"><member>Mr. Ross</member><membercontribution> rose, pursuant to notice, to move for leave to bring in a Bill "to regulate the Admission of Freemen in Cities and Boroughs." The objects he had in view were, to diminish the expenses candidates were put to at elections, by being made to pay for the admission of freemen, and for bringing them down from town to the election. There were many towns which had a far greater number of non-resident freemen than resident freemen. Dover had one thousand two hundred resident, and one thousand eight hundred non-resident freemen; Lancaster had only five hundred residents and three thousand non-residents. For all these non-residents the candidate was obliged to pay the expense of coming from London to the city or borough to which they belonged, and not only that, but often the expense of taking up their freedom. It thus happened, that, in years of contested elections, from five hundred to one thousand two hundred freemen were admitted, whilst in other years there would not be more than a dozen. He proposed, therefore, that all persons entitled to take up their freedom should be bound to do so twelve months from the time of their becoming entitled
<image src="S2V0018P0I0625"/>
<col>1235</col>
to do it. The hon. member concluded by moving for leave to bring in the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01057"><member>Lord Nugent</member><membercontribution> doubted whether the bill would effect the objects of the hon. member; namely, the correction of the abuse of the creation of freemen during the poll or immediately before it, and the expense of bringing up voters. It might injuriously affect the rights of persons at present out of the country. He had himself, last session, introduced a bill on the subject; but he would rather see the matter in the hands of the hon. member than his own, and he would give him every assistance in his power in framing the provisions of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01058"><member>Lord Lowther</member><membercontribution> said, they had so many election bills at present before the House, that he thought it would be impossible to do justice to them all. Besides, he thought the bill now proposed would be perfectly ineffective. He considered it to be one of the many attempts at petty legislation respecting the right of voting, which the House was almost daily in the habit of witnessing. He should oppose the introduction of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01059"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> opposed the bill, as not only inadequate to the object proposed, but as greatly aggravating the evil it was designed to remedy. He was far from believing that all admissions were at the expense of the candidate; at least his own experience falsified the statement. But if it were so, the proposed bill would increase the expenses of an election; for as every man who claimed the right of admission would be anxious to possess it, he would go to the place in which it originated at an expense, the reimbursement of which he would expect whenever a contest arose, and thus throw on the candidates the charges of two journeys when one would suffice. But he was chiefly opposed to every measure of this sort because it began at the wrong end. If it were really an object to prevent the payment of admissions by candidates, why did not the hon. mover propose a bill by which the candidate should be compelled to swear that he had not by himself, nor his agents, paid or promised to pay, and that he would not hereafter by himself, or his agents, directly or indirectly, pay for the admissions; and, further, fix a high penalty on the detection of the offence, of which the mere receiving the money should be evidence? This would be an intelligible remedy. But it was quite the fashion of
<col>1236</col>
modern reformers to relieve members of parliament from expenses by curtailing the few existing rights of the electors&#x2014;a plan to which he would never assent; and, therefore, without any disrespect to the hon. member, but to save him and the House trouble, he should oppose the bill in the outset.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SOCIETY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF<lb/> THE GOSPEL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01061"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> said, that before he proceeded to make the motion of which he had given notice, he begged leave to set right the character of the person from whom he had, on a former occasion, presented a petition. He had understood the right rev. prelate to object to the petitioner, that he was a man of so irritable a temper that it was impossible to agree with him, and that other persons had complained of him so much, that it was impossible the Society could continue to employ him as a missionary. Now, he held in his hand a copy of a memorial which had been sent to the Society in favour of Mr. Griffin: it was signed by fifty-four inhabitants of Bridgetown, where Mr. Griffin had formerly resided, and the first signature was that of a justice of the peace. It expressed the satisfaction of the memorialists with the conduct of Mr. Griffin, and requested that he might be appointed to officiate at a chapel, as the memorialists were fully persuaded that by so doing, the best interests of the church of England, and of religion and virtue would be promoted. It was dated in 1826. He believed there did exist, as was stated, bitter contentions in the colonies, and that they were aggravated by the proceedings of the Society. Nor was it at all unnatural, that it should be so; for a very great proportion of the people there were presbyterians, who had a strong feeling of dislike against the exercise of any kind of patronage in the appointment of clergymen, and who liked to appoint their own ministers. The people had very strong objections to the person who had succeeded Mr. Griffin, and not liking him, they had deserted the church. The Society had aggravated the natural causes for these contentions. He was sorry to give so much trouble to the pure body which he saw opposite; but he was sure their
<image src="S2V0018P0I0626"/>
<col>1237</col>
appearance was not without a motive. He did hope, that as the object of his motion would be to inquire into the sums of public money expended in a particular way through the Society for the service of the colonies, and involved a charge of extravagant expenditure, it would not be opposed; but when he saw the noble ex-secretary for the colonies in his place, and supported by that holy alliance behind him, he concluded that his motion was to be opposed. The petitioner stated, that there were many abuses by missionaries, and that the funds furnished by the government were misapplied. He charged the Society with being ignorant of the manner in which the money was disposed of; that there were great abuses in the expenditure in the colonies; and he stated that he had received the offer of a considerable sum of money to induce him not to present his petition, and not to provoke a public discussion. Now, he objected strongly to the government transferring the duty of providing for the expenses of the church of England in the colonies to the Society; and he objected to it on these grounds:&#x2014;The population of our North American colonies were, most of them, Presbyterians, Baptists, Independents&#x2014;any thing but members of the church of England. If the funds appropriated for the support of the ministers of religion were disposed of by government, it would in some casts, give a part of them to the religious ministers of the great body of the people; while, as long as those funds were disposed of by the Society, they would all be appropriated to one sect&#x2014;not to supply the religious wants of the great body of the people, but to maintain in opulence the ministers of the smallest, sect. If the money were disposed of by the government, and not by the Society, it would not be all exclusively appropriated to the church of England. In the present disposal of the grant, no respect whatever was shown to the wants of the colonies; in which nine-tenths of the people were Presbyterians or Dissenters of one kind or another. It was said, that if there were no public grants, the church of England could not be maintained. But how was the Presbyterian church maintained? Why, the people paid for their own ministers by subscription, by letting seats, or by some other means. Was it not. curious, that the members of the church of England were
<col>1238</col>
the only sect who would not provide for their own ministers? He could not agree with the statement, the claim rather, that it was the duty of government to provide, by taxing the people of England, for the maintenance of the church of England in the colonies. It might be the duty of the government to provide for the expenses of the church establishment in the colonies; but if such a church establishment were required there, it ought to be provided for at the expense of the colonists themselves. The noble earl, indeed, and Dr. Philpott, might agree in taking this expense from our taxes; they might make common cause in their attack on the public purse; they might say that it was the duty of the government to provide for the maintenance of the members of the church of England in the colonies; but, supposing the United States of America still remained our colonies, would such a claim for them be made? Such a supposition was most preposterous. He would allow the government to apply the resources of the colonies to support a church there, if that were necessary; but he objected to its calling on this country to pay for it. Let the members of the church of England, he would say, provide their own ministers. It was the duty of government to burthen the people as little as possible with taxation, and it might be another duty to provide ministers for the colonies; but we sacrificed one of these duties to the other. The Society had got a very good name. It was the "Society for the Propagation of the Gospel;" and having got this good name, it seemed to be thought that the Society was invested with the attribute of royalty, and could do no wrong. The Society seemed to him to desire that, more than Papal power&#x2014;that prostration of the will and understanding, which they had once been told best became all Christians. No individual, it seemed, was to touch the ark of the Society's accounts, though it had public money to dispose of. With its own funds the Society might do as it pleased; it might provide ministers for the colonies if it pleased, or the colonies might provide them for themselves; but what he objected to was, the appropriation of the public money, through the Society, for this purpose. Such was not the manner, however, in which the funds of the Society were originally employed. At the origin of the Society they were employed in con-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0627"/>
<col>1239</col>
tributing to provide missionaries for distant parts of the country, where the people were poor and wretched, and had not the means of providing themselves with religious instruction. But now the Society paid missionaries 200<i>l</i>. a year who lived in towns. It was not with such views that the Society was established. But now the Society paid missionaries who resided in towns, the inhabitants of which did not require any, and were able and willing to provide ministers for themselves; but if they were to have ministers forced on them&#x2014;if these ministers were persons whom they did not choose to hear&#x2014;was it to be expected that they would contribute to support them? The first abuse of which he complained was, that the Society took money raised by taxes in England to pay the church establishment in the colonies. The next abuse was the manner in which this money was employed, in supporting pluralities, such as giving money to persons as missionaries, who held other situations or benefices&#x2014;a rectory, for example&#x2014;or who enjoyed a place in a college, having salary, and also other duties to attend to. The third abuse was, that there was no person who was responsible for the disposal of the funds supplied from our taxes. He had heard, the other day, the right rev. prelate say, he was only an individual member of the Society who sometimes took the chair in the absence of his superior; but he disclaimed all responsibility.&#x2014;[The bishop of London here said, that he took his full share of the responsibility, but not more than any other trustee.] The charge against the Society was, that money was granted by the Society, and no person knew how it was disposed of. The money was granted, and that very responsible person, Mr. Nobody, accounted for it. This was a case, he thought, for inquiry. Their lordships had also been informed, that in the settlement of one of the colonies, one-seventh of the land had been set apart for the church. It was of considerable extent; but they were told that it was now unavailing, and of no value. Was it meant, he would ask, that the church should keep one-seventh of the land, and that we should also burthen ourselves with maintaining the clergy? If it was necessary to provide otherwise for the church, we ought to take back the land. That seventh was scattered through the country, and, as it was not cultivated, it impeded in a sensible degree, the progress of the
<col>1240</col>
colony. The land belonging to the church was not cultivated, and it interfered with the cultivation of other land; so that the colony was injured, to provide for the expenses of the church of England. Their lordships had been told, that the practice of the Society was, when a church was built, to make a grant, and perhaps their lordships supposed, that a church meant a building like some of the churches in Regent-street, or like some of Mr. Nash's churches; but he was informed that a church in the colonies, under these circumstances, meant only a mere log-house, a few pieces of timber placed together, sometimes with doors and windows, and sometimes without. He was informed that the practice was this:&#x2014;As the Society always gave an income for a clergyman when a church was built, some missionary, or some person who wanted a living, went a few miles, twenty or thirty, into the back settlements, where he found a few scattered people and a few small houses, and he induced them to build a log-house, and call it a church; or they put their names to a piece of paper as subscribers to a church, with the understanding that they were never to be called on to pay for it; a wooden frame of rough boards or trees was put together, information was sent to the Society that a church was established in such a place, and that a clergyman was wanted; immediately the zealous missionary received his 200<i>l</i>. a year, and an old missionary received 30<i>l</i>. a year more to visit the new establishment now and then. This was the way, as he understood, that new missionaries were wanted and provided for. The authority of the noble earl, the late Secretary for the Colonies, was very great; but it would not, he hoped, satisfy the Finance Committee, and he doubted if it would satisfy any reasonable man, that the Society ought to receive so large a grant of the public money. The Society even went in extravagance beyond the noble earl. He said 200<i>l</i>. a year was sufficient, but the Society gave 300<i>l</i>. a-year. He objected to the government giving its authority and money to this Society; he objected to the Society, that nobody knew how the money was expended, or was responsible for it; and all these made up, he thought, a case of great abuse, which required to be inquired into. He would therefore move, "That a Committee be appointed to inquire into the Expenditure

of the public money granted to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in his Majesty's Colonies of North America."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01062"><member>Earl Bathurst</member><membercontribution> said, he had formerly stated, that he conceived the allegations of the petition did not justify the appointment of a committee, and he had heard nothing, in what had fallen from the noble lord, to make him alter his opinion. The noble lord had not rested his case solely on the petition. The noble lord said, that the public money distributed by the Society was made over to the Society by the government, in order to provide for the members of the church of England. The noble lord objected to this country being charged with the expense of maintaining the clergy of the church of England in the colonies; and he seemed to think that this was a new principle, first introduced into practice in 1813, when he (lord Bathurst) was Secretary of State for the Colonies. But he must tell the noble lord, so far was this from being a new principle, that ever since 1702 grants have been uniformly made by the government to the Society, for the ministers of the church of England in the North American colonies. Within the last sixteen years those grants had been considerably increased. In 1811, 1812, and 1813, the grants had been 2,600<i>l</i>. a year. Subsequently to that time a great increase had been made; but the arrangement was this:&#x2014;The government had agreed to pay to each missionary appointed by the Society as much as the Society gave. The Society gave generally 70<i>l</i>. to each missionary, and the government charged itself with an additional 70<i>l</i>. In 1813, in consequence of repeated representations made from the colonies, it was found necessary to increase the allowance. This necessity produced the difference of expense; for the government found that, as two persons were wanted where one only was before requisite, it had to give 140<i>l</i>. when it only gave 70<i>l</i>. before. It was found also, that vacancies could not be filled without difficulty; complaints were at the same time made of the want of clergymen, and, therefore, it was determined to increase the salary to 200<i>l</i>. a year. When this arrangement was made, government had to give 100<i>l</i>. instead of 70<i>l</i>. for each missionary. At the same time, the increase of the population made it necessary that there should be a great augmentation in the number of the minis-
<col>1242</col>
ters. Proofs of this necessity were sent from the colonies to this country; and as the number of missionaries increased, their lordships would see that there was also an increase of that sum which the government was called on to advance. Since that time there had been a continual increase of the population, which made a continual increase of the expense necessary. In 1813 the number of missionaries was between thirty and forty; now there were one hundred and four. The noble lord seemed to suppose that this increase had been made for the sake of patronage to the Society or to individuals; but this could not be the case, for there was a great difficulty in obtaining persons to fill the situation. The difficulty was to get any qualified person to accept the office, not to make a selection amongst many. Even with a salary of 200<i>l</i>. a year, the Society found it a very difficult task to procure proper persons as missionaries. The noble lord said, it was the regulation of the Society not to send out a missionary until a church was ready; and that the churches in that country were not like the churches in this. But if it were necessary not to send out missionaries until the churches of that country were built with as much magnificence as the churches here, he was afraid no missionary would ever be sent. The churches there were fit for the purposes of the people; and the great majority of them were not those mere log-huts which the noble lord had described; and whoever supposed they were such, committed a gross mistake. If the noble lord had derived his information from the gentleman whose petition he had presented, it would shew their lordships, as he hoped more fully to satisfy them presently, that no dependence whatever could be placed on his statements. It did not entirely depend on the Society to send out missionaries: application was also made by the population of the colonies: and frequent applications had been made by the governors of our colonies, who represented the urgent necessity of sending out a number of competent persons. With respect to Upper Canada, the population of which had of late so much increased, he had received representations from the lieutenant-governor, which proved the evils inflicted on the colonies by the want of missionaries. He prayed earnestly, that some might be sent out, as the consequence of not having them was, that a number of adventurers
<image src="S2V0018P0I0629"/>
<col>1243</col>
from the United States had come into Canada, and made it their business to supply the place of ministers of the Gospel. The lieutenant-governor was of opinion, that policy required, that those who taught his majesty's subjects religion ought to be subjects of his majesty, and not citizens of the United States. He therefore saw no occasion whatever to believe that the expenditure of the Society or the number of missionaries had been unnecessarily increased since 1813. If their lordships considered the great increase of population which had taken place in the colonies since the peace, they would see that the Society would not have discharged its duty had it not increased the number of missionaries. Their lordships had heard no complaints from the colonies against the Society; which was sufficient to make them think the allegations of the petition not founded. But who was the petitioner? He was himself a missionary, who had been employed for five or six years, and had at length' been removed, on the bishop of the diocese representing that he was of so irritable a disposition, that his residence there could no longer be of advantage. The Society had approved of the recommendation and removed the petitioner; and this person, who had been a missionary between five and six years, and who had, during that period, been silent, now asked their lordships to adopt a measure which would instantly discharge one hundred and four missionaries. His petition shewed that he was not fit to discharge the duties he had taken on himself. The noble earl read a letter which the petitioner had written to Mr. Huskisson in January 25, 1828, about six weeks ago. The letter described the natives as treating the English as aliens, bastards, and intruders, denying them all privileges, persecuting them, and ill-treating them in all sorts of ways; stating also, that the persecutors of the English in the colony were sure to be promoted; and concluding by saying, "Hear, Old England, and be astonished&#x0021;" This letter was such a proof of the temper of the petitioner, that it would prevent, he was sure, their lordships from placing confidence in any of his assertions. The letter was indeed so damning a proof of the character of the petitioner, that he ought, perhaps, to apologize for saying one word more on the subject. The noble lord had formerly stated, when he had spoken of the mismanagement of the Society, that it
<col>1244</col>
had encouraged pluralities; and had given, as an instance, the case of a gentleman who had been appointed a missionary at Quebec, and who, not finding that place agree with his health, did not reside there, but went to live at Prince Edward's Island, eight hundred miles distant. The petitioner had said, that he had been removed from Prince Edward's Island in consequence of the complaints he had made of the above person's receiving his salary without doing any thing for it. This was not the fact; and he was removed in consequence of the serious differences which had existed between him and the inhabitants of the island. The first reason of this difference was characteristic of the man and of his general conduct. He had not been many weeks at Prince Edward's Island, when he addressed a letter to the Society, representing that there was a certain missionary in the island who was, and had long been, in the performance of all the duties of a clergyman, but who was not in priest's, but only in deacon's orders. He stated, that he had for thirteen years taken upon himself to officiate as a priest, and even to administer the sacrament, it must have been well known to the petitioner when he made this representation, that severe penalties would lie against any man who acted in the manner stated of this individual. As soon as the Society received this representation, they called upon the clergyman in question for an explanation of what had been alleged against him. The answer which the Society received was perfectly satisfactory; for the clergyman who had been so unjustly accused, sent to the Society his powers of ordination as a priest, which was dated as far back as 1774. The gentleman was at that time eighty years of age. As he had many friends in Prince Edward's Island, and was highly esteemed, it was not to be imagined, that a person bringing so unfounded a charge against this virtuous clergyman could escape censure. He did not mean to assert that Mr. Griffin, when he wrote that letter to the Society, was aware of its untruth. He had heard as a mere report, that the clergyman against whom he thought proper to bring this serious charge was not in priest's orders, and his propensity to believe whatever he heard to the prejudice of any man, induced him to think himself warranted in circulating the scandal, and in making it a ground of applying to the Society upon
<image src="S2V0018P0I0630"/>
<col>1245</col>
the subject. No sooner was the petitioner out of this scrape, than he got into another; for it was impossible for him to remain quiet in any situation, or under any circumstances. He went to another island, and there got into a quarrel with the churchwardens. He could not take upon himself to say, whether a missionary had, or had not, a right to examine a churchwarden's accounts; but Mr. Griffin chose to assume such a power, and to make his pretensions a source of discord. A short time after his arrival there he wrote a most violent letter, charging a Mr. Ross with having been a party in a riot, or in an outrage of a criminal nature. In consequence of this, an <i>ex officio</i> information was filed against him by the Attorney-general; and, when the time came for the complainant to make his charges good, he found himself obliged to withdraw them.&#x2014;He would now call their lordships' attention to a serious and singular charge, which that gentleman had preferred respecting the venerable bishop of Nova Scotia. He had represented that the bishop, a few months after his appointment to that see, had come over to this country, and was residing here, receiving the revenues of his office, and without performing its duties. Let this case be what it might, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel had nothing to do with it; they had no concern whatever in it, and if there were any thing improper in the proceedings, he, (lord B.) and he alone, was to blame. The gentleman to whom he referred was Dr. Stunzer, and he had owed his elevation to the bishopric to causes totally independent of interest. This gentleman had been the rector of St. Paul's, the principal parish of Halifax, for thirty years and upwards, and had given general satisfaction to his parishioners. His integrity of life and amiable disposition had gained him the esteem and good-will of every person. Upon the death of the preceding bishop, a representation came to this country, signed by all the respectable inhabitants, whatever their persuasions, stating that Dr. Stunzer had faithfully served, for thirty years, as a clergyman in that country, and begging that government would recommend his appointment to the vacant bishopric. It did so happen that this gentleman had not what was vulgarly called a patron in this country; or, if he had, he had either forgotten the circumstance, or the patron had
<col>1246</col>
forgotten him. He (lord B.) had not received one word in favour of Dr. Stunzer, from any person in this country, whilst he certainly did receive applications in favour of other persons desirous of the appointment. Upon considering all the circumstances of the case, he had submitted his name to his majesty, who wag pleased to direct that a patent should be made out, constituting Dr. Stunzer, bishop of Nova Scotia. He had not been bishop above a year, or a year and a half, when, unfortunately a most destructive fire broke out at Halifax. A fire in that part of the world was infinitely more disastrous than in this, as the merchants, and all acquainted with the place, well knew that the Houses were principally built of wood; and what greatly increased the calamity in question was, its happening in the midst of winter. As soon as accounts of the accident were received, the bishop repaired to the scene of danger; and by his advice, and his personal exertions, he greatly contributed to extinguish, the fire. From his not having been accustomed to manual labour, his great age, and the severity of the exertions he made, this venerable prelate was seized with a severe fit of illness, which ended in a paralytic stroke. His medical advisers strongly persuaded him to repair to this country, as the only possible means of recovering his health. His friends equally persuaded him; and it was the wish of all those inhabitants who venerated his character, and were impressed with a due sense of his long and faithful discharge of his sacred functions. In the following year, Dr. Stunzer had represented to him his desire to go back to Nova Scotia, but that his physicians had told him he might expect fatal consequences from his return to that climate. Similar reports were made for another year, when he (lord Bathust) thought proper to have the case submitted to the late Dr. Baillie, with a desire that he should state, whether, in his opinion, there was any chance of the bishop's recovering his health sufficiently to admit of his return to America. Dr. Baillie, in reply, stated that, in fact, there was no chance. He reported that Dr. Stunzer might possibly, by great care and attention, live some time longer in this country; but as to his health being sufficiently restored to admit of his resuming his functions, it was utterly impossible. It then became his (lord B's.) official duty to examine this gentleman himself, and to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0631"/>
<col>1247</col>
explain to him that it was out of his power to return; that all hope of his being restored to health, sufficiently for any such a purpose, was out of the question; and he felt it his duty to recommend him to resign his office. He said to him, that he was well aware that while he was in England, the bishop's commissary was in the discharge of the episcopal functions, and that, therefore, his absence from the colony for a time was not material; but that there were some duties which a bishop could alone perform, such, for example, as Confirmation, and that consequently the long-continued absence of the diocesan from the colony, from any reason whatever was inconvenient, and that he thought it essential that such an inconvenience should be removed. Dr. Stunzer replied, that he was perfectly ready to resign, but that he had sunk his private fortune, and had nothing whatever to live upon. In consequence of this, applications were made to the governments of New Brunswick and of Nova Scotia: out of their funds the first province consented to grant to Dr. Stunzer an allowance of 350<i>l</i>. per annum; whilst Nova Scotia granted 250<i>l</i>., and upon his recommendation, the Society added 200<i>l</i>. per annum more. Many noble lords might possibly think these sums extravagant; but for his part, he was not of that opinion. It must be recollected, that he had had no power, no right, no authority, to require Dr. Stunzer's resignation; and if he had possessed such powers, he had no hesitation in saying that he would not have exercised them without taking care to provide for the individual. He confessed that he was not one of those who possessed that iron sense of duty to put to any man the alternatives of going out to Halifax to die, or to stay at home and starve. Whatever impropriety there might have been in the transaction, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was wholly and intirely innocent of it: the blame, if any blame did exist, rested exclusively on him. The petitioner was a gentleman who, unfortunately, from an exasperated state of mind, could not be relied upon; and there was no groundwork laid to induce the House to institute the examination which was required. He should, therefore, oppose the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01063"><member>Lord Goderich</member><membercontribution> said, it would be unnecessary for him, after what had fallen from his noble friend, to trouble their lordships with any extended reasonings upon the subject; but he must say that he thought
<col>1248</col>
the rev. gentleman, whose petition was the ground-work of the present motion, was, of all the petitioners whose cases he had had to consider, the most unfortunate in failing to produce any reasoning or any substantial allegations, calculated to obtain the respect or attention of the House. The noble lord had admitted that there was no ground on which he could found his motion, except the assertions of the reverend petitioner; and he had asserted the other night, that he was prepared to rest his case exclusively on that petition. His noble friend on the other side the House had fully shown, that the rev. gentleman had displayed no small measure of the temper in which he was always disposed to treat all persons and all things which did not suit his feelings. Wherever the rev. gentleman went, he seemed determined to get into hot water with somebody. He would, however, wish to make the House believe that he was one of the most mild and inoffensive of human beings, and that he was always the victim of some malignant or cunning conspiracy wherever he went. He had read the petition over, and he must confess, that it appeared to him to contain a good deal of that figure of rhetoric, which was usually known by the designation of rigmarole; and that no part of it was of a nature to require any great degree of attention. But he had in his possession a curious specimen of the temper in which this rev. gentleman was disposed to express himself when his views were thwarted, or when his feelings were under excitement. What he would read to the House was a specimen of his style of epistolary correspondence with those who had the misfortune not to please him; and when the House had heard it, their lordships would not be surprised at the perpetual hot water into which the rev. gentleman seemed plunged. In 1826, this rev. gentleman had taken it into his head to address a letter to the bishop of Nova Scotia, upon a subject which had nothing whatever to do with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, as the bishop's income was not derived from any grant to the Society by the public. He tells the bishop, that the public will judge him to be a man who was so crafty, and so practised in the art of duplicity, that he was acting the part of a madman or a devil. "It will require," he says, "the utmost exertion of your abilities in the art; of dis-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0632"/>
<col>1249</col>
simulation to set people against me." Was this the language of a peaceable man, a preacher of the gospel, to his superior? The rev. gentleman continues:&#x2014;"I must exhort you to repent of your enormous guilt, so contrary to law, reason, justice, and the gospel of Christ. At this time, perhaps, this warning will be in vain, while you are puffed up with worldly pride and ignorance. Tremble at the thunder of the Most High God, with whom there is no respect of persons;&#x2014;prepare for the thunder." Could the House think of instituting inquiries upon the allegations of such a man?&#x2014;The case of the rector of Saint Paul's had been adduced as a proof of the mismanagement of the funds of the Society. It was urged, that the rector was at the same time a Missionary. It was to be inferred, from this, that the duties which he had to perform as Missionary were distinct from those of his rectory. But the rectory produced him nothing; for although it had attached to it a glebe land, that glebe yielded nothing; and if the unfortunate rector was not assisted by the Society, he would be left without any remuneration for the discharge of the parochial duties as rector.&#x2014;Mr. Griffin complained, that the Society was disposed to employ as Missionaries those whom this rev. gentleman is pleased to call natives. One would suppose from the manner in which he treated those people, that they were inhabitants of a savage country. They were, however, fellow subjects, born in that country, and educated at the College of Windsor, in Nova Scotia, and for which the Education Society had granted small sums, for the purpose of inducing young men to be educated as clergymen; and it was the practice of the Society to select such individuals, rather than exercise their patronage by the appointment to the church of persons brought up at home. It was true that many might wish that none should be appointed to missions except persons educated at Oxford and Cambridge; but the views which the Society had taken were more liberal and just. The noble lord had, he thought, totally failed to make out any case which could justify a reference of the petition to a committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01064"><member>The Bishop of London</member><membercontribution> said, he would deny that he had evinced any disposition to shelter the Society from an inquiry into the distribution of its funds. He had never said any thing of the kind. He
<col>1250</col>
would now make a few observations respecting what the petitioner had said relative to the 50<i>l</i>. or 100<i>l</i>. offered to him as an inducement not to bring the subject of his petition before the public. He (the bishop) had received a letter from an eminent clergyman of the Established Church, which was conclusive on the subject: he alluded to archdeacon Pott. The archdeacon stated how he came to have any communication with Mr. Griffin, and what was the purport of all that had ever passed between them. The archdeacon had had his attention called to what had been stated in the House of Lords, respecting his having offered 50<i>l</i>. or 100<i>l</i>. to Mr. Griffin, in order to induce him to stop all further proceedings relative to his appeal against the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The archdeacon said, in his letter, that Mr. Griffin came to his house at Kensington, between seven and eight o'clock on Sunday evening, he never having seen him before. He had declined entering into Mr. Griffin's statement, which he had been desirous of making, but he observed to him, that from the intemperate language he had made use of in his letters, every body would feel convinced that the Society did well in getting rid of him. Mr. Griffin then replied, "Was there no door left open for repentance or apology?" The archdeacon rejoined, that there was, if he wished to make one. At the next meeting of the committee of the Society, he related what had passed between him and Mr. Griffin, and he wished that an apology might be accepted by the Society. On the Monday, Mr. Griffin called on him again, when he told him that if he made a proper apology, the committee might recommend his case to the attention of the Society. A hundred pounds were mentioned as the utmost that he could hope to receive from the Society; but it was impressed upon his mind, that whatever sum he did receive, the principal object would be to place him on a better footing with the Society, especially in relation to his future prospects. He added, that if Mr. Griffin imagined that in making the proposal, he was influenced by fear, or any apprehension of exposure, or desire of concealment or suppression of any statement injurious to the Society, he (Mr. Griffin) acted most unfairly towards one who intended all he did merely as a kindness to him. Mr. Griffin made no reply. He never said that his petition
<image src="S2V0018P0I0633"/>
<col>1251</col>
was to be presented to the House that evening. The right rev. prelate concluded by observing, that the letter of the archdeacon completely refuted what had been said respecting any desire to induce Mr. Griffin to suppress any charge he might conceive himself able to bring against the Society.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01065"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> said, he had not given any guarantee for the good temper of Mr. Griffin; indeed, he could not have done any thing of the sort, for he had never seen him but once. All he had stated of the rev. gentleman's character was, that he possessed a certificate of the inhabitants of Bridgetown in his favour. The manner in which he had been treated by the House had not evinced the best possible temper on the part of their lordships. The course taken against him was not by any means unprecedented; for whenever a person appealed to the House for redress, or attacked a public body upon public principles, the course of the ministerial bench was, to use every exertion to blacken his character. But much less turned upon the character of the petitioner than the opposite side wished to believe. He (lord King) had said, that the rector of Halifax was an ecclesiastical commissary and a missionary, The noble earl replied, that this assertion was true, but that the rector got nothing from his parish, for his glebe yielded nothing, But this assertion was not correct; for although the rector got nothing from the glebe, he received between four and five hundred pounds a year from his pew rents and other parochial fees. The rectory was, in fact, a valuable church preferment. It was a decided misapplication of the funds of the Society, to bestow any additional gifts on a clergyman in possession of such preferment. The Society was instituted for far different objects; and its real friends would feel sorry if its funds were to be so applied. The right rev. prelate had said, that the Society did not decline the investigation; but the right rev. bishop bad declined it for them, and the result was the same. He begged to say, that he did not rest his motion upon the petition, but upon the ground of what had fallen from the right reverend prelate, that the money of the Society was wasted, by being bestowed upon persons already provided for.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EAST RETFORD DISFRANCHISEMENT<lb/> BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01067">The order of the day being read,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01068"><member>Mr. Tennyson</member><membercontribution> stated, that he rose to move that this bill be re-committed. He understood his hon. friend's purpose was, to move an Instruction to the Committee; if so, it was clear that such motion would be irregular until the House had resolved to go into a committee, and after the demonstration made by his hon. friend it might be expedient for him (Mr. T.) to explain the course which, in his judgment, ought to be followed in the further discussion of this bill. That discussion would naturally divide itself into three distinct parts. The first question was, "whether sufficient evidence of the Corruption of the Borough of East Retford had been produced, to justify the interference of parliament?" This question he conceived would be decided in the affirmative by the House resolving to go into a committee on the bill, and should be so decided before his hon. friend's proposition could be entertained. This was his apology for interrupting his hon. friend. The second question was, "What should be the measure of that interference?" This would have to be determined in the committee, subject to any instruction which it might receive from the House, and he understood the object of that to be moved by his hon. friend was, to limit the measure of such interference. This imposed upon him (Mr. T.) the duty of stating more distinctly than he should otherwise have deemed necessary, the position to which the borough of East Retford was reduced by the evidence before the House, in order to shew that no measure of interference short of utter disfranchisement could meet the justice of this case. He should however abstain from offering, at present, any observations on the third point for discussion; namely, "the ulterior disposition of the franchise in case East Retford should be deprived of it,"&#x2014;as he was anxious to observe that delicacy which the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Secretary Peel) had recommended on this subject before it was decided, that the borough should in fact be disfranchised, but he trusted that the House would allow him the earliest opportunity for stating his views respecting it, when the proper period should arrive. If, after the ample
<image src="S2V0018P0I0634"/>
<col>1253</col>
time and the facilities which had been at forded to him for establishing the facts upon which the ultimate result of the present proceeding was to depend, he should fail in satisfying the House that his proofs were sufficient for the end he had proposed, blame would, beyond all doubt, be justly attributable to him, for not having redeemed that pledge upon which the House had consented to suspend the writ and allowed him to summon witnesses to the bar. But if, on the other hand, a gross and flagrant abuse of a high public trust&#x2014;one upon which the very existence and vitality of the constitution itself might be said mainly to depend&#x2014;were exposed and ultimately corrected, he should, in addition to the gratitude he sincerely fell for the support he had received, have the satisfaction of reflecting that he had justified that support and the confidence which the House had been pleased to repose in him. The diligent and anxious attention which the House had paid to this investigation during its progress, rendered it unnecessary for him to go elaborately and minutely into its details, but circumstanced as he was, it would be expected of him,&#x2014;and seeing the purpose of his hon. friend the member for Hertfordshire,&#x2014;he felt it his duty, to present a summary of the case, so as to recall the principal points to the recollection of the House before it came to a decision.<lb/>
The charge against the borough of East Retford was, "that it had been a notorious, long-continued, and general practice for the electors, who voted for the successful candidates, to receive the sum of twenty guineas from each of them, so that those who voted for both the members returned had customarily received forty guineas for such exercise of their elective franchise." It was nearly eleven mouths since this charge had been preferred. Numerous petitions had in the mean time, been presented from the borough. They deprecated the interference of the House in a case where it did not proceed upon corruptions alleged to have taken place at the last election; they stated that the electors had made no previous bargain with the candidates; they insisted on the ancient charters of the borough&#x2014;but not one word of denial addressed to the main accusation was any where to be found. Neither had the bailiffs and burgesses who in compliance with their petition had been
<col>1254</col>
heard at the bar, availed themselves,&#x2014;although aided by one of the most distinguished counsel of the day&#x2014;of that, opportunity for attempting to disprove the facts charged. On the other hand those facts, thus uncontradicted, had been established in a manner which must have brought home to every gentleman's mind a moral conviction, that the corruption alleged had, as stated in the charge and in the preamble of the bill, been "notorious, long-continued, and general." The learned counsel at the bar in his able speech did not even affect to deny it, although, oil other grounds he had deprecated any further proceeding. Indeed the case was so distinctly and conclusively made out by a powerful and connected stream of evidence, that all denial must have been vain and futile. Although these payments of head-money had been made for a very long period, he (Mr. T.) had been satisfied not to commence anything like regular proof of such payment before 1807. It appeared by the evidence of Mr. Jonas Warrick, who was the nephew of Mr. Bettison the steward of the duke of Newcastle, that he was employed by his uncle to pay election-money in that year, and that he had gone round to a considerable body of the voters, and delivered them packets containing; money as a remuneration for their suffrages. The next election was in 1812. The payment of head-money was distinctly proved on that occasion by Mr. Hannam, the agent, and Mr. Pickup, the steward of Mr. Osbaldeston, who was then returned for Retford. Mr. Hannam had produced the original list from which these payments were made at Retford, the sums paid deviating in many instances from the usual amount, having been arranged upon a scale adapted to the degree of promptness with which the voters had offered their support. Mr. Pickup admitted that he actually paid the voters indicated to him by Mr. Hannam from that list. He (Mr. T.) would pass by all the minor details, but he could not quit the year 1812, without observing that the only instance in which any successful candidate ever appeared to have omitted the payment of head-money, occurred upon that occasion, when Mr. Osbaldeston's colleague, Mr. Marsh, made a memorable exception on his own behalf, and had never afterwards been seen at Retford. The hon. gentleman then proceeded to the following election of 1818, when Mr. Evans and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0635"/>
<col>1255</col>
Mr. Crompton were returned. With regard to the payment of election-money on the part of Mr. Crompton on this occasion, the House had the evidence of Mr. Fox, the clerk of Messrs. Foljambe's bank at Retford. He produced the bank book containing Mr. Crompton's account, from which it appeared that shortly after the election of 1818, that gentleman was charged with 2,840<i>l</i>. as "Sundries," and about the same time there was a corresponding entry of a payment on the part of Mr. Crompton to the firm, of 2,800<i>l</i>. Mr. Fox, after much fencing, stated, most reluctantly, an impression on his memory that this money had been paid to one Westby Leadbetter (now dead) for distribution amongst the voters. This witness appeared so unwilling to give distinct testimony, that the House declared him guilty of a wilful suppression of the truth, and committed him to Newgate; but nevertheless the evidence extracted from him was such as to leave no doubt that the 2,840<i>l</i>. was paid to the electors; indeed the fact of election-money having been received by them at that period on behalf of Mr. Crompton was otherwise evidenced, as he should afterwards shew, and Samuel Buxton had stated before the Election committee that Westby Leadbeater was the individual who received it from the bank. The next head of evidence was applicable to the payments on the part of Mr. Evans in 1818 and also in 1820, when he and Mr. Crompton were again returned without opposition; what opposition, indeed, could have succeeded against gentlemen who so carefully complied with all good customs?&#x2014;This evidence was contained in the books of Mr. John Thornton, now dead, an Alderman of Retford, and the agent of Mr. Evans at those elections; they were produced by his respectable widow, and in them all the material transactions of her late husband, with Mr. Evans, in connection with his agency, were found recorded. They contained lists of all the burgesses in 1818 and 1820; lists designating such as had romised to vote for Mr. Evans in those years; regular cash accounts between him and his agent relating to each election, and the pay-list, or list from which burgesses residing in and near Retford, who had promised their votes, were actually paid in 1818. Those who had not promised could not, of course, be considered as entitled to the election-money. This
<col>1256</col>
pay-list of 1818, and the cash account of that year, named the individuals who were then paid the sum of 21<i>l</i>. each for their votes by the medium of Alderman John Thornton; two of the aldermen yet living did not appear to be included; but Mr. Alderman Clarke (as he himself admitted at the bar) had received 42<i>l</i>.; whether this double payment was made to him as an alderman or a plumper he did not state. From the list and the cash-account it appeared that all the other resident burgesses had received the usual gratuity except two, <i>who had not promised,</i> and except also&#x2014;an exception he was happy to mention&#x2014;the rev. Mr. Booth. To these he should add the name of Broxholme Slaney, who had promised, but, for some reason, did not appear to have been paid by Thornton. The name, however, of this voter appeared in the pay-list of 1812, and in 1818 he conveyed the money to his son George Slaney&#x2014;therefore the House must not imagine that he was to be classed with Mr. Booth. In all, there were paid in 1818, through Thornton, 128 rank and file, with the returning officer (Mr. Cottam) and Aldermen Clarke and Mason at the head. To meet this payment by Thornton, the cash-account shewed that Mr. Evans remitted to him 2,850<i>l</i>., about the same sum as had, for a similar purpose, been disbursed at that period by Mr. Fox for Mr. Crompton.<lb/>
He would now direct the attention of the House to the election of 1820. He could not produce Mr. Evans's pay-list for this year. It was not entered into Thornton's books; but a note in Thornton's writing-stated that there were "193 to pay" in 1820, as a similar note had stated that there were "148 to pay" in 1818. In fact, he found by Thornton's cash-account of 1820, that 155 voters were paid for voting in that year&#x2014;134 by himself and 21 by his principal, Mr. Evans, who for this purpose remitted 3,000<i>l</i>. to Thornton, and advanced 420<i>l</i>. more with his own hand. The number so paid, 155, constituted at all times a large majority of the electors, and this fact would, of itself, make out a sufficient case for the disfranchisement of the borough. He could not indeed specify by means of a pay-list (as he had in 1818) the individual voters who were so paid in 1820, except by the admissions of such as had been examined, neither could he shew that more than 155 out of the 193 were actually paid on this occasion; nor
<image src="S2V0018P0I0636"/>
<col>1257</col>
that more than 128 out of the 148 were so paid in 1818; but it must be recollected that out of four pay-lists, viz. one for each of the members in each of those years, he had only one&#x2014;-that of Mr. Evans for 1818&#x2014;and this only applied to the resident voters, and those in the immediate neighbourhood, who had been paid by Thornton himself. The outvoters would be paid through other channels; Mr. Evans had paid 21 himself in 1820; William Grant, in his examination at the bar, said he had once been paid by a stranger in London, and the House might, fairly arrive at the conclusion, that if it had been furnished with all these pay-lists, scarcely a single voter would be found exempt from corruption, except two or three who from their property and station could not have submitted to such degradation. So far the case stood upon the evidence of <i>payment</i> by members returned and their agents. In addition, and to support that evidence, the House had the admission of every person entitled to vote at former elections, who had been examined either at the bar, or on oath before the Select committee, except the unhappy and ill-advised William Lead-beater, who, having persisted in his denial of the charge, when the House was fully satisfied of its truth by other evidence, was expiating his obstinacy and falsehood in Newgate. This head of testimony went back even to 1796 when Richard Hodgkinson admitted that he received election-money, and the admissions of receipt by the other witnesses in every instance (except that of Lead-better) confirmed the evidence of payment as contained in the lists and accounts produced, and gave them an indisputable authority as applied to the case generally. These admissions ran through a series of elections up to the latest period. They were made by unwilling witnesses; but their testimony, when extracted, was on that ground, entitled to higher credit. Amongst them was Mr. Samuel Hindley, one of the bailiffs, and who would have to exercise the functions of a returning-officer, if an election at Retford were to take place to-morrow. Did his hon. friend, the member for Hertfordshire, mean to include this gentleman in his new elective body, and leave him to officiate when the next return was to be made? If not, could he much more securely fix upon any other individual at Retford unless it were the rev. Mr. Booth?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01069"><member>Mr. Brown</member><membercontribution>, the town-clerk, had endea-
<col>1258</col>
voured in the first instance, to intimate an opinion that the lower voters alone expected election-money. He says he so stated the matter to sir Henry Wright Wilson. It was more difficult to say who were not, than who were, the lower voters at Retford, as they were almost entirely persons in the most abject condition of life. However, among those lower voters, who had actually received election-money were, in the first place, Mr. Brown, the town-clerk, himself, Mr. Alderman Clark, Mr. Alderman Apple-by, Mr. Alderman Mason; Mr. Hindley, one of the present returning officers; Mr. Bailey, who would have been returning officer in 1827, and was a petitioner against this bill; Mr. George Hudson and Mr. John Dauber, the bailiffs and returning officers in 1826; Mr. Cottam, who was a returning officer in 1818; Mr. Hartshorn, a surgeon; and, as a counterpoise to the rev. Mr. Booth, he was sorry to name the rev. John Fell, as one of those lower voters who had consented to receive the wages of corruption. Mr. Brown, however, subsequently admits that there was at the last election, in 1826, <i>a general</i> expectation of election-money, except on the part of those who voted for sir Henry Wilson. He was the agent to that gentleman, and his reason for making this exception was, that, having staled to sir Henry Wilson, before he entered the town upon his canvass, that "the lower voters were expecting money," and sir Henry having replied, "My good fellow, I will say nothing about money&#x2014;I come here to do what is just and right," he (Mr. Brown) had, in a speech which he addressed to sir Henry's partizans at the Granby-inn, repeated the expressions which the discreet knight, like a practised and kilful electioneerer, had thus confided to his no less adroit agent, who must have well known what effect the announcement of sir Henry's determination to do what was "just and right," (an expression, he should afterwards shew, well understood within the Borough), would have upon any Retford-understanding, although this wary candidate declined, thus prematurely, "to say anything about money." If, in fact, Mr. Brown had really intended to impart to his audience that they must not indulge in pecuniary expectations from sir H. Wilson&#x2014;an intention which seems to have been quite unauthorized by that gentleman&#x2014;and which would have been as gratuitous as it appeared incredible on the part of his agent&#x2014;the English language
<image src="S2V0018P0I0637"/>
<col>1259</col>
would have furnished him with plain expressions for his communication. If his conscience called upon him to state anything, he should have stated it distinctly. Of course it could not, if understood, have propitiated the voters, but he might, in making an unequivocal disclosure of the truth, have qualified it by dwelling upon the other grounds which he pretends did influence them to give a disinterested vote. He might have said, "Gentlemen, I stand before you in a most painful and embarrassing situation; I find myself the unhappy agent of a candidate who proves to be so little sensible of what is due to you, to your good and ancient customs, to his own interest, as to have intimated that he has no intention of paying the election-money, if you should return him to parliament. Yet, notwithstanding this novel and disheartening circumstance, I implore you not to desert him, for he comes as the champion of our holy religion against the bigotry, the corruption, and the intolerance, of the church of Rome. Shew yourselves superior to all personal views when the constitution itself is in danger;&#x2014;throw yourselves between that constitution and the advocates of Popish Superstition&#x0021;&#x2014;It is to the Pope that sir Henry Wilson here presents himself as an opponent. Take this as an equivalent and compensation for the election-money, your undoubted and rightful inheritance, but which, on this occasion, and under such circumstances, I would induce you to wave."&#x2014;No such thing. Not one word of this.&#x2014;Hedid tell them that sir Henry Wilson would oppose Catholic emancipation, because he thought that would serve his cause; but, with respect to the election-money, this conscientious town-clerk limited himself to the information that sir Henry would do "what was just and right," and left his friends to draw their own inference; what that inference necessarily was, he afterwards himself informed the House, for during his last examination, after much parrying, he admitted that the expressions he used to the voters, unexplained, would be understood by the majority "to mean money," and, when he was asked, why he had not explained them, he replied, that he thought it his duty to confine himself to the expressions used by sir Henry Wilson. He (Mr. T.) had enlarged upon this matter; because the right hon. gentleman opposite (Mr. Peel) seemed in the first instance to attach im-
<col>1260</col>
portance to this part of Mr. Brown's testimony, but the House would perceive that it operated in a direction opposed to the impression which that witness had attempted to convey. It had been objected in the petitions, by the counsel at the bar, and by others, that the case before the House did not touch the last election. This, however, appeared to him to be a mere objection in form and none in substance; for, if he shewed that the present condition of the borough was such as to render it unfit to retain the elective franchise, he submitted that he had proved a case to support the preamble of the bill. But, if necessary, he could have answered the challenge contained in that objection. The House had seen what the town-clerk (Mr. Brown) said, as to the general expectation of money at the last election in 1826&#x2014;the town-clerk, an unwilling witness, who, except upon compulsion, had declined to give testimony, and who, from his official position and connection with parties in the borough, was in every way interested and disposed to maintain its credit. He might have referred to the treating which had been carried on at the last election to an extent quite unparalleled: it had been employed for nearly a year prior to, and throughout, the election; the town was thus kept in a state of continual intoxication and disorder. When thus inflamed and besotted by liquor, the excitement attendant upon the crisis of the election contest, produced riots of the most frightful and destructive nature, by which the peaceable inhabitants were thrown into a state of consternation and just alarm for their lives and property. It had even become necessary to send for and employ a body of regular cavalry to suppress them; and when this interference of a military force was complained of as an unconstitutional proceeding, the committee deemed it, under the circumstances, not only justifiable, but so indispensable, that they voted the petition urging that complaint, to be frivolous and vexatious. He might have thrown light upon a scene at the Vine public house, shortly before the last election, where Mr. George Thornton, an alderman of Retford, and agent for one of the candidates, was discovered administering sovereigns out of a canvas bag to several voters, who were called one by one into a private room where he was sitting with the blind drawn down. He might equally have referred to a variety of other
<image src="S2V0018P0I0638"/>
<col>1261</col>
evidence before the select committee, of general corruption at the last election, but he preferred dealing with the testimony delivered at the bar as that upon which gentlemen could best exercise their own judgment. That testimony would conclusively show, not only that the borough had been corrupt, but that it was now in so corrupted a state that it must be altogether disfranchised. If, while he was endeavouring to satisfy the House of this, his hon. friend, the member for Hertfordshire, would do him the honour to follow him, he would find that there was no wholesome residue of voters, no sound nucleus, round which, and for the sake of which, he either could or ought to construct a new constituent body; and if he (Mr. T.) proved that, he conceived there was an end of his hon. friend's proposal. Mr. Brown, the town-clerk, had stated, that he believed there were now forty resident burgesses who had never received the election-money. That there were forty in 1818, and forty in 1820. This was the very statement to suit his hon. friend, and it had appeared to make a considerable impression. As he knew it to be ill founded, he had felt it his duty to counteract it by means of Mr. Brown himself. Accordingly, he had put into that witness's hands, lists of the voters in 1818, 1820, and 1826, and desired him to mark the forty pure resident voters in each of those lists. His right hon. friend (Mr. Williams Wynn) had at the time objected to this description of evidence as inconclusive, but he would now find it very conclusive for the object he had in view, for thence it appeared, upon the evidence of the town-clerk himself, that there was no remnant of pure voters to justify the proposal of his hon. friend (Mr. N. Culvert), and therefore, that the franchise must be entirely removed. The result of the operation was; this:&#x2014;In attempting to mark his forty pure men upon the whole list of 1818, the town-clerk could, in fact, only find twentyseven. Then he was to have marked resident voters. But first he had marked twelve non-residents, as to whom, the House and: Mr. Brown knew, he had no pay-list; one of them appeared to be dead, and eight others of these non-resident voters had not, according to the promise-list, engaged their votes to Mr. Evans, and could not, therefore, be entitled to their money. Then, he had marked the rev. Mr. Booth, the well-known exception, to which he had,
<col>1262</col>
with pleasure, already referred. Next he had selected a man who had no vote in 1818, but this was Mr. George Thornton, who had figured with the canvas bag, and otherwise, in 1826. Then he came to five others who were dead, of whom one was John Thornton, the agent who paid the money for Mr. Evans in 1818 and 1820, and three others who had not promised. Next Mr. Brown had unluckily stumbled upon three who had been actually paid,&#x2014;one of them, a very natural mistake,&#x2014;the rev. John Fell. Thus he had disposed of twenty-five out of the twenty-seven marked. Two remained; and he must admit that, against these two he had no proof, but it must always be recollected that he had only one pay-list, from which his proofs could be drawn.&#x2014;With regard to the list of voters in 1820, Mr. Brown, instead of forty had only been able to select twenty-three;&#x2014;one clergyman (Mr. Booth);&#x2014;eight non-residents;&#x2014;-two resident, but who had not promised;&#x2014;five dead;&#x2014;two paid;&#x2014;leaving five unimpeached; but there was no pay-list for 1820, although from J. Thornton's book alone, one hundred and fifty-five appear to have received. In 1826, which is the most important list to attend to for present purposes, exclusively of the burgesses admitted since 1820, Mr. Brown had only ventured to name nineteen persons, instead of the forty resident voters he had spoken of. These nineteen were made up of eight out-voters;&#x2014;two who were nonresident in 1818 (the year as to which the only pay-list applied);&#x2014;one, the rev. Mr. Booth;&#x2014;one,George Thornton, the corrupt agent of 1826;&#x2014;two dead;&#x2014;one paid in 1818, one who had not promised in 1818, and three others whom he (Mr. T.) could not impeach, and to whom no other observation applied, except that he had only one of the many pay-lists. But in order to give the House the clearest idea of the result of the whole of the evidence, he had prepared a full list of the present voters for East Retford. Opposite to the name of each of them in any manner affected by the evidence, was stated the bearing of that evidence upon the individual. This list he would place upon the table, in order that any member might examine it for his own satisfaction. It seemed the fairest manner of presenting the case to the scrutiny of the House. The whole result, was, that excluding the burgesses admitted since 1820, (who had no opportunity of receiving head-money)
<image src="S2V0018P0I0639"/>
<col>1263</col>
the evidence affected a large majority of the whole number, resident and non-resident;&#x2014;the whole of the present resident voters who were voters in 1818, except six; and all the others, except five, who were admitted freemen between 1818 and 1820. The number of resident voters was stated at one hundred and four. The whole number of electors exceeded two hundred; but thus tried and sifted, he was justified in maintaining, that the borough was, at this moment, in so corrupted a state, that his hon. friend could not fix upon five or three individuals on whose behalf he could wish to save it, or round whom he could form a new body of electors, with any sort of security that they were not polluted by the corrupt practice proved against the others; unless, indeed, he proposed to adopt, as the centre of his new franchise, the young burgesses who had never had an opportunity of availing themselves of the custom, and thus place them over the heads of their fathers, and masters, and elders in the town. After the statement which he (Mr. T.) had thus deduced from the evidence, was it not absurd to say that the proofs did not come up to the last election? Was it not a mere pretext for defeating his object? When such was the present condition of the borough, could any man doubt that, if the gentlemen returned in 1826 had retained their seats, or if this inquiry had not intervened and others had been elected, the usual gratuity would have been paid on the one hand, and received on the other, as matter of course and custom, by the young, as well as the old voters? He would ask any member who heard him&#x2014;except his hon. and gallant friend (sir Robert Dundas) whom he was most happy to see again in the House representing another borough&#x2014;whether it was possible to form any other opinion, unless a miracle had changed the hereditary disposition of the freemen of Retford? Even if the town-clerk had not stated their general expectation in 1826 that the ancient custom would be complied with, it would have been utterly impossible to imagine, unless they were constituted differently from other human beings, that such expectation should not have prevailed universally, after an immemorial usage, only departed from in one single instance&#x2014;the instance so constantly and readily recurred to by the witnesses&#x2014;that of the immortal Mr. Marsh,&#x2014;for immorcal he would be as long as Retford remained a borough,&#x2014;and whose
<col>1264</col>
conscientious conduct in 1812 would have been rewarded by the crown of martrydom if he had ever again ventured within the walls of Retford, where the fate of St. Stephen doubtless awaited him. It seemed absurd to resort to any thing like testimony on this head, but there was in fact abundant proof that at the last election no idea existed that the custom was to be abandoned. Gyles and Palfreman, William Jackson, and Hindley, on oath before the select committee, and Hindley again at the bar, deposed, that in 1826 the hope of receiving the election-money was distinctly held out, even in the public houses, by George Thornton, the agent, upon his canvass. Well acquainted with all the electors and knowing the mode in which he could best operate on their minds, he employed this as the most direct road to their favour on behalf of his principal. William Brown was canvassed with the assurance of the forty guineas by John Taylor;&#x2014;Francis White, and others, before the select committee, gave similar evidence. The letter written by G. Thornton's direction to Joseph Marshall [printed in the Minutes of Evidence before the Select Committee, p. 68.] was to the same effect. Then came the evidence of Bux-ton and Baker, that Mr. Foljambe had canvassed them with the assurance that it would be "all right" if they would vote as he wished them at the last election&#x2014;an expression explained as referring to the right and due payment of the election-money. There was a variety of such evidence on the Minutes. Finally came the town-clerk, who had himself received the election-money in 1818 and 1820&#x2014;who in 1826 informed sir Henry Wilson of the expectation which prevailed, and who communicated to the voters in his interest the worthy knight's reply, that" he came to do what was just and right." His learned friend, the Common Sergeant, when he so ably defended the interests of the burgesses at the bar, had said that this proceeding on his (Mr. Tennyson's) part, was altogether unprecedented, in as much as in the former cases, where parliament had interfered to regulate or to disfranchise, the corruptions on which the proceedings had been founded were uniformly corruptions charged to have occurred at the last election, and were so recited in the several acts of parliament. Knowing his learned friend's great accuracy, he might have relied upon it; however, he had referred to the acts,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0640"/>
<col>1265</col>
and to the proceedings which led to them, and found that for once his learned friend was mistaken. In the Shoreham case, the evidence applied to a Society, mis-called the "Christian Society," which had carried on corrupt practices for a series of years, but was not charged with interference at the last election. Mr. Rumbold, who was not returned at the election, the returning officer having objected to the votes tendered on his behalf by the members of this society, was seated on petition, when it appeared that the association was dissolved prior to the election. Accordingly, the Shoreham act did not recite, as had been imagined by his learned friend, that the corruptions on which it proceeded existed at the last election. Again in the recent case, a case of absolute transfer from the borough of Grampound to the county of York, the corruption, for which disfranchisement was inflicted, took place, not at the last election, but sometime before the election which preceded the last. It had been matter of complaint by those who opposed the measure that the corruption was not recent, but had taken place several years before. So in this case again, the act, instead of reciting corruption at the last election, stated that it occurred prior to the election of the members returned to the preceding parliament; in fact there had been two intervening general elections. Thus, so far from being precedents against him, the cases of Shoreham and Grampound were precedents in his favour. But, if parliament thought it right to interfere in those cases, how much more loudly was it called upon to do so here. As a case for mere regulation, by admitting the freeholders of the hundred to vote, the state of East Ret-ford presented no similitude to those, of Shoreham, Cricklade and Aylesbury, where that course had been adopted, and went much beyond the case of the borough of Grampound, which had been visited with entire disfranchisement. At Shoreham, in 1771, there were one hundred and twenty eight voters, of whom sixty-eight were disqualified by act of parliament, leaving sixty, or nearly half, unimpeached. At Cricklade there were two hundred and forty voters, of whom eighty-three were convicted of bribery; forty-three others were charged, but the charges were not pursued;&#x2014;suppose these, also, to be guilty, still there were one hundred and fourteen unimpeached. At Aylesbury, in 1804,
<col>1266</col>
there were four hundred and seventeen voters, fifty-seven were convicted of corruption; it was said there was moral proof against two hundred; still there were two hundred and seventeen, or a majority of pure voters. In each of these cases there was something like half the whole number untainted, and out of consideration for this untainted portion, it was thought right and expedient to preserve the borough, taking, as a security against future corruption, the infusion of a large additional number of electors. The source from which they were derived was one suggested by the convenience of neighbourhood, and not by any claim on the part of the hundred or district in which the borough was situated; such a claim was never thought of. Even at Grampound, the number of voters was sixty-two; twenty-four were convicted; six others were charged, but the proceedings stayed;&#x2014;suppose thirty to have been guilty&#x2014;at any rate there were thirty-two&#x2014;a majority&#x2014;untouched.&#x2014;Yet, in that case, the true principle&#x2014;that the elective franchise is a trust, and not a private possession,&#x2014;was at length acted upon, and the borough was entirely disfranchised without regard to the residuary voters. But in the case of East Retford, where his hon. friend wished to recur to the old practice, he must first point out the parties for whom this was to be done, and who were to be the pure centre of the future constituent body. So far from being able, as in the other cases cited, to lay his hand upon half the former voters as unimpeached, he could not name a quarter, nor an eighth, nor a sixteenth, nor a twentieth, nor any minor fraction, with the least security, that the individuals he might fix upon were really such as ought to retain the franchise. The town-clerk fancied he could fix upon forty pure men; he tried, but tried in vain; he had named nineteen, but they had proved to be men of straw.<lb/>
He was sorry that his duty had compelled him to detain the House so long. He should now sit down with the conviction that parliament would deal properly with this case, and would not, by adopting an ulterior measure, at once useless, anomalous, and absurd, leave him under the painful feeling that, instead of procuring, as he had proposed, a substantial benefit for his country, he had been blindly labouring to add one more to a bundle of eccentric precedents, which almost in any case would be faulty
<image src="S2V0018P0I0641"/>
<col>1267</col>
in principle and futile in practice, but which were totally inapplicable to the condition of East Retford. It would, moreover, be a wanton waste of a valuable privilege, which other important communities were most anxious to obtain, to bestow it upon a district already represented, and where it was neither asked for nor desired; while such a disposition of it would painfully disappoint the real necessities, and reasonable expectations of the country. The hon. gentleman concluded by moving, that the bill be re-committed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01070"><member>Mr. George Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, he considered; the evidence not sufficient to justify the House in taking steps so strong or severe as those to which the hon. gentleman had directed their attention. He did not deny that there was some matter that deserved the consideration of the House; but the proof of corruption had been brought home to so few electors, that he could not consent either to the proposition of the hon. gentleman, or the mitigated proposition which the House was led to expect from the hon. gentleman (Mr. N. Calvert) behind him. On a former night he had called for further evidence; but finding the temper of the House against him, he had yielded to it. Though he had no right to assume the character of advocate for the borough of East Retford, he was desirous that it should receive no injury at his hands. He felt himself in the condition of a judge, who, by the rules of our criminal courts, was bound to act as counsel for the accused, when he had no other defender. He disagreed wholly with the hon. gentleman, in his view of the two cases of Shoreham and Grampound. In both those cases, the inquiries which had ended in the disfranchisement of the boroughs originated with petitions against the returns at the last election. On opposing the disfranchisement of Shoreham, Mr. Fox made the first display of his eloquence in that House; and in twenty-two years afterwards, in 1793, that great man, in opposing the proceedings against Stockbridge, referred to his exertions in the case of Shoreham, and re-stated the same objections in principle. Mr. Fox styled it a bill of pains and penalties, and said, that except on the clearest evidence, he would not deprive any borough of its rights and privileges. In the case of Grampound it was equally certain, that the bill for disfranchising that borough had originated in the proceedings of the
<col>1268</col>
last election. On the report of the committee the law officers of the Crown were directed to proceed criminally against certain parties suspected to be guilty of bribery and corruption. Now, the House knew these parties could not have been prosecuted if their offences had been committed two years before. Yet, not only were criminal informations filed against them, but at the assizes thirty-four bills of indictment were found against other parties, of whom no less than twenty-four were convicted. Besides, what was the state of that borough? A witness who had been employed as agent in one of the elections, stated at the bar of this House, that he believed there were very few electors indeed who would not accept the bribes&#x2014;only two or three at the utmost. The same witness stated, too, that he had been present at a meeting of the electors some time previous to the election, at which the principal persons belonging to the borough attended. At this meeting it was resolved, that the sum of 8,000<i>l</i>. should be asked as the price of their votes; and this resolution was moved by the mayor of Grampound, in the presence of the aldermen and chief people of the place. Yet this borough was not disfranchised until the parties accused had had the benefit of a trial by jury. In all the preceding cases, he contended, the legislature had proceeded on principles essentially different from those applied to the case before the House.&#x2014;The hon. gentleman then went into the evidence, particularly those parts of it which related to Hannam and Thornton, and contended that enough was not made out by it to justify the House in taking the step proposed by the hon. member. There were certainly no established precedents on which they could act, but against such evidence as that which had been offered to the House he felt it to be his duty to protest. There was no party in that House&#x2014;-no set of men who wished to encourage and support corruption; but he thought that every one was bound to call for the best evidence that could be procured, and he did not think that they had yet got at it in this case. He granted that enough had been adduced to shew that it was a suspicious case, but there were very few instances in which conviction had been brought home; and without that, the House would not be justified in passing an act of disfranchisement; nor indeed, in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0642"/>
<col>1269</col>
proceeding a step further, unless the hon. gentleman should admit that the present evidence was inadequate, and that fresh and better evidence ought to be brought forward. It appeared to him that the hon. gentleman had been taking too much care of his case; he had in a manner overlaid his child; and it certainly had been a matter of surprise to him, that, after such great pretensions, so little had really been accomplished. In the preamble to his bill, the hon. gentleman stated, that what he called for was founded on matter of public and general notoriety; and he therefore supposed the hon. gentleman was content to rest his case on that notoriety alone, without diving any deeper into the merits of the case. But if the borough was really so corrupt, as had been represented, how was it possible to believe that one of the most respected noblemen in England, earl Fitzwilliam, would have been anxious for a relation of his, sir R. Dundas, to have the honour of representing the borough? And yet such was the case, as had been over and over again stated.<lb/>
Besides, if it was base and sordid in those who received the packets of money for distribution among the burgesses, how much more base and sordid was it in those who supplied the contents of those packets, and sent them down to East Retford, where they were placed not only in the hands of the electors, but in those of their wives and daughters, who were of course more open to temptation? For these reasons he should oppose the bill, as it stood at present, and he trusted that the House would pause before they agreed to pass it into a law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01071"><member>Lord. Howick</member><membercontribution> said, that he looked upon this bill as a penal one, and his principle was not to consent to capital punishment, unless for the purpose of getting rid altogether of a crime. But would such be the case in this instance? He, for one, would say, that, under the present constitution of the House of Commons, bribery in borough elections was neither disgraceful nor blameable. Every body must see that, on the principle on which boroughs were now carried on, the self-interest of the electors was the point always consulted; and while such was the fact, it mattered not; whether their vote was paid for in money, or in situations under government, or in East-India patronage, or in letting out lands to them at a price below their value. In fact, there was scarcely a mem-
<col>1270</col>
ber in that House, except such as were returned for very populous places, who could say that his return did not proceed from the selfish interests of the electors. While things were in this state, therefore, he could not blame the burgesses of East Retford; it was that House that was guilty and not the electors; and, until some remedy was determined on by the House itself, he thought they would be acting wisely in ceasing to make this vain parade about, any one particular borough. The question, however, for the House to consider was, whether the electors of East Retford were the most proper persons to exercise the elective franchise or not? The House was not to look at this question as a jury would look at it; but as members of parliament, merely considering whether it was a case of political expediency; and, as far as that point was concerned, he contended that it had been sufficiently made out in evidence that they had no claim to such a privilege. In conclusion, he should certainly support the bill as it was framed at present; but if an alteration, which he understood was about to be proposed, should be carried into effect, he should oppose it. Those members who were returned for towns and cities were the really popular members, in the proper acceptation of the word; he thought them more so even than county members; and he therefore thought that, if the borough itself was disfranchised, the privilege of returning members ought to be removed to some considerable town.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01072"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> thought the evidence so full and complete, that what had fallen from the hon. gentleman who had spoken last but one had been matter of astonishment to him. His remarks could only have been made under the influence of the most inveterate prejudice or error. The evidence upon which the bill was supported seemed to be as perfect as the House could possibly desire. Nothing could be more consistent than the statement of the gentleman and his clerk; and he had never in the whole course of his life seen any paper drawn up with more nicety, or greater mercantile precision, than the list which was before the House with the names of the voters who had received money for their services. It was a Complete balance-sheet, stating with the greatest precision, the sums received and paid, and to whom those payments were made. He ought, indeed, almost to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0643"/>
<col>1271</col>
ask pardon of the House for attempting to say a single word in support of such testimony; as he was satisfied that no one who heard it could have the slightest doubt of the general corruption which prevailed in the borough. With respect to the disposal of the franchise, he might in the first place observe, that the rights which those persons held were merely in trust for the benefit of the public, and when they did those things which laid them open to a forfeiture, the public had a right to resume those rights for the good of the whole community, and to bestow them upon any other place or persons who might be best qualified to receive them.&#x2014;The worthy alderman then proceeded to contend, that there had been already too many departures from the principles of the constitution. Every one pretended to maintain the theory of those principles; but could any man presume to declare that they were not grossly violated in practice? Lord Chatham, more than fifty years ago, had declared, that the constitution was no longer in practical existence. Upon one occasion that great man had said, that "whoever understood any thing of the theory of the British constitution, and would compare that theory with the fact, would see how widely they differed from each other;" and he went on to say, "Will any man affirm that the constitution now exists? it exists in no degree. It is destroyed." It was the duty of the House to endeavour to return to those principles; and the first step was, to free the system of representation from such blots as were exhibited in the case of the borough of East Retford. He believed there was but one opinion as to the propriety of disfranchising that borough; and he confessed himself astonished that any member could be found to offer any objection to that measure. The question was, to what place were they to remove the elective franchise now possessed by East Retford? He was one of those who thought that the liberties of the country mainly rested upon the purity of the system of representation. He never had been a theorist. He had never, at any period of his life, been an advocate for universal suffrage; but he wished, he confessed, to see the elective franchise more widely extended among the people, and individuals sent to the House of Commons with less expense, instead of paying 4 or 5,000<i>l</i>. for their seat. There might, it was true, be
<col>1272</col>
some persons to whom the expenditure of that sum was a matter of no consequence; and who might, he would not say from vanity, but from a desire to keep up their rank and support their dignity in a county, squander large sums upon an election, but he objected to the principle of any sum being paid for a seat in that House, to be afterwards repaid, upon the condition of giving a profligate vote for increasing the burthens of the people. It was notorious, that vast numbers of the members of that House were men who never, in the whole course of their lives, could bring their minds to the expenditure of a single pound for which they did not entertain a fair expectation of receiving two-and-twenty shillings in return. Could it be for an instant supposed by any one at all acquainted with human nature, that these men would all on a sudden determine upon spending four or five thousand pounds for a seat in that House, unless they expected to reap some adequate advantage from that expenditure of their capital? He knew that there had been a time when the House would not have listened to any suggestions of any improper motive in those who were sent to that House. He knew there had been times when the language they had heard on this bill would not have been listened to by the House; but the facts were now known and acknowledged, and although all admitted the corruption, they were slow in applying any remedy. He believed, indeed, that the opinion most prevalent among some members was, that the electors of East Retford had not been dexterous enough in concealing their practice, while others only felt alarm for the situation in which they themselves might be placed. The question, however, was not so much whether the disfranchisement should take place, as to what place the right should be transferred; and he was happy to learn that, from what had taken place, the hon. gentleman near him had abandoned his intention of proposing that it should be transferred to the hundred. What right, indeed, he would boldly ask, had the hundred to obtain that privilege? Why should the inhabitants of the hundred, already possessing a vote for the county of Nottingham, be allowed to return two members for that part in which East Retford was situated, when there were so many and such large and populous places throughout the kingdom which had no right to send members at all. Why should
<image src="S2V0018P0I0644"/>
<col>1273</col>
they have that right of representation doubled, when a town like Birmingham, with a hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants, was wholly unrepresented? In looking at the situation of Birmingham, thus unrepresented, and yet subject to all the acts of the government, and liable to all the extent of its taxation, he might use the memorable expression of lord Camden, "That taxation without representation is tyranny; and that no government had a right to impose taxes without the consent of those upon whom they were to be levied, expressed through their representatives;" and he believed that great man added, that "they who attempt to raise taxes without the consent of a representative, attempted a robbery." If they wished to make the theory of the government accordant with its practice, they must confer upon Birmingham, Manchester, and the other large towns, the right of sending representatives to that House, to express the opinions and support the interests of their constituents. He should wish to see ministers taking the lead upon questions like that now before the House. Instead of yielding, as they did in the case of the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts, to the imperious voice of the people, he should wish to see them come forward like men, and take that lead which their situation imposed upon them in the work of improvement. The right turn, gentleman (Mr. Peel), when he came forward with the tardy concession, on that occasion, had talked a good deal of policy; but he thought, for his own part, that honesty, to use the homely phrase, would be always found to be the best policy; and he repeated, that he wished to see the government come forward with the proposition for transferring the right to Manchester or Birmingham. They had often heard that the present system worked well. It would lead him much beyond those bounds which would be agreeable to the House [hear, hear &#x0021;], if he attempted to shew how the system really had worked; but he might be permitted to observe, that however well it might have worked for some persons, it had worked very ill for the people. There was one argument, however, connected with the population, that he could not pass over. The present system of the representation was settled at the Revolution, when the population did not at the utmost, amount to more than five millions. Now, the
<col>1274</col>
two kingdoms, including the principality of Wales, had nearly fifteen millions of inhabitants. He would ask, then, whether the system of representation which was then considered adequate to the wants of five millions of people, at a time too when the whole expenditure of the country was not more than two millions, and the debt merely nominal, could be now considered applicable to a population of fifteen millions, with an expenditure of 50,000,000<i>l</i>. and a debt of 800,000,000<i>l</i>.? Could any man consider that the system settled at the Revolution was a system fit for the present circumstances, when, upon a fair computation, nine tenths of the members of the House were returned from places of little or no importance? Gatton, for instance, had only one house, and yet it sent two members; and old Sarum had not even a single House. He recollected hearing at one time an amusing story upon the subject of the borough of Gatton. It appeared that there was a public-house in the place, and the proprietor of the borough, fearing that some adventuring politician might bribe the landlord, and so endanger his interest in Gatton, took the first opportunity which offered, upon the House becoming vacant, to advertise it to be let, with the condition that no proposal could be received, except from a woman; in order, he supposed, to avoid the danger of having a vote in the borough. There were many boroughs in the same situation; and so convinced was he of the futility and injustice of adding to this imperfect state of representation, by giving the right to the Hundred, that if it was proposed to dispose of the right in that way, he should feel it to be his duty to vote for the borough remaining as it is now; in the hope, that by the corruption being allowed to go on, it would effect its own cure, and bring on that correction which the people have in vain supplicated the House to bestow upon it. To take a specimen of the representation&#x2014;the county of Cornwall returned forty-four members to that House, while sixteen other counties returned only forty-three members in all, exclusive of those who sat for the counties. Could it be said that this was a fair representation of the people?&#x2014;and the more so, if they took into their consideration the number who were returned by the influence of the members of the other House of Parliament. In Cornwall, there were only two hundred and fifty
<image src="S2V0018P0I0645"/>
<col>1275</col>
thousand inhabitants to return forty-four members; while the towns of Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, and Halifax, contained above four hundred and fifty thousand, and were wholly unrepresented. The whole of the actual voters for the county of Cornwall and all its boroughs was not, he believed, more than two thousand. He had been returned to parliament by the votes of five thousand and forty-one of his fellow citizens, not one vote having cost him even a shilling. The worthy alderman repeated his determination to vote for the franchise remaining with the inhabitants of East Retford, unless it were transferred to some populous town; and asked the House to state what it feared from giving the inhabitants of Birmingham such a right? Did they mean to say, that the people of Birmingham ought not to be trusted to exercise such a right? If they gave any reason why they should not be represented, be was prepared to give many why they should not be taxed. Give them, he would say, a fair trial, and see whether they were fit to be allowed the exercise of their constitutional right; for to say that they had not such a constitutional right was contrary to the principles of the constitution and a libel upon that constitution and those who lived under its protection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01073"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> thought that the question now before the House; namely, the disfranchisement of the borough of East Retford, involved considerations of a general nature, nearly similar to those which were connected with the other question of the disfranchisement of Penryn. The first question was that of the measure of justice to be dealt out to the borough; the second involved the consideration of the policy and expediency of disposing of the vacant franchise either to the hundred, or to some populous town. For even supposing the delinquency of the borough to be partly made out, and that enough was proved to justify the forfeiture of the franchise, the question to be considered was, not to what place it might be just, but to what place it might be also politic and expedient, to transfer that right. He proposed to consider, first, the justice of the proceeding itself, and next, whether or not there had been a sufficiency of evidence to warrant any interference with the elective right of the borough which had been accused. And first, with respect to the question of justice. In approaching that part of the subject, he wished to draw a
<col>1276</col>
very material distinction between a trust committed to a man in his public capacity for the exercise of a public duty, and to those private rights of property which might happen to be acquired in the enjoyment of that trust. He conceived it useless indeed, to enter into any extended argument upon the nature of property of that description, because it was plain that the common rights of individual property were very different from those which arose out of the exercise of public trusts. He conceived, indeed, that they were not governed by the same rules, or subject to the same laws, and, therefore, the arguments of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Bankes) must be considered wholly inapplicable. The hon. gentleman seemed to suppose a great impediment must be presented by the evidence not being taken upon oath; but if that argument was good, it ought to have been urged at first, and they might then have been able to save that useless waste of time which this inquiry had already cost them. He, however, saw nothing in that objection to impede their course. They had evidence taken upon oath before a committee of that House; they had also evidence taken at the bar for their own satisfaction; and if the objection was to be fatal to the present case, it followed that it must likewise be fatal to every examination in every case where they might be called upon to take evidence at the bar.&#x2014;He would now speak of his impressions upon the evidence they had heard; and he was compelled to say, taking into consideration the proof of an inveterate habit of bribery pervading the whole corporation, that such a case was made out as justified the interference of the House. He confessed that he had altered his opinion upon the subject, when he heard it stated, that the bribery was confined to the lower class of the people, who, in compliance with a species of established usage, were in the habit of taking money for their votes; he had some doubts of the propriety of depriving the upper classes who remained free from corruption, of the right, which they enjoyed, and rather contemplated the propriety of adopting some measure to alter the nature of the franchise, than the infliction of any punishment which might amount to a total or partial forfeiture of the right of election; but when he found that not only the aldermen of the corporation, but even the returning officer participated in the system
<image src="S2V0018P0I0646"/>
<col>1277</col>
of bribery, he confessed his impression was materially altered; and when he saw that not only the lower classes, but the higher, were engaged in the same practices, he could no longer deny that the interference of the House was necessary, in order to put an end to such practices. An hon. member had stated, that those who voted for sir Henry was on did not vote for the sake of any bribe, but in consequence of a conviction that sir Henry was a supporter of the Protestant Establishment, and disposed to vote against Catholic emancipation. Now he could only say, that if it had been proved to him that a majority of the voters gave their suffrages to sir Henry Wilson upon a principle of that kind, he could not conceive any thing more powerful in favour of their purity of feeling. If they gave their votes from any honest conviction upon a principle of that kind, so far from incurring any blame, they were entitled, in his opinion, to the highest praise for exercising that privilege of English men which he, on all occasions, liked to see displayed in the giving utterance to their free and unbiassed opinions. But when he heard it stated, that the worthy candidate declared, come what, might, he was, without any reference to the Catholic question, determined to do whatever was "just and right," he had no longer any doubt upon the principle which actuated the voters of East Retford. He conceived that the proposition for a continued inquiry ought to have been made at an earlier period; and, upon the whole, he repeated his conviction, that enough had been proved to bear out the disfranchisement of the borough. He was satisfied, that in having recourse to that measure there were some who must be injured by the deprivation of their right of voting, and who were above receiving any money for their suffrage. But, in dealing with rights of a corporate nature, it was impossible to do rigid justice without touching upon the rights of those who were comparatively innocent, and involving them in the punishment; if the deprivation of their franchise could be called a punishment. If the question had involved the deprivation of property, or the destruction of a civil right, he could not have consented to go so far without being overborne by a sense of a great public good; but it was because he drew a distinction between the exercise of the franchise for the public good and a right of
<col>1278</col>
private property, that he admitted the propriety of the interference. At present, he was prepared to declare his intentions only so far on the subject before the House, as that there was that degree of delinquency made out, which warranted the going into the committee.&#x2014;He would next proceed to make some observations on the policy of the course to be pursued, without following the worthy alderman through the various topics of a speech, three-fourths of which were occupied in a discussion of the general question of Parliamentary Reform. Although that question had been discussed in parliament a hundred times, yet the worthy alderman had advanced doctrines upon that question entirely new. The worthy alderman had laid it down that population had increased, and that the debt had increased, and be seemed to sanction the proposition, that the increase of the representation should be proportionate to the increase of the population and of the debt. According to this principle, there should, of course, be proportionate increase in the number of representatives in that House; and he was at a loss to know what limit the worthy alderman would propose to the increase of the representation of the country, if his doctrines were to be acted upon. Then the worthy alderman referred to a quotation, which, if he had given in the <i>ardentia verba</i> in which the doctrine was conveyed, would import that, if the people of Birmingham v/ere taxed without being represented, such treatment was absolute tyranny, and they would be justified in resistance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01074"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman:&#x2014;</member><membercontribution>I said no such thing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01075"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. gentleman had referred to a quotation which, if he had fully brought forward and strictly applied, would establish that doctrine. If taxation without representation was absolute tyranny, and if tyranny justified resistance, would not all those be justified in resistance who were under the age of twenty-one? Again, to cite an illustration adduced on a former occasion by a right hon. Secretary of State, now no more, in reply to this argument, what would become of the whole female sex, or of the large body of freeholders not qualified as 40s. freeholders to vote at elections in this country? In short, if such a doctrine were to be enforced, it would lead to the widest plan of universal
<image src="S2V0018P0I0647"/>
<col>1279</col>
suffrage; although the worthy alderman said, indeed, that he had never been an advocate of such a plan of ultra reform&#x2014;that he, forsooth, had never been a wild speculatist. But, to quote an expression of lord Camden, or of any other person, for the purpose of establishing a comparison between the resistance which a whole country, like America, and that which an individual, or town like Birmingham, might be justified in offering, was absolute nonsense.&#x2014;As little was he disposed to approve of the position which the hon. gentleman would seem disposed to lay down, that members of that House were incapable of forming a decision upon the subject before them, from an apprehension of being liable to charges of having had recourse to influence of an unwarrantable description in procuring their own returns. He would not believe that the members of that House would feel any such incapacity as the hon. member would impute to them. The hon. member had declared, that he himself never had recourse to such sinister influence. He could state the same exemption from having recourse to it for himself; and he was sure that the members of the House would not feel themselves, from any such imputation, incapable of acting as legislators, on an accusation of a breach of the law. That influence was used at elections was admitted; but there was a wide difference between the fair, legitimate influence that was exercised, and that undue and unlawful influence which was carried by the means of the bribery, of which the House lately had evidence. We did not live either in <i>republica Platonis</i>, or in <i>f&#x0153;ce Romuli</i>; we could neither altogether shut out the influence of the feelings of nature, and of those circumstances by which we were surrounded in society. Equally untrue and unjust would it be to suppose that we were actuated by unworthy motives. At county elections in England, the friendly relations and interchange of mutual kindness subsisting between landlord and tenant&#x2014;the affection subsisting between brother and brother, and the other close relations of life&#x2014;unquestionably had, and would continue to have, a material influence. But such influence, however, may not perhaps strictly be sustained by the theory of representation, and was not to be classed in the same scale of offence as a case of absolute bribery and corruption. It might
<col>1280</col>
be very well for a philosopher to lay down plans of theoretic perfection in his closet, but such feelings and motives as he had described, and a thousand other indirect influences, prevailed at elections. He could not prevent their prevalence, and if he could, he did not know that he would. In considering the case of East Retford, and in forming a judgment upon it, he could not exclude from his consideration the case of Penryn. After what had already taken place in the last session as well as in the present, respecting the borough of Penryn, he thought he was entitled to consider the appropriation of its franchise as well as that of East Retford. In forming this assumption, he wished not to be understood as pronouncing finally now upon the case of Penryn, which was not strictly before the House; but, after the decision which had been already come to by the House, the forfeiture of its franchise was an assumption which he was entitled to make. The consideration, therefore, of two places&#x2014;East Retford and Penryn, formed a material element in the view which he at present entertained of dealing with each separately. He was induced to consider the two places conjointly, from the combination of circumstances, the united weight of which made him think that the whole subject might be better disposed of by keeping them both under the view of the House.&#x2014;Now, what had been the practice respecting the transfer of the franchises of boroughs? In all cases of disfranchisement, until that of Gram-pound, the right of election was transferred to the adjoining hundred. In the cases of Shoreham, Cricklade, and Aylesbury, such had been the course that was adopted. In the case of Grampound a new principle was introduced by that House. Vicinage was the invariable rule that had been observed until then. But, on the disfranchisement of the borough of Gram-pound, a bill passed the House to transfer the franchise to Leeds. That bill, however, was not acquiesced in by the Lords; and it was proposed by them, on rejecting the bill sent up by the Commons, to add two members to the representation of Yorkshire. In this way the bill passed; the franchise having been transferred to the agricultural interest, instead of, as was at first proposed, to a large and populous place. Now, he would propose to adopt a middle course in disposing of the transfer of the franchises of these two boroughs,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0648"/>
<col>1281</col>
which, as it was opposed to the partizans of the agricultural and manufacturing interests, might not be likely to conciliate the support of either. He would not vote for the transfer of the franchises of both boroughs to the hundred, or to large manufacturing towns, but he should propose a compromise between the conflicting claims of opposite (using the term in no hostile sense) interests. For this purpose, he should propose, if the forfeiture of the franchises of both were resolved upon, that the transfer of one should be made in favour of a large and populous town, and the other in favour of the hundred. This was the compromise which he proposed to make between what might by some be considered the conflicting claims of the manufacturing and agricultural interests. If the transfer of both franchises was made in favour of large towns, there would be, he anticipated, on future occasions, a very keen look out, a very prying inquiry and searching investigation, into cases of bribery. He anticipated that there would not be wanting parties to get up a case for the purposes of establishing bribery, if they knew that the immediate consequence of making out bribery would be not only a forfeiture of franchise, but a transfer of it to some large and populous town. He would, therefore, disappoint any such eager disposition to get up cases unduly, by not establishing an invariable precedent now in favour of large towns; which, if adopted, would become a standard of reference in all similar cases. In making-this declaration, he wished it to be distinctly understood, that he gave no opinion of marking a preference between Manchester and Birmingham. He was equally attached to the interests of these two important towns; but he had come to no decision in favour of either: he would bestow a fair and impartial consideration on the respective claims of both these large and populous places, and would be guided in his determination, by the result of that consideration. The House would perceive, that throughout these remarks he had proceeded upon the assumption of the forfeiture and transfer of the franchise of Penryn; which was, he trusted, a well-grounded assumption, considering the repeated warnings which that borough had already had, and the disregard it had paid to them. In sanctioning the transfer of the franchise of one of these boroughs to a manufacturing town, and the other to the
<col>1282</col>
hundred, he wished distinctly to be understood, that he would not consent to the transfer of the franchise of East Retford to a remote and populous town. The reasons which induced him to approve of the franchise of Penryn being transferred to such a place, were to be found, in a great degree, in the local circumstances of these two boroughs. Penryn was situated in Cornwall, which returned forty-two members to parliament; and he would not consent to the disfranchisement of one of those boroughs, except on an accusation sustained by competent testimony of that borough having abused its rights of franchise by practices of bribery and corruption. But, in considering the policy of the measure of transferring a franchise to a manufacturing district out of the county in which the borough was situated, it should go for something, that Cornwall, in which Penryn was situated, returned forty-two members to parliament; and that Nottinghamshire, in which East Retford was situated, only returned eight. It should go for something also, that close to Penryn there were other boroughs returning members to parliament. Coupling these considerations with the prospect of extending the elective franchise to two thousand voters by transferring the franchise to the hundred, he thought, there were strong reasons for not removing the franchise from the county of Nottingham, which did not equally apply to the county of Cornwall. There was an objection which was supposed to exist on the part of government, to transfer the franchise of East Retford away from the hundred, arising from the desire they had to invest an individual, the duke of Newcastle, with the power of returning a member, if the franchise was given to the hundred. He declared, upon his honour, that no consideration of that kind influenced him&#x2014;he knew nothing upon the subject, except what he had heard in that House. It might or it might not be, that the duke of Newcastle had such influence; he certainly did not believe it to be so powerful as to sway a body of two thousand voters; but what place could be chosen where some person or persons would not be found to possess considerable influence? It would be mockery to think of selecting any place for the transfer of the franchise which would be perfectly free from influence. All he could say was, that he had no knowledge of the influence alluded to, and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0649"/>
<col>1283</col>
he was actuated by no desire of administering to it. If the contrary course from that which he recommended was pursued, and the East Retford franchise was transferred to a large town not in the county, it would increase the already existing disproportion in the representation of Cornwall and Nottinghamshire. Whilst Cornwall returned forty-two members, Nottinghamshire would be reduced to the representation of six. Now, by a comparison of the representation of the county of Nottinghamshire with the other counties of England, the House would perceive, that that county returned not only far fewer members than Cornwall, but fewer even than the average representation of the other counties. The whole representation of England amounted to 489 members. Now, dropping the nine, and dividing the remaining 480 by forty, the average representation of each county will be twelve members. If, then, the number of the present representatives of Nottinghamshire be four below the average representation of the other counties of England, he thought the House should hesitate before it sanctioned any proposition which would diminish that number by two, and thereby reduce the representation of a large and important county, consisting of one hundred and eighty-six thousand inhabitants, to six members of parliament. These were the considerations which induced him to think that if the House should resolve upon the forfeiture of the franchise of both boroughs, and approve of the transfer of one of them to a populous and manufacturing district, East Retford was not the borough of the two, whose disfranchisement it would be most fitting to fix upon for the transfer of the franchise out of the county in which the borough was situated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01076"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> said, it was, no doubt, desirable that the House should be in possession of the opinions of the right hon. Secretary as to the course which it was his intention to recommend for their adoption; but he thought the better course, and the one most consistent with the usages of parliament, was, to consider each case on its respective merits. With respect to the corruption of the borough of East Retford, and the expediency of disfranchising that borough, those points had been established on evidence so incontrovertible, that it was unnecessary for him to say a single word upon the subject. As to the other point
<col>1284</col>
&#x2014;that of the place to which the franchise should be transferred&#x2014;that was a point on which he differed in opinion from the right hon. Secretary; but he should prefer postponing any statement of the grounds of that difference until the proposition came regularly under the consideration of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01077">The motion was then agreed to. On the motion that the Speaker do now leave chair,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01078"><member>Mr. N. Calvert</member><membercontribution> rose to move the instruction to the committee of which he had given notice; preparatory to which, however, he begged leave to say a few words. It had been admitted by the right hon. Secretary that it was desirable that the elective franchise of one of the boroughs to be disfranchised should be given to the agricultural interest. He should, therefore, propose, that the right of voting in the borough of East Retford should be extended to the hundred of Bassetlaw. In that hundred there was a population of two thousand freeholders, possessing a rental of 191,000<i>l</i>. It was not probable, therefore, that the duke of Newcastle, whose property was said to be contiguous, could have much influence in a district where so large a property belonged to the yeomanry. It was impossible for any parliament to hope that they could, in all cases, prevent the operation of local influence, and deter voters from disposing of their interests to the best advantage. The only thing they could do was, when a strong case of corruption was made out, to apply a remedy. In the amendment he was about to move, his object was, to assimilate the present case to that of Aylesbury, allowing to those who were pure voters of the borough the continuance of the elective franchise. If they went to the extremity of taking it altogether out of the hundred, he doubted very much whether the bill would be successful in another place. He was willing, therefore, to adopt a proposition which might be found practicable; and he would, therefore, move, "That it be an instruction to the committee, that they have power to make provision for the prevention of Bribery and Corruption in the election of members to serve in parliament for the borough of East Retford, by extending the right of voting to all forty-shilling freeholders of the hundred of Bassetlaw."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01079"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> then addressed the House to the following effect;&#x2014;Sir, I
<image src="S2V0018P0I0650"/>
<col>1285</col>
rise to oppose the hon. gentleman's amendment; and in stating the reasons which induce me to do so, I will be as brief as possible, not only for my own convenience, but also that I may not trespass upon the patience of the House. It has been justly said by the right hon. Secretary for the Home Department, that however intricate the subject may be in other respects, and however various the opinions which may be entertained on other points, the decision to which the House has already come, releases any hon. member from the necessity of entering into an examination of the evidence by which the corruption of the borough has been established. That fact is no longer disputed. I am entitled to consider that the House of Commons has determined, I will not say that the borough of East Retford shall be punished, for that would be an incorrect expression, but that it is unfit to discharge the public trust reposed in it by the constitution; and that the corruption practised in it has been so distinctly proved, that it is the duty of the legislature to deprive it of the privilege originally granted it for important public objects, and to bestow that privilege in some other quarter more worthy to enjoy it,&#x2014;Sir, in what I am about to state on this subject, I shall lay out of my argument all considerations grounded on the expediency of parliamentary reform. My opinions on that question remain unaltered; but the introduction of them on the present occasion would be unnecessary and impertinent. In the support of the bill under our consideration, as all the friends of the general question of parliamentary reform will heartily concur; so, on the other hand, it will exhibit no inconsistency in those who are opposed to that question to join with them in support of the present motion. It has been justly observed by the right hon. gentleman, that where evidence has been given of gross, long-continued, and widely-extended corruption, the elective franchise may safely be taken from the place in which that corruption has been practised, even by those who would more than hesitate to adopt any general plan of a reform in the representation. By agreeing to the present bill, the opponents of general parliamentary reform will strengthen their case against any measure which they may deem sweeping, rash, and dangerous. Whether in future any more extensive plan of reform may be adopted, I leave to the wisdom of parliament to deter-
<col>1286</col>
mine. It is sufficient for me, on the present occasion, to say that whatever opinion any hon. member may entertain as to the more general question, he may, with perfect consistency, vote in favour of the present bill. Although the hon. member's motion be in form to preserve the elective franchise to the burgesses of East Retford, though not to the borough, that proposition is not founded on tenderness to those of the burgesses who may be supposed to be pure. His object is, to create another body of constituents; to give to two thousand freeholders the right now possessed by two hundred corporators. Here it is clear that the House is called upon to deliberate on the creation of a new elective body. We have determined to take away the privilege from the borough of East Retford. We are now to look about for the best substitute for that corrupt body. It is as new a question, as if the borough of East Retford had been swallowed up by an earthquake, and as if not a single voter were left alive. The question is divested of all reference to the supposed rights of supposed pure electors in the borough&#x2014;of all the considerations which influenced the House in the early cases of Grampound, Aylesbury and Cricklade. It is a question of establishing a new body of constituents; and it ought to be considered simply as a great question of civil policy, unencumbered by the slightest vestige of any claim on the part of the corporators of East Retford. This being the case, the right hon. gentleman exhibited much adroitness in introducing that as an understood proposition, which there was no pretence for so considering. Even supposing I were to agree to the right hon. gentleman's proposition (on which I will speak presently), that the elective franchise should be given to the agricultural interest, it does not follow that the right hon. gentleman is silently to assume, that that agricultural interest must be in the neighbourhood of East Retford. Where is the link between the right hon. gentleman's premises and his conclusion? Why is the vicinage of that borough, the very atmosphere of which is foul and tainted, to be preferred to the districts likely to return better members to the House of Commons? All the three cases which have been alluded to occurred in the infancy of legislation on those subjects: they were timid in their character; and the motives by which they
<image src="S2V0018P0I0651"/>
<col>1287</col>
were dictated were mingled with a certain degree of tenderness for the individuals who were supposed to be innocent of the corruption proved against the great body of the electors. Those cases must, in fact, be considered as extensions of old rights, not as creations of new. But here, where it has been shown, notwithstanding the artifice which naturally seeks to conceal the fact, that the number of pure electors in the whole borough is not so great as that of the innocent persons whose existence would have obtained mercy for the condemned cities of old, the analogy which it is attempted to establish to the three infant attempts at legislation on these subjects, completely fails. We are now free to choose, from the whole body of the inhabitants of England and Wales, that body likely to send to this House such members as will be best qualified to promote good government and the adoption of wise laws. We are not bound to pay the least regard to the hundred in the neighbourhood of the borough. This is a point over which the right hon. gentleman seemed to think that it was much easier to slide, than to dwell upon.&#x2014;
<quote>"&#x2014;qu&#x00E6;</quote>
<quote>Desperat tractata nitescere posse relinquit."</quote>
The right hon. gentleman talked a great deal of the average of the representatives of the various counties of England. Sir, I well remember having, in former parliaments, heard this doctrine of symmetry, and proportion, and average, assailed by that powerful reasoning and brilliant wit which, alas&#x0021; will never be again heard within these walls. I have heard almost all the opponents of parliamentary reform speak against this doctrine of proportion. I have heard eulogium heaped upon eulogium, and panegyric upon panegyric, with reference to the irregularities of our system of representation. I am, myself, old-fashioned enough, even as a parliamentary reformer, not to wish altogether to depart from those irregularities. I do really wish that the right hon. gentleman would deliver this question from the nonsense of averages; as I do hope that the right hon. gentleman, who is soon to bring forward another great question&#x2014;the question of the Corn-laws&#x2014;will deliver that question from similar nonsense. The view of Cornwall on the one hand, and of Nottinghamshire on the other, must have a tendency
<col>1288</col>
very much to disturb those who are friends to the system of averages. If, however, we must have averages, at least let them not be numerical; let them be founded on a comparison of property and interests. Then, indeed, the difference between forty-two members for Cornwall and four for Rutland would appear extreme. Sir, I repeat, that in arguing this question, the right hon. gentleman seemed to offer no reason whatever for preferring this hundred of Bassetlaw to any other district. He assigned reasons for preferring the transfer of the elective franchise to the agricultural rather than to the manufacturing and commercial interest; but he assigned no reasons whatever for making it to this particular hundred. If any place in Lancashire or Yorkshire had been preferred by the right hon. gentleman, I could have understood the proposition. The right hon. gentleman seemed to think, that his whole argument was complete when he had compared a hundred in Cornwall, with a hundred in Nottinghamshire. Now, really, it by no means follows, that because the one place is unfit to enjoy the elective franchise, the other is fit to enjoy it. I am very ready to allow, that nothing can be more abominable than the first; but does it follow that the last, even if it be expedient to transfer the franchise to an agricultural district, is precisely the district to which it is desirable to transfer it?&#x2014;And now, Sir, for a few words on the preference which the right hon. gentleman shows to the agricultural interest. The right hon. gentleman talks of innovation on the constitution. I contend, that to choose a great manufacturing town, for the purpose of conferring upon it the elective franchise, would be a much less innovation on the constitution, than to vest the right of returning representatives in any county, or part of a county. My reason is this&#x2014;it may indeed be anticipated by everyone who duly considers the history of this country&#x2014;it is perfectly well known that, until the Union with Scotland, it was the practice of the Crown to grant the right of returning representatives to parliament to towns as they gradually rose to consideration and magnitude. I am aware that this practice was not founded on any regular principle, or on any uniform public motive. But, although it is true that many insignificant towns were enfranchised, there was no instance, down
<image src="S2V0018P0I0652"/>
<col>1289</col>
to the reign of Charles the 1st, of any great and important town being left unrepresented in parliament. If we look at the act, giving the right of being represented to the freeholders of the county of Durham, we shall see that it was also given to the freemen of the city of Durham. This ancient practice of the English constitution fell into disuse, in consequence of the Union with Scotland. To give the right of representation to places not adequately represented, would be to act in conformity with the ancient usage; but to give an additional right of representation to places already adequately represented would be an innovation not justified by precedent. It is not on the ground of innovation that I myself object to it; but surely it behoves those who are the opponents of general reform to be watchful, and to give their support to that of the two propostions which is the less innovation. Now, to place burgesses in the room of burgesses&#x2014;to give to towns what other towns have enjoyed, is a much less innovation than to give to freeholders what has been taken from freemen, and to place knights of the shire, or individuals of a similar character, in places which the constitution intended should be filled by manufacturing and commercial members. Not only in the form and the letter, but in the spirit, the one is evidently a much greater innovation than the other. It is much more natural that burgesses should succeed burgesses, than that those who are the guardians of the landed interest should succeed burgesses. The right hon. gentleman has stated, that he entertains some notion that the success of the measure elsewhere will depend upon one of the transfers being made to the agricultural, and the other to the manufacturing interest. What is the present state of the case? Three boroughs have been disfranchised, and their rights have been transferred to the hundreds; that is to say, to the lands around them. A fourth borough has been disfranchised, and its rights have been transferred to the county of York. I am aware it will be said, that although nominally to the county, a portion of that representation may be considered as belonging to the town of Leeds. Even with that allowance, let us see how the matter stands. Six members have been at once transferred to the landed interest; and at least one of the other two added to the representation of Yorkshire.
<col>1290</col>
So, therefore, there is only one, and he not directly but indirectly, who can be justly considered as the representative and guardian of the great commercial interests. Thus, Sir, it appears that under the head of reform there is an immense arrear due to the manufacturing and commercial interests. The proportion between the grants to the agricultural and the grants to the manufacturing and commercial interests is at present as seven to one. Having allowed that preponderance to be established, are we to leave the inequality undisturbed, and to go on increasing the two interests equally? Such, however, is the right hon. gentleman's proposition. But that is not all. The great and ruling class in this country consists of the landed interest. I have no desire that it should be otherwise. I have no wish to disturb the station which that interest holds. But at the same time I am perfectly justified in saying, that if there be any interest in England unprotected, that interest is not the landed interest. If any class of persons in the kingdom is weaker than it ought to be, it cannot be said that it is the class of landed proprietors. I should be very sorry if it were otherwise. But certainly, under such circumstances, it is a very moderate claim on my part, if I confine myself to declaring, that we ought to make a full payment of the arrear due to the commercial and manufacturing interests, before we dream of going on equally in our grants. As to what the right hon. gentleman has said of the probability of insuring success to these measures hi the other House of Parliament if the course recommended by him be adopted, I can only say, that I always feel a very great uncertainty as to the determinations of that noble and august body. It is probably owing to the superiority of their wisdom, and to the humility of my understanding; but I confess that I can never pretend to calculate upon their decisions. I cannot even conjecture them. How, then, can I allow the supposition of the right hon. gentleman to influence my vote on this question? As a burgess, as a "good man burgess" (to use the name. given by our ancestors), sitting in parliament for a borough in Yorkshire, I must proceed on the plain principles of common sense. I must proceed, in every case, on what appears to me to be the wisest choice. Sir, I do not know what the House of Lords may think proper to do: but I
<image src="S2V0018P0I0653"/>
<col>1291</col>
know that the only safe and dignified course for this House to pursue is, to send to that House the result of our own mature and uninfluenced deliberation, seconded&#x2014;as I firmly believe it will be seconded&#x2014;by the almost unanimous voice of the people of England; in the well-founded expectation, that the House of Lords, in a matter affecting the other House of Parliament, connected with the equitable representation of the people, and tending to the return of members of a character to support the good government of the kingdom, the equal administration of justice, and the enactment of wise laws, will at least pay some respect to the opinions of the knights, citizens, and burgesses of the Commons' House, as to what is due to the true representation of the people, and in conformity to the sense of the great body of the people. If I were to depart from this sound principle, I should merely involve myself in a labyrinth, and lose myself in conjectures; and in all probability should, as the reward of my concessions, be induced to cherish hopes which would eventually prove delusive. No, Sir, I will never consent to put the dignity and independence of this House into the hands of persons of whose affections and inclinations I can know nothing.&#x2014;It may be said that we ought not wantonly to incur the risk of a breach between the two Houses of Parliament. Sir, I deprecate as much as any man can deprecate any serious difference between the Houses; but it is impossible for me to suppose, that, in a case like this, the difference could be either very serious, or very durable. If the sense of this House be deliberately and decidedly, and, if need be, repeatedly, pronounced; if, under such circumstances, we should be loudly seconded by the voice of a numerous and powerful people, I cannot pay the House of Lords so bad a compliment as to think, that they would not duly weigh all the circumstances of the case, and consider it only reasonable that the motives which had influenced us, and the people of England, should be allowed to influence them. Let us at least adhere to the ancient maxim, "So to act, that if we fail we shall not be disgraced."&#x2014;I hope, Sir, that in what I have said I may not be supposed to have insinuated any thins: against the other House. Insinuation I would have disdained, had I been disposed to advance any charge; but I felt bound
<col>1292</col>
to declare that which I have declared, in maintenance of the independence and dignity of the assembly to which I have the honour to belong. It has been said by the right hon. gentleman, that if the elective franchise were transferred to Birmingham, my hon. friend would immediately be returned for that place. Unquestionably, if my hon. friend should succeed in this measure, he will have well earned such a distinction. He will have imparted new motives of attachment to the constitution to a numerous and enlightened body of men. But I leave it to my hon. friend to state the reasons which induce him to recommend, that the elective franchise of this borough should be transferred to Birmingham. I have nothing to do with the question as it respects Birmingham, except (comparing it with the section of a county to which the right hon. gentleman proposes to transfer this franchise) to ask, whether the inhabitants of Birmingham, an unrepresented community, a population of 120,000 inhabitants, abounding with men of property, character, and intelligence, or the comparatively small number of 1,500 or 2,000 freeholders of Nottinghamshire, all of whom already possess the right of voting for members of parliament, should be selected as the successors of the delinquent corporators of Retford? Now, Sir, I ask the House whether this is not a question which answers itself? Can any man pretend to say that the claim of Birmingham to this transfer of the elective franchise is not far superior to the claim of a portion only of the county of Nottingham, or that the former is not much more likely to make a sound choice of representatives than the latter? Why, I ask, should we refuse this right to Birmingham, possessing such an extensive population, in order to give it to a number of persons not exceeding one-third of the population of Nottinghamshire? Let the House but consider for a moment the vast importance of the iron trade, of which Birmingham is the chief and centre point&#x2014;a trade spreading itself over a country composed, as I may say, of towns&#x2014;a trade running through Warwickshire and Staffordshire. I am not sure whether iron forms the second or third of the great branches of our trade; I think it is the second; but whether second or third is immaterial to my argument; I say that that trade is the least directly represented of any of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0654"/>
<col>1293</col>
three great branches. But, Sir, we have now presented to us the opportunity of remedying this evil, by giving two members to Birmingham on the disfranchisement of the borough of East Retford. The right hon. gentleman has talked to us of the population of this hundred; I wish he had given us some information as to the population of Staffordshire and Warwickshire. I wish he had told us the proportion of representatives to the population of these counties, as compared with the county of Nottingham, instead of telling us that there existed a small arithmetical disproportion between the places to which he has alluded. The question of disfranchising corrupt boroughs, and transferring the franchise to large towns, was so ably handled by a noble friend of mine, earl Dudley, then Mr. Ward, that I think I cannot do better than quote some of his observations. That noble lord proceeded with such a mixture of wit and argument that every pleasantry contained a reason, and every assertion a proof. It had been said, in the course of the discussion to which I allude, that the corruption which had beeen carried on in the boroughs of Gatton and Old Sarum was enough to make our ancestors rise from their graves. "No," said Mr. Ward, "that is not enough to make our ancestors rise from their graves, for they had their Gattons and their Old Sarums as well as ourselves; but there is a circumstance which is enough to call them from their graves, and that is, to see in the present day towns larger and more populous than their London totally unrepresented." is it possible, I ask, to express the defects of the existing state of the representation better, or in fewer words? I say, Sir, that if the House does not avail itself of this opportunity of giving two representatives to one of the great towns, we shall lose one of the best opportunities that ever presented itself of sinking the constitution more deeply into the hearts of the people, and attaching the whole of the community to our national institutions. We shall also lose the opportunity of giving to one. of our greatest trading interests that protection which it requires, and in the absence of which it is left to depend solely on the justice of parliament. We have been told that, to transfer this franchise in the way recommended by my noble friend, would be to establish a new principle, and that we ought not to fetter
<col>1294</col>
those who may come after us by the adoption of such a course. Sir, I deny that the course recommended by this bill would have either the one or the other of these effects. I maintain that the parliament of future times would be empowered to exercise the same rights and the same discretion, and, no doubt, would adopt the same wariness in acting upon a precedent as we do at present. It is sufficient&#x2014;aye, more than sufficient for us&#x2014;to look at what is passing around us, in order to induce us to sanction changes that have become necessary, without venturing to conjecture either what could be done by those who came after us, or what course the other House of Parliament may think it right to pursue with respect to this measure. We have been told, amongst other things, that this bill will have the effect of creating combinations to detect bribery at elections. But, Sir, I would ask, is that so very great an evil? I say, the disfranchisement of this borough would operate as a warning to all others; and if those others transgressed the law in the face of that warning, let them pay the penalty of their delinquency. An hon. member has talked of this disfranchisement as a punishment to the voters. Sir, I protest against the use or application of the term. I say, we are only taking away the franchise from persons unfit to exercise it. If I looked upon the bill as a punishment, I should object to it; but I view it in a very different light. I look upon it as a measure of great legislative policy, which this House exercises for the general benefit of the community. For my part, though long affected by illness, I came down determined to bear my public testimony to the benefit of this measure, while others of a like beneficial tendency will bear down the name of my noble friend (lord John Russell) to the latest posterity. If I have not been able to enforce my opinions in favour of this most excellent reform, I have at least discharged my conscience from the charge of not having given it my humble support. It is the beauty of our constitution, that while we are enabled to maintain our institution, we are, by its flexibility, also enabled to adapt it to circumstances, without hazarding any of those scenes of tumult and violence, which are so dreadful in their immediate consequences, and so dangerous in their results.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1295</col>
posed to the transfer to the hundred, and thought it would be even better to leave the franchise to East Retford as it was, than to give influence more permanently and decidedly to a particular interest; as would be the case if the amendment was acceded to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01081"><member>Mr. Benett</member><membercontribution> thought that there could be as fair a representation from the hundred, as from any other place.

<p id="S2V0018P0-01082"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, he did not wish to obtrude himself on the House at that late hour, particularly after the very able and eloquent speech of the right hon. and learned member for Knaresborough. The question, however, was of such importance that he could not reconcile it to himself to give a silent vote upon it. In the three former cases in which the House had interfered, the right of election was only extended, and not absolutely transferred; the reason of which was, that in all of them a portion of the voters were found not to be corrupt. Here, however, the right hon. Secretary had admitted, that bribery had been proved to be tolerably general, but he differed upon that point, as it was rather proved to have been intolerably general; for he never had seen a case in which the practice was proved to have been more universal. With respect to what might be done in another place, he thought they had nothing to do. It was for the House of Commons to adopt that course which they deemed proper, and to leave it to the other House to do as they pleased. There were, he perceived, three modes of obtaining freedom in this borough&#x2014;by birth, by service, and by redemption. Now, by this latter means, a person possessing great power and influence might create so many votes as to overwhelm his antagonist. Another reason, too, why he wished to transfer the franchise to large populous towns was this, that in large towns which were represented, there was always an action and re-action of public feeling; while in large unrepresented towns the popular feeling was generally on one side, and opposed to those who, they conceived, deprived them of their privileges. Upon these different grounds he would support the original motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01083"><member>Mr. Secretary Hushisson</member><membercontribution> said, he was perfectly ready to agree with those who
<col>1296</col>
thought that they ought not to anticipate what might be the decision of the other House of Parliament. The House had now passed beyond the stage of judicial inquiry, and had only to consider the course which, under present circumstances, it was expedient to adopt. If the House of Lords, upon inquiry, arrived at the same conclusion with respect to the delinquency of the borough in question, then the only question which would remain for them to decide would be the question of policy. If, on the present occasion they had only to determine the case of one delinquent borough, then he should not be for following the principle which had been adopted in the last case. He certainly should in that case recommend the measure of transferring the franchise to some great commercial town. It was not with one, but with two, that at present they had to deal; and they had to deal with both at the same time. If he rightly understood the principle upon which they should act, it would be this&#x2014;not only to consult the feelings of the other branch of the legislature, but also the feelings of the House of Commons; and, what was of infinitely more importance, the feelings of the various classes into which the nation was divided, and out of which grew the balanced and varied representation that formed the distinguishing characteristic of the constitution of this country. A right hon. and learned gentleman opposite had declared himself favourable to the transfer of the franchise, of which it was proposed to deprive East Retford, to some great commercial community, that never before enjoyed that privilege, rather than to some place that, in previous times, had been partially represented; and had cited instances derived from our history near the commencement of the great civil wars, and during the reigns of the Stuarts. That was a period of our history from which few good precedents could be derived. He would rather refer him to a more recent precedent; that of Grampound, where, on the conviction of a corrupt borough, they I had determined to give the franchise to the county of York; which, considering its great wealth, and the extent of its population, it was thought, and justly, the fittest; body, then without it, to which the right could be transferred. He could not agree that the deprivation contemplated in the &#x0021; present measure was not to be regarded in {the light of a punishment. His right hon.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0656"/>
<col>1297</col>
friend, by whom that had been asserted, opposed himself to no mean authority; namely, that of Mr. Fox. More than once it had been declared by that eminent individual, that to deprive parties so circumstanced, of such a trust, to take away from them so valuable a privilege, would be doing that which, in no point of view, could otherwise be regarded than as a punishment. Now, whether it was considered in the light of a punishment or otherwise, one thing at least was certain&#x2014;that out of the two cases then before parliament, they ought not to neglect the opportunity afforded them&#x2014;they should neglect no means likely to attain an end that might be presumed to be useful and satisfactory to the people. It was his opinion, that before they transferred the privilege, heretofore possessed by a corrupt borough, to a great commercial community, they should consider how far that act was in conformity with the great principle from which they should not depart; namely, that of making the transfers alternate between the trading and the landed interests&#x2014;proceeding always, of course, according to the circumstances of each individual case that came before parliament. He could not agree with his right hon. friend, that all the turbulence and riot which sometimes occurred in this country was confined to places destitute of representation. Nottingham afforded a striking instance to the contrary. It was from that, as a centre, that Luddism spread itself through the country, extended itself to Manchester, and was productive of perhaps more injury than any other similar principle of discord and violence&#x2014;Glasgow again is represented [No, no]&#x2014;hon. gentlemen might say "No, no," but he contended, that Glasgow has a representative in this House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01085"><member>Mr. Huskisson.&#x2014;</member><membercontribution>That might be said of any town or county, that it had but the fraction of a member. Nevertheless, he would repeat his assertion, that Glasgow had a representative in that House. If they departed from the principle to which he had before adverted, they would be establishing a precedent, which might carry them lengths far beyond what they first contemplated, and far beyond what they might, receive external support in carrying into effect; whereas, if they adhered to it, they might improve the
<col>1298</col>
representation of the country, without incurring the hazard of admitting an unwise and dangerous principle of reform. It had sometimes been said, he knew not on what ground, that he was not a friend to the agricultural interest; but he felt the less uneasy under an imputation of that nature, as he was persuaded that an enlarged view of the policy which he always recommended, could not fail to lead to the conclusion, that he had uniformly supported those principles which were best calculated to promote the general interests of each class, and therefore the good of the whole community. His object on the present occasion would certainly be, to confer increased franchises upon the landed interest; but if the two cases were taken into account, as it manifestly was intended they should be, then there would be an equality of advantages&#x2014;a great commercial community receiving benefit in the one case, and a body of the landed proprietors in the other. Upon these grounds, then, he would support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01086"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> contended, that the right hon. Secretary for the Home Department must admit, that, although all the strict rules of evidence observed on a penal proceeding were not applicable to the present proceeding, yet that it was still in some degree a punishment. In the question, whether the elective franchise hitherto enjoyed by East Retford, be or be not transferred to the adjoining hundred, he confessed he had a personal interest; for if the former of these courses were adopted, it would confer upon him a vote. Now he humbly conceived that that would be giving him more than he could justly lay any claim to. What right had he to vote for four members. He certainly had no desire to do so. He would rather see the privilege, in both instances, conferred upon such towns as Birmingham and Manchester. He earnestly called the attention of the House to the importance of the principle which the present discussion involved, and the expediency of guarding chiefly the interest and feelings of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01087"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> said, he thought that some of the reasoning of hon. gentlemen on the other side told quite differently from what they intended it should do. The two right hon. Secretaries opposite, so far from supporting each other, were opposed; the right hon. Secretary for the Colonies having actually given a conclusive reply to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0657"/>
<col>1299</col>
his colleague of the Home Department. The one held, that the question was not one of policy but of justice; the other contended, that it was first a question of justice, and then one of expediency. It was feared that if the elective franchise were transferred to a great town, the other House of Parliament would not agree to the measure. He doubted the probability of this; and he questioned the force of the argument sought to be derived from it. It was proposed that Penryn should be altogether disfranchised, and the right of election carried away to a distant place. All the electors of East Retford were proved to have been corrupt; yet they were to retain a portion of their privileges, holding them in conjunction with the adjoining-hundred. One hundred and fifty of the electors of Penryn, for aught that had been shewn to the contrary, might be honest and innocent men; yet they were to be totally deprived of the elective franchise, and the right was to be transferred to a distant place. He saw nothing like justice or consistency in such a proceeding. He complained of it as being as inconsistent with their dignity, their integrity, and their independence; and as being more calculated to sink and degrade them, than any occurrence which had taken place since he accession of the House of Brunswick.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01088"><member>Mr. V. Fitzgerald</member><membercontribution> agreed that, generally, that House ought in its proceedings to look merely to its own judgment, without being swayed by what might be conjectured to be the views of the other House of Parliament. It was their duty to decide for themselves; and yet, when they considered what had before happened in several cases of this description, they might, even on the principle of being governed only by their own judgment, look to the circumstances which were most likely to promote or retard the effect of their own measures. He regretted that the authority of his right hon. friend opposite should have been applied in a manner so calculated to lead the House to an erroneous decision, and so inconsistent with the sentiments expressed by him on a former occasion. Then he was a decided advocate for conferring the forfeited rights upon the landed interests; now he was the warm supporter of what was called the popular side; then, he thought the manufacturing body sufficiently represented; now he was for giving them additional strength.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1300</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01089"><member>Mr. Wynn,</member><membercontribution> in explanation, said, that in supporting the proposition for conferring rights upon the adjoining hundred, he had never denied that a case might not arise where a different course could advantageously be adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01090"><member>Mr. W. Horton</member><membercontribution> said, that if they had been at present considering the case of Penryn, he believed there would be little difference of opinion. He had no objection to the transference of the elective franchise to large towns; but he did think that it was proper to consider what was likely to be the result of the measure which they had before them. He himself would have had no objection to transfer the franchise to some great town, instead of throwing it open to the hundred; but he must look at the probable effects which their proceedings were likely to produce in another place.</membercontribution></p>

<title>GREECE AND TURKEY.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01092">On the order of the day for going into a committee of Supply.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01093"><member>Sir R. Wilson</member><membercontribution> said, that he rose for the: purpose of obtaining information from the right hon. Secretary opposite, with respect to the Treaty that had been entered into on the 6th of July, and the right, hon. gentleman might be assured, that a satisfactory answer to the questions which he was about to propose, would not only be grateful to that House, but to the country generally. He wished to know whether the Treaty of the 6th of July was to be maintained by his majesty, under all circumstances? He knew that various declarations had been made on this subject by ministers in that, and the other House of parliament, to the same effect as those which had been delivered from the throne; but since those declarations had been made, new events had occurred, which induced many persons to believe that some change was about to take place, and made it desirable that further explanations on the question should be entered into by ministers. The new circumstances that had induced this supposition were notorious. A manifesto, or, at all events, a document which bore an official character, had been promulgated by Russia, and had produced such a line of conduct in the Ottoman Porte, as to induce the Russian
<col>1302</col>
power to declare war, by which that truce had been broken, which it had been hoped would have rendered the Treaty of Akermann more lasting. The consequence of this conduct had been, that Russia, without, as he trusted, any motive of self-aggrandizement, had been obliged to vindicate her own interests and honour, by advancing on those principalities which formed the line of defence of Turkey, and which it was no doubt necessary for her to occupy, because in all former wars they had been desolated by that country. Such a moment as that appeared to him to render it more necessary than ever that the Treaty of the 6th of July should be carried into effect, as it might be the means of preventing Russia from pushing forward, and establishing herself in a position which would prove most inconvenient to the general interests of Europe.&#x2014;But, joined with these rumours, there were I sinister reports&#x2014;reports founded on the jealousy of those who wished to see the honour of England disparaged&#x2014;reports that sprung from another and new class of politicians, who were jealous for the maintenance of their barbarian friends, and who seemed to dread that the Treaty of the 6th of July was only got up for the partition of Turkey; but, on the contrary, He thought that it would only operate as a security for the continuance of the political existence of Greece. These being the circumstances of the case, it was necessary that they should have a decided declaration of the intentions of government on this point; and he therefore hoped that the right hon. gentleman would state whether it was the intention of ministers to support the Treaty of the 6th of July,: and to fulfil its obligations, without allowing any circumstances to occur to induce them to depart from its provisions?&#x2014;With respect to the second question, he had, on a former occasion, asked for some information relative to this topic, but had been informed, that no despatches had been received from the gallant, admiral. What he now wished to ask was, whether any order had been renewed to the commanding officer of our naval force in the Mediterranean, to prevent any supply of provisions from being carried to the Turkish army, and for the purpose of interposing to prevent the removal of non-combatants from the Morea into Egypt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01094"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he hoped the hon. member would excuse him if he
<image src="S2V0018P0I0659"/>
<col>1303</col>
divided the comments that had fallen from him, from the direct questions which he had proposed. The first question that the hon. member had asked was, whether the king was disposed to adhere to the provisions of the Treaty of the 6th of July, without allowing any circumstances to interfere in procuring the pacification of Greece? On that subject, he had to inform the hon. gentleman, that there was no change whatever in the king's determination to do every thing that lay in his power to give effect to that Treaty; but when the hon. gentleman asked whether his majesty would allow any circumstances to interfere with the prosecution of the Treaty, it was evident that he was asking him to give an answer to a future and hypothetical case; and that it was impossible for any minister of the Crown to answer on a contingent proposition, such as the one made by the hon. gentleman: it was as much as he could do to repeat that no change had at present taken place in his majesty's desire and intention of fulfilling the provisions of the Treaty.&#x2014;The hon. gentleman had next referred to certain changes which had taken place in the relations between Turkey and Russia. On this point it was sufficient for him to state, that no official information had reached this country on the subject&#x2014;no declaration of war by Russia against Turkey had been received&#x2014;nothing was known to have occurred to change the situation in which Russia stood at the time when the Treaty of the 6th of July was concluded. Whatever apprehensions the hon. gentleman might entertain on the subject, he felt that he should best perform his duty by not discussing it, until positive information was received by his majesty's government.&#x2014;The second question put by the hon. gentleman was, whether or not orders had been renewed, directing the officer commanding the naval force in the Mediterranean to continue the blockade of those ports of the Morea which were occupied by the Turks? In answer to that he would state, that previous to the battle of Navarino, orders were given to the admiral commanding the combined squadron to institute a blockade of those ports in the Morea that were held by the Turks or Egyptians, and to prevent reinforcements being supplied to them. After the battle of Navarino those instructions were considered as remaining in full force, and they had been acted on by the com-
<col>1304</col>
manders of the allied squadron.&#x2014;With respect to the removal of persons from the Morea, to be employed as slaves, he had no hesitation in saying, that previous to the signature of the Treaty, an intimation was given to his majesty's government that it was the intention of Turkey to remove from the Morea the female part of the population and the children, for the purpose of settling them in Egypt as slaves; and a distinct notification was given to Ibrahim Pacha, that so violent an exercise of rights, if rights they could be called&#x2014;that a feeling so repugnant to the established usage of civilized nations&#x2014; never would be permitted by his majesty, and that this country would certainly resist any attempt to carry such an object into effect.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PUBLIC BUILDINGS&#x2014;OFFICE OF<lb/> WORKS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01095"><member>Sir James Graham</member><membercontribution> said, he rose for the purpose of requiring some information with respect to the object of a motion which was made by the hon. member for Dorsetshire, between twelve and one o'clock on Saturday morning. The hon. member on that occasion moved for a select committee to inquire into the state of the Public Buildings in the Department of the Office of Works, and into the application of part of the land revenue of the Crown, under certain statutes. He certainly expected, that the hon. member would have stated the reason which led him to institute such an inquiry. His surprise was therefore very great, when the hon. member made his motion, without assigning a single reason for it, or pointing out the precise object which he had in view. He hesitated at the moment, as to whether it was his duty to ask for an explanation; but believing that nothing unsatisfactory would result from the committee, he did not deem it necessary to say any thing in opposition to the motion. But a little reflection had convinced him that it was necessary to come to a right understanding of the motives which had induced the hon. member to move for a committee. He certainly was of opinion, that this subject would naturally come under the inquiry of the Finance Committee, Promises had been made of a reduction of expense in this department; but although those promises had not been kept, yet he believed the public were content to wait for the result of an inquiry, to be instituted by the Finance Committee, with reference to this subject. In those hands he
<image src="S2V0018P0I0660"/>
<col>1305</col>
thought the inquiry to which he alluded should have been placed, and he was prepared to contend against any change in the tribunal before which the investigation ought to take place. It would be invidious to anatomize the materials of which the hon. member's select committee was constituted. But he would say, that four of its members, either by the offices they held at present, or by their recent connexion with office, were open to a peremptory challenge, and two of them would stand in a peculiarly strange situation&#x2014;that of sitting in judgment on their own conduct. The hon. member for Dorsetshire had said, that the committee was not constituted for the purpose of inquiring into the money expenditure, but only into the style of architecture adopted in the repair and erection of palaces, and to consider whether any trees had been improperly cut down by Mr. Nash. He certainly congratulated the hon. member, and the Master of the Mint, on the escape which they had made from the erroneous labours of the Finance Committee, by undertaking what he might call the trifling labours of the Select Committee, for which the hon. member had moved. He, however, feared that the Master of the Mint and the chief commissioner of Woods and Forests, backed by the majority of this committee, would extend the inquiry, and force the committee, against the better judgment of the hon. member and of other gentlemen who were placed on it, to go into the question of expenditure. They might take a glance at that subject, to stifle a more rigorous inquiry before the Finance Committee itself. A favourable report might be given as to the expenditure; and, in consequence of that slight inquiry, the subject might be overlooked by the Finance Committee. Now, he wished to guard against this. He was desirous that the subject should be left in the hands of the Finance Committee, and that it should not hereafter be urged, as a reason for not submitting it to the investigation of the Finance Committee, that an imperfect inquiry had already taken place before an unfit committee. Such a proceeding should not be an obstacle to a fair and full investigation of the expenditure. He stated this fairly, openly, and honestly, because he was anxious to guard himself against that which was not unlikely to occur. Perhaps the hon. member would have the kindness to state what limits were to be laid down for the labours of
<col>1306</col>
this Select Committee; and it would be satisfactory also, if ministers would declare what their views of this case were.&#x2014;Hereafter, he hoped, notwithstanding what might be done by the Select Committee, that the Finance Committee would inquire into the whole question of the Woods and Forests Department, and also into the expenditure of the Crown for the building of palaces.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01096"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, that his reason for not entering into an explanation on the former occasion was, because he was not aware that any was required. As to his having made his motion at so late an hour he could not avoid it: if he had postponed his motion to Monday, it was very doubtful whether he could have brought it forward. After listening with great attention to what had fallen from the hon. baronet, he could not see what the object was for which the hon. baronet wished him to give an answer. The hon. baronet seemed to complain of his having taken a particular subject out of the hands of the Finance Committee. Was the Finance Committee to embrace every subject of inquiry before the House? Was it not competent to every member to take up any particular subject, if he thought it could in any other way be more fairly considered, than it could be before the Finance Committee? Did the hon. baronet know what a mass of business was at present before the Finance Committee. He was not aware that the subject to which his motion referred would come before that committee. He did not think that they would have time to entertain it before the next session. The hon. baronet had objected to the manner in which the committee was constituted, and there seemed to be a sort of oblique insinuation, as if he had moved for the committee, for the purpose of screening some individuals whose conduct was likely to be overhauled in the Finance Committee. Now, what purpose had he to answer&#x2014;what advantage was he likely to receive in moving for this committee? What benefit would it be to him to screen persons who were guilty? The hon. baronet asked what was the object of the committee? There were two principal views connected with the formation of the committee&#x2014;one related to the public expenditure, and the other to national taste. Both were fit objects for the consideration of parliament. If they saw a large ex-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0661"/>
<col>1307</col>
penditure going on for the purpose of ornamenting the country, surely it was worthy of the House to see that it was applied to proper purposes. It was not, he contended, a trifling or a useless labour, to preserve the character of the country for taste, by bringing those subjects under the consideration of the House. Surely, the subject of their public buildings ought to be brought under the attention of parliament. Before now, buildings demanding a large expenditure had been undertaken wholly unknown to that House, and had never been brought under its notice until a large expense had been incurred. They had known 30,000<i>l</i>. or 40,000<i>l</i>. to be spent, in the first instance, without the cognizance of the House; and then they were obliged to go on and accomplish the work. The House had been kept too much in the dark on this point. Let them look to the Custom-house. No less a work than that had gone on, and the House was not informed of it until the foundations were laid; and they all knew how they were laid. If the Select Committee entertained the question, there was nothing to prevent the Finance Committee from applying themselves to it, as part of the national income. It would be for the Select Committee to consider how far certain works had been proper and necessary, and how far it would be right to put a stop to any of the plans now in progress.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01097"><member>Mr. Arbuthnot</member><membercontribution> said, that as allusion had been made to him, it became necessary for him to state that he had nothing to do with the formation of this committee; but he would, as head of the Woods and Forests Department, do every thing in his power to give effect to the inquiry. He had no desire to screen himself from any investigation. He had only to ask the committee fairly to do its duty. He should not have been placed in his present office if there had been any thing in his conduct that would not bear the strictest scrutiny. If it were allowable for a man to speak of himself, he would say that twenty-one years ago, he had obtained, not through great connexions, nor by ministerial influence, an income under an act of parliament, fully equal to that which he now possessed. He might also be permitted to observe, that on the present occasion he had not sought for office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01098"><member>Sir J. Yorke</member><membercontribution> said, it appeared to him very extraordinary, that, after they had been told that the Finance Committee could
<col>1308</col>
not terminate their labours this session, his hon. friend should have subtracted six members from that committee. As to the public buildings, they were certainly a sort of hobby of his hon. friend, and no doubt he presided over the public taste very judiciously, but then his hon. friend had a manner which was directly against economy; for he was in the habit of saying, "I don't like the building you have erected here; take it down, and put up another." He was therefore sorry that there had been no explanation of the reasons for abducting six members from the Finance Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01099"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> said, that the committee for which he had moved would only sit on two or three days in the week, when the Finance Committee were not sitting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01100"><member>Mr. R. Colborne</member><membercontribution> said, that when they saw the encroachments which were daily making upon the park, it was high time that there should be no doubt as to the intention of government. He had seen numbers of trees railed round, and it appeared to him to be intended to cut them down. He thought these were fair objects for the investigation of a committee. The Treasury board had very little leisure to bestow upon such subjects, and he had never known a chancellor of the Exchequer who did not pray to be released from such an addition to his labours. It was, therefore, become absolutely necessary to have a committee of some kind, under whose authority the matter might be fairly investigated, and who might be able to apply some timely check to the present extravagant proceedings. They saw every where extensive and costly buildings erected, as it was supposed, upon regular estimates, but when they were completed it frequently turned out that there had been no estimate at all. Much good might arise from an inquiry. At all events, he deprecated any attempt to take these things out of the hands of a committee, in order to place them under the control of the office of Woods and Forests.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01101"><member>The Hon. G. A. Ellis</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to take that opportunity of putting a question or two to the first commissioner of Woods and Forests. First, he wished to know whether it was intended to cut down the north row of trees in the Mall in St. James's park? It would be in the recollection of the House, that in answer to a question put last session, it was affirmed, that government would keep to the inten-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0662"/>
<col>1309</col>
tion it originally held of not removing those trees. He owned he entertained great doubts upon this subject, from perceiving the railing which had been placed round the trees, and which was a most extensive encroachment. He had, indeed, understood that Mr. Nash, the architect, intended to raise a bank, covered with shrubs, in order to hide the dead wall which was an unseemly object. But, if that were all that was in view, the railing ought to have been on the north side, and the benefit of the shade of the trees given to the public. It was rumoured, too, that Mr. Nash had said that parliament did not sit all the year round, and it would be seen what would be done when parliament was not sitting. The other question he had to ask was, whether there was to be an opening into St. James's park, opposite Waterloo-place? A foot-way entrance here was so evident an improvement, that he should not have put the question if it had not been rumoured that Mr. Nash did not wish there to be any such opening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01102"><member>Mr. Arbuthnot</member><membercontribution> denied any responsibility on the score of the execution of the plans for the improvements in the park; for though they were sent to his office, they were proceeded on after he left it. Both from the government and Mr. Nash he had received the most positive assurances, that it was not intended to cut down the trees in the Mall. He did not think it quite fair to talk of encroachments upon the parks. When he had waited upon the king to take his commands upon the plan of improvements, his majesty expressly desired that a carriage road should be opened from Pimlico to Storey's Gate, that the whole of that part of the park where the cattle grazed should be opened to the public. Upon the subject of the foot-way through the buildings at Waterloo-place, it was not in his power to give any answer. He believed there was no such path in the original plans.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01103"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that when a question was put to him last year, he had stated distinctly that it was not the intention to cut down any of the trees, except one which projected so as to interfere with the wall. At that time, the plan shewing the new alterations was before the House; and there was no intention on the part of the Treasury to make any alteration in it. He had even taken the trouble to see the architect; for the purpose of
<col>1310</col>
ascertaining if he understood there was any latitude allowed him in carrying the designs into execution, and he had been distinctly informed, that there was no such latitude, nor no intention to alter what was originally proposed. While on his legs, he would allude to the abduction, as it had been called, of some members from the Finance Committee. But he did not think that abduction at all inconsistent or absurd. For, as this part of the public expenditure was to be brought under the consideration of the Finance Committee, that committee would be the better prepared to deal properly with it, if a few of their members were employed in arranging the subject for the consideration of all of them. He did not think any detriment could ensue from the committee being preceded in their labours by the labours of a few gentlemen selected from among themselves. With respect to the word "suspicious," he did not know in what sense the hon. baronet meant to apply it. If the hon. baronet meant to say that because he was connected with government he would take steps to cloak or conceal any part of the system&#x2014;if the hon. baronet supposed him capable of going into any committee to which he should be appointed by that House, to be instrumental in crushing or misleading the inquiries of such committee, the hon. baronet imputed to him conduct of which he was totally incapable. He would report, as freely as any hon. gentleman not connected with government, and as honestly as the hon. baronet himself would, if he were a member of the commission.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01105">The House having resolved itself into a committee,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01106"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that in agreeing to the vote which he was about to propose, the committee would not pledge itself to any opinion whatsoever. The House was only called upon to vote the appropriation of money which would be paid on the 5th of April and the 6th of July next. What was to be done with the money would be matter of after-consideration, but this preliminary step was necessary. With this observation he merely proposed calling on the House to vote for the appropriation of the sum of 2,164,000<i>l</i>., which would be paid by the

trustees of naval and military pensions on the 5th of April and the 5th of July.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01107"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> took occasion to allude again to the slow proceedings of the Finance Committee, and expressed a wish that there was some statement laid before the House of the actual income and expenditure of the country. An hon. baronet the other evening had stated, that he did not expect much from the Finance Committee, because, although our income was above fifty millions, more than thirty millions were absorbed by the debt, so that they had not more than nineteen or twenty millions to deal with. Now, he confessed this alarmed him very much as to the results to be expected from the examination. He looked, not to the nominal amount paid into the Treasury, but at the sum drawn from the pockets of the people. That sum was nearly fifty-eight millions, but more than eight millions were spent in the collection; so that the nett amount to be applied to the public expenditure was only fifty millions. If, therefore, the difference between the nett income and the gross income was added to the sum the committee had to work upon, there would be, instead of nineteen or twenty millions, a sum of twenty-seven millions, out of which the Finance Committee was to labour in the work of reduction. He recollected hearing, some years ago, that a proposition was made to lord Liverpool, of uniting the Boards of Customs and Excise, and it was said that by this union 1,500,000<i>l</i>. a year would be saved. Lord Liverpool was inclined to attend to it, but lord Castlereagh put it aside, for a reason which he did not think it proper to mention then. At those two boards there were thirty-four commissioners and assistant commissioners, and he did think this an immense body of persons to transact the business of the boards, and that a very great reduction might be made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01108"><member>Sir J. Yorke</member><membercontribution> wished to ask the chancellor of the Exchequer, who he knew was not like Mr. Pitt, an heaven-born minister&#x2014;indeed, his right hon. friend had come into office without knowing much more than that two and two made four, or at all events knowing very little about Treasury affairs&#x2014;he wished to ask his right hon. friend, whether in his opinion Mr. Finlayson, that modern Cocker, had not taken very exaggerated views on the subject of these life annuities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01109"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said,
<col>1312</col>
that really after the compliment his gallant friend had paid him, he did not see how his gallant friend could expect him to give any opinion on the mass of figures which Mr. Finlayson had laid before the Finance Committee. To the best of his judgment, however, the system had produced a loss to the country; that was the opinion also of the Finance Committee. With respect to what had fallen from an hon. gentleman, he could assure him, that the Finance Committee had never, in the reductions they contemplated, lost sight of the charges of collecting the revenue; and that the most effectual means would be taken to lay before the public a clear and plain statement of the national accounts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01110"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> did not know how it was possible for the Finance Committee to do more than they were doing. They sat three times a week, from twelve to four, and the sub-committee sat on the alternate days. He hoped the committee would not suffer itself to be hurried forward by the anxiety, however commendable, of individuals; and that it would abstain from making any report, until it could make one which would be satisfactory to the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01111"><member>Sir M. W. Ridley</member><membercontribution> said, that too sanguine expectations of reduction should not be held out, when it was considered that 30,000,000<i>l</i>. were to be paid as interest of the debt, and the charge for the army, navy, &amp;c. amounted to 19 or 20,000,000<i>l</i>. He admitted that the charge of 8,000,000<i>l</i>. for the collection of the Revenue was one that merited the strict attention of the committee. The committee, he was sure, would gladly receive any suggestion from his hon. friend; and he should be glad if they had the benefit of his assistance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01112"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> observed, that the Finance Committee, would not be the worse for being reminded of particular duties as it proceeded. With reference to the measure, however, which had already emanated from it&#x2014;the bill for repealing the power of granting life annuities&#x2014;he did not quite agree in the course which had been pursued, and wished that Mr. Finlayson's letter should be laid before the House. As it seemed to him, the table of rates, subject to which these annuities had been granted, ought to be changed, rather than the practice of granting them discontinued.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01113"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> bore testimony to the constant exertions of the Finance Committee, and particularly to those of the hon.

chairman whose attention to its business was unremitting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01114"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that the money named in the vote was money to be received from the Bank in the way of loan; and he entirely objected to applying borrowed money to the support of the Sinking-fund. The statement of the right hon. Home Secretary a few nights ago had shown that at most there was only a surplus of 50,000<i>l</i>. applicable to the redemption of the debt. He believed that there was no surplus at all, but a deficiency rather, to three times that amount; but at all events that sum was the most which could be available. He thought, therefore, that instead of applying borrowed money to sustain this Sinking-fund, it would be better to wait and see whether the Finance Committee did not pronounce the whole Sinking-fund a delusion. He was disposed to move, as an amendment, that the money in question should not be carried to the account of the consolidated fund, but used to take up part of our unfunded debt; which perhaps we might not always be able to take up upon such favourable terms as we could at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01115"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that the suspension of the appropriation of this money would not alter the arrangement relative to the Sinking-fund; but it would deprive the government of supplies which were wanted for the purposes of immediate necessity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01116"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. member had greatly under-stated the amount of surplus over expenditure, when he stated it to be only 50,000<i>l</i>. The amount of surplus was to be estimated not only by the amount of income, but also by that of our expenditure. Now, admitting that there was to be no increase in our income, from the estimates it would appear that there was a reduction of 1,200,000<i>l</i>. in our expenditure. This, therefore, gave us together with the 2,000,000<i>l</i>. from the Bank, if it should be appropriated to the Sinking-fund, 3,000,000<i>l</i>. more than the 50,000<i>l</i>. which the hon. member had stated to be the only sum which we could appropriate to the Sinking-fund. The committee must clearly perceive that this 2,000,000<i>l</i>. should go to the credit of the income of the country, however it might be appropriated. The prospect of a probable increase in the revenue would augment still further the available resources of the country,</membercontribution></p>
<col>1314</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01117"><member>Sir J. Wrottesley</member><membercontribution> protested against the continuance of a Sinking-fund on the principle of that now sanctioned by parliament. What could be more absurd in private life, than for a gentleman to spend the whole of his income, go into debt, borrow a sum of money to pay it, and then exclaim, "See what a job I have made of it, I have paid off a couple of thousand pounds with one hand, which I have borrowed with the other&#x0021;" The question for the House to consider was, whether they would continue the absurd act which obliged them to maintain a fund for the redemption of their debt, when all their income was absorbed by their expenditure.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LIFE ANNUITIES REPEAL BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01119">On the motion for the further consideration of the report of this bill,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01120"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> suggested, that it would be more expedient to suspend this bill, than to repeal it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01121"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that the objection was to the tables and not to the principle of the bill itself. Any loss which might have, been sustained would not be remedied by the repeal of the act now. The only thing that could be done would be to prevent the granting of other annuities until new tables were prepared. In this view of it he concurred in the suggestion of the hon. member, that they should not at once repeal the act, but rather suspend it, in order to afford time for considering what; other tables could be got ready, which might put an end to the apparent loss; for he was not convinced that the loss was a real one. He admitted that they had good authority for saying that there was a loss; and on that ground the committee had recommended an immediate; consideration of the subject, and that other tables should be adopted. He concurred in the suggestion for suspending the act, but whether it were suspended or repealed, it would amount to the same thing; for the repeal would be on the understanding that it was to continue only till new tables could be prepared. It appeared: from Mr. Finlayson's letter that a loss had been sustained by the public, amounting to about 8,000<i>l</i>. a-week on the annuities sold under this act; and that loss had been attributed to want of due attention to the interests of the public, in not having some such measure as the present
<image src="S2V0018P0I0665"/>
<col>1315</col>
proposed some years ago, when the matter was brought under the consideration of the Treasury. A noble lord (Bexley) had been the first person blamed for this omission. Now, he would acquit that noble lord from blame altogether. The letter was received by him (Mr. Herries) on the 30th of April, 1827, five years after that noble lord had quitted the Treasury. As to lord Goderich, he was equally free from blame. He was glad the production of the Letter had been moved for, as it would be seen by it that the respectable individual by whom it was written had announced, that he would prove his statement by tables which he was preparing, but which were not ready. So that the proof was, in fact, not yet before the Treasury. But those to whom the letter was addressed were aware of the nature of the loss, and that it did not depend on the continuance of the act, but arose from annuities already granted, and which could not be taken away, being on lives which turned out to be longer than the usual average. Any alteration in, or even the repeal of, the act, could make no difference to the public with respect to those annuities, and for this reason&#x2014;that when the funds rose above 80, the purchaser of the annuity could not get any advantage from the difference above that price. The price was above 80 at the time the letter was written, so that the Treasury could wait, without any loss to the public, until the tables were ready; and there was even a compensating power in the high price against any loss that might have been sustained before. He hoped the House would adopt the suggestion of the hon. member, and allow the act to be suspended, and not repealed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01122"><member>Lord Althorpe</member><membercontribution> said, it was clear that a considerable loss had been sustained by the public from the annuities granted under the act. Blame might not be attributable to government for what took place before they received the communication alluded to, but he understood that annuities had since then been granted on the same disadvantageous terms to the public. If that were so, blame must rest somewhere. The communication of Mr. Finlayson was a sort of debtor and creditor account. He showed the amount paid by the purchaser, the amount of stock cancelled, and the amount which
<col>1316</col>
that stock would have produced from that time; and, comparing it with the value received by the purchaser in his annuity, he showed that, in one year, there had been a loss of 10,700<i>l</i>.; and, as a great proportion of the annuitants were living the loss still continued. The right hon. gentleman had said, that nothing could be done by government, in consequence of the communication made to them; but it should be recollected, that all the insurance offices had altered their calculations of insurance about that time; but it was singular that government should not have made a similar alteration, having the information before them as to the loss which the country was sustaining, by the rate at which the annuities were granted. Surely, they might have ceased to grant any fresh annuities, until the promised tables were ready. He agreed in what had been said about suspending the act for the present; for no man could doubt that the transfer was a loss to the public; but his great surprise was, that this step had not been taken before. The right hon. gentleman had said, that the letter of Mr. Finlayson was received only on the 30th of April, 1827, but that letter alluded to a former letter, written in 1819, of which nothing was said, and which was not before the House. It was said, that lord Bexley had told the writer to make his calculations and tables; but if a loss was then pointed out, why had not some steps been taken with a view to amend the act?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01123"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution>, in explanation, observed, that the letter of 1819 did not speak of the great loss to which the last letter adverted, but merely announced that the tables were unfavourable to the public. The subject was one of such extreme difficulty, that it ought not to excite surprise that no step was taken on it immediately.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01124"><member>Lord Howick</member><membercontribution> said, that when the letter should be before the House, it would, he had no doubt, be seen, that blame attached in some quarter for not having acted upon it earlier, as great loss had accrued to the public from the mistaken calculations on which the annuities had been granted. He agreed that it would be proper to suspend the act for the present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01125"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, the noble lord seemed to think that the public would gain on the contracts already made by the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0666"/>
<col>1317</col>
suspension of the act. The only beneficial effect from the suspension of the act would be, that no additional annuities could be granted, until new tables were made, but all the contracts already made must be continued. He was Secretary to the Treasury in 1809, when this measure was introduced. At that time, complaints were made, that individuals wishing to make a provision for themselves or families had no certain fund on which such annuities could be secured, without those many risks to which they would be exposed by purchasing from private individuals. It was unnecessary for him to point out the description of persons to whom such annuities were extremely desirable, or to describe the many practices, with respect to grants of annuities, by which property, the saving of a long life of industry, was sacrificed, and families brought to ruin. Considerations, founded on a knowledge of the existence of such practices, induced the government of that; day to adopt the plan of granting annuities for life, or for a terra of years. Mr. Perceval, then chancellor of the Exchequer, thought the plan extremely desirable; and some of the most intelligent men of that day were directed to make out tables, on which the value of the annuities was to be calculated. It was considered, that, in a country where the public stock or debt might be considered as a sort of interminable annuity, it would be extremely, useful, under the circumstances he had mentioned, that a part of it should be appropriated as annuities, terminable with lives, or at a given number of years. There was this difference between annuities so granted, and those purchased from annuity offices&#x2014;that while in the latter a profit was expected to be derived by those who granted the annuity, the government sought no profit from the grant, and made it solely from the consideration of its advantages to that class of the community to which he had alluded. The calculations were made from the best data that could be then furnished; but it was found that the majority of the lives on which the annuities had been so granted, were longer than the ordinary average of life, and some loss was derived to the public in consequence; but he was astonished that it should be gravely stated, that the public had sustained a loss of 400,000<i>l</i>. on annuities, the whole amount of which did not ex-
<col>1318</col>
ceed 640,000<i>l</i>.; thus making the loss amount to two thirds of the whole. Some extraordinary delusion must have existed on this subject, to give rise to such statements. He admitted that the lives on which the annuities had been granted, were found to be rather longer than the ordinary average of human life, and that some loss had been thus sustained. The means by which such loss might be prevented in future, would be to have better tables; but he trusted that the House would not consent to the abolition of all annuities in future. That course would have a most injurious effect, by closing the door on the means thus afforded of securing to the class of persons to which he alluded the means of making that, provision for themselves on which they could calculate with certainty. He agreed that it would be better to suspend the operation of the act for a time; but he thought it would be highly prejudicial to a large class of the community if the plan was given up altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01126"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> admitted the great benefit which the public had derived from the system of granting government annuities; but expressed his surprise, that, after the communication which had been made to government on the subject of their disadvantageous bargain, no steps had been taken to correct the error. The public seemed to have been well informed of the advantage which the government terms gave them; for on looking at the list of annuities, it would appear, that two thirds of them were on women's lives. Now it appeared by the report of one of their committees last year, that the lives of women were, on the average, longer than those of men. It appeared to him, however, that Mr. Finlayson, in his estimate, had not taken into his calculation the interest of the money paid by the purchasers of the annuities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01127"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that Mr. Finlayson had been directed to make a calculation on fifteen thousand lives. His work was a work of figures, and he did not deserve blame for exaggeration, for he expressed no opinion one way or the other. As to the letter sent to the Treasury, he could state that great remissness must have existed somewhere on this subject; for in the same year in which Mr. Finlayson's first letter was written, a similar representation had been transmitted to government. He had no doubt that on inquiry
<image src="S2V0018P0I0667"/>
<col>1319</col>
great blame would be to be attached in some quarter for negligence on this point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01128"><member>Mr. P. Thompson</member><membercontribution> rose only to correct an error into which the Secretary for the Colonies had fallen. The right hon. gentleman had said, that it was impossible that the calculation could be correct, because a loss of 8,000<i>l</i>. per week was declared to have taken place, or upwards of 400,000<i>l</i>. per annum; being two-thirds of the whole annuities. Now, the right hon. gentleman had made a mistake between capital and interest; for Mr. Finlayson stated the loss to the public to be 8,000<i>l</i>. per week, or 400,000<i>l</i>. per annum, capital, not interest.</membercontribution></p>

As, however, the Penryn Disfranchisement bill was to come under discussion that evening, and as any ulterior proposition which he might have in view with reference to East Retford would, in a great measure, depend upon the fate of that bill, he would move, "that the Order of the Day for going into a Committee on the East Retford Disfranchisement Bill be read, for the purpose of postponing it to Monday" [cries of no, no &#x0021;].</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01137"><member>Mr. Manning</member><membercontribution> hoped that, after the House had determined to extend the privilege of East Retford to the adjoining hundred, at least the same course would be followed in the case of Penryn.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01138"><member>Mr. D. Gilbert</member><membercontribution> said, he had abstained from taking any part in the debates which had passed upon the subject, as he was connected with most of the gentlemen and with the interests of the district concerned. At present, however, he was desirous of doing away with a <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> feeling which prevailed in the House, with respect to the representation of the county of Cornwall. He knew that large assemblies acted upon first impressions, and that it was extremely difficult to remove them. He should, however, attempt the task, convinced that, were the House not undeceived in this respect, it would be impossible for it to come to a right decision. He would deny that the interests of Cornwall were better represented, in consequence of its numerous boroughs, than any other county. He was not inclined, if a borough were disfranchised, to give the representation to such a county as York; for the representation of four members for the same district was extremely inconvenient. He disapproved of the proposed plan with respect to the two boroughs; but if it was to be pursued, he was convinced, that in strict justice and consistency, its application ought to be inverted; that the measure intended for the one ought to be applied to the other, and <i>vice versa</i>. He would ask what was the representation of Cornwall? Why was its extent so much complained of, and why should the House wish to diminish it? It had been said the other night, that the borough of East Retford ought not to be disfranchised, because.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0668"/>
<col>1321</col>
the county of Nottingham was unequally represented in that House, and that, consequently, the number of members returned for places in the county ought not to be diminished. Now, he would claim the same consideration for the county of Cornwall. Although this latter county might abound in representative towns, few of the members returned were Cornish men, or connected with Cornish interests. The boroughs of Cornwall conceived that they could get better representatives from Scotland, Ireland, and other distant parts, than they could find among the natives. He would read over a list, by which it appeared that out of the forty members sent into that House by Cornwall, only six were Cornish gentlemen. He must, indeed, confess, that the county, and those in it, were immensely benefitted by the power of imparting to Scotch, Irish, and other gentlemen, the privilege of sitting in that House as the representatives of boroughs with which they had no connection, tie, or interest. It had been said, that this brought a great influx of wealth into the county, and poured an unreasonable number of Cornishmen into all government offices and employments; but these were considerations foreign to the immediate question relating to Penryn. The advantages of throwing the representation of this borough into the neighbouring hundreds were great; and they were irresistible, if the principle of the motion before the House were to be pursued. The hundreds in the neighbourhood of Penryn comprised a hundred thousand acres, and from fifteen hundred to two thousand freeholders; with three large towns, of which one alone, Penzance, contained twenty thousand inhabitants. If it were thought best that the franchise either of Penryn or East Retford were to be given to the hundred, there was nothing in the local circumstances of the former to render such a measure inexpedient; whilst, in the case of East Retford, not only was the adjacent district less populous; not only were there no large towns in the neighbourhood; but, if he was rightly informed, there was a predominant interest in the adjoining district, which rendered an extension of the franchise to the hundred not a reform or an improvement in the representation, but a mere transfer of the borough into the hands of an individual. He should certainly give his vote against carrying the
<col>1322</col>
franchise of East Retford to the neighbouring hundred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01139"><member>Sir Joseph Yorke</member><membercontribution> said, that when he saw a president of the Royal Society rise to read them a memoir or paper, for the purpose of showing that Cornwall was not over-represented, and that Nottingham was, he thought it would puzzle that learned person not a little to accomplish such an object, and the result had justified his anticipation. He thought the measure supported by the right hon. Secretary, of transferring the franchise to a great commercial community, was called for by the: increase of wealth, the progress of civilization, and the march of intellect. When such a number of these great towns had grown up to be so many Londons, it was time they should be represented. Manchester should not be allowed to remain longer without a member in that House. He hoped the right hon. Secretary would persevere in the course which he had indicated it to be his intention to pursue. He rejoiced to see a minister of the Crown not afraid to look a moderate reform in the face.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01140"><member>Mr. C. Pallmer</member><membercontribution> said, that, having been one of those who last year voted with a right hon. gentleman whose voice, unhappily, the House would never hear again, that the elective franchise of this borough should be thrown into the adjoining hundreds, he could not with any consistency now give a contrary vote. Instead of seeing any thing to induce him to alter, he had had his opinion confirmed by the remarkable fact, that, with respect to East Retford, where the guilt had been more universal, and the population of the adjoining hundreds less numerous, the House; had, but a few evenings ago, resolved upon the same measure of justice. Surely it was not fair to visit the smaller degree of guilt with the greater degree of severity &#x0021; With respect to the argument of the different counties in which the places were situated, he never could admit that guilt was more punishable because it was in one county than it should be in another. He professed himself as anxious as the noble lord could be to punish corruption; but he would never agree to reach it through injustice. The corruptors were worse than the corrupted; and though he refused to go with the noble lord, in punishing the many for the guilt of the few, in: the present instance, he assured him, that if he would make his attack upon the cor-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0669"/>
<col>1323</col>
ruptors, and introduce a measure to require that every member should solemnly declare that he had in no degree exercised corruption, the noble lord should have his humble but zealous support. The hon. gentleman concluded with moving, as an amendment, "that it be an instruction to the Committee on the said bill, that they have power to make provision for preventing Bribery and Corruption in the Election of Members to serve in Parliament for the Borough of Penryn, by extending the right of voting to all forty-shillings Freeholders in the Hundreds of Penwith and Kerrier."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01141"><member>Sir C. Burrell</member><membercontribution> seconded the amendment, because he was of opinion that the corruption had not been so general as to justify a transfer of the franchise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01142"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> concurred with the hon. member for Surrey, that it did seem a little hard that Penryn should suffer for the delinquency of another borough; and it further appeared hard, that, according to the proposition which had come from the other side of the House, both boroughs were to be punished more severely than they would otherwise have been, owing to the delinquency of each. With respect to Penryn, he understood the Secretary of State for the Home Department to say, that he declined adopting a different measure of punishment, entirely in consequence of the corruption of another borough, and yet he could not reconcile it with this declaration, nor with his own notions of any principle of justice, that a change should have taken place in the determination avowed by gentleman of that House. With regard to the delinquency of Penryn, the present was not a time to speak of it, but it was a proper opportunity to consider of the measure of punishment; and he was sorry that this measure of punishment should be altered, in consequence of circumstances wholly foreign to the borough and its offence. He thought that a better derision might be come to as to their punishment, by considering separately and severally the two cases; and he, therefore, regretted to hear a proposition which did not appear to him accordant to the principles of justice; namely, that punishment was to be awarded, not in proportion to the demerit of the offending party, but to the guilt of another wholly distinct; not only was Penryn to be more severely punished in consequence of the delinquency of East
<col>1324</col>
Retford, but East Retford was to suffer more severely from the guilt of Penryn. It was now, for the first time, recommended that, in extending the franchise to the hundreds, all those who had hitherto enjoyed the privilege of voters should be excluded. He considered the plan for throwing the franchise of a delinquent borough upon the hundreds was not so much with a view to protect the agricultural interest, as to preserve a due proportion between delinquency and punishment, by preserving the privileges of those voters who had not forfeited their franchise by corruption. This he took to be the design of the extension, and not any partial or jealous distinction between the agricultural and commercial interests. He was sorry that on this occasion that principle should be deviated from. The rights of election were by many thought of equal importance to the rights of property. He admitted that there was a distinction; yet the principle upon which they were founded was the same. They were given and preserved by the same laws, and he did not know how they could be separated in the consideration of this question. He confessed that in some cases, individual interests must be sacrificed for public advantage, but that ought to be done only on urgent necessity, nor ought that necessity to be unnecessarily provoked; which he thought would be the case if the resolution already formed by hon. members were abandoned, because it was found convenient to punish the borough for delinquency in another quarter. It appeared to him, on the statement made by the hon. member for Penryn, that this was not a case standing on its own merits. And if so, he could not consent to inflict a heavier punishment than the actual criminality would justify. He should therefore support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01143"><member>Mr. Batley</member><membercontribution> said, he would not vote for the absolute disfranchisement of Penryn. He could not consent to punish the innocent with the guilty, and should, therefore, support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01144"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that his hon. friend (Mr. G. Bankes) had completely mistaken what had fallen from him on a former evening, when he expressed his wish to postpone the declaration of his sentiments as to the transfer of the franchise of Penryn, until after the question respecting East Retford was disposed of. He then stated, that the transfer of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0670"/>
<col>1325</col>
franchise involved considerations of policy, and that he was desirous not to give an opinion with respect to any particular place, until the House had decided whether they had one or two to deal with. At that moment, however, he had made up his mind that the House was at liberty to deal with Penryn absolutely. The ground on which he had come to this I conclusion was this&#x2014;that on three several occasions there had been proof of corruption in Penryn. In 1807, the proceedings which took place in that borough were brought under the consideration of the House. Distinct allegations of corrupt practices were referred to a committee, appointed under the Grenville act: they examined witnesses on oath, and the report which they made to the House was conclusive as to the existence, to a certain extent, of corrupt practices. This, then, was a distinct warning to the borough, and those interested in the preservation of the franchise ought to have exerted themselves I to have prevented similar abuses in future, In 1819, again, complaints were repeated, I and the question was again referred to a committee, where it was proved that corrupt practices still continued in the borough, and the House expressed their opinion on the subject by passing a bill, disfranchising the borough. Here were two distinct warnings, and one went to the extent of a practical confiscation, which was a material point affecting the case. These warnings, however, were not sufficient, and at the last election a third complaint was made to the House; and in the course of the session the House, after hearing evidence at the bar&#x2014;particularly that of Mr. Stanbury&#x2014;and upon mature deliberation, acting judicially, came; to a resolution, declaring that there prevailed in Penryn that notorious corruption: which placed the franchise of the borough: at the disposal of the House; and that resolution they seconded by a solemn act; namely, the passing of the bill. It was evident that there must be some termination to proceedings of this kind. The House having declared that the borough ought to be disfranchised, could not be made a court of appeal against their own decision. He was not prepared to advise the House to revoke the solemn decision to which they had come by a majority of 114 to 33. He did not think such a course would add to the character of the House. If any person were to state that
<col>1326</col>
he could bring forward new evidence to overturn that which had been previously given, that might present new considerations to his mind; but he had heard nothing of the kind stated. At the present moment he trusted the House would deal with the case before them with the most rigid justice. Should the House agree to the original proposal for transferring the franchise to the large town, or great commercial place, the voters not disfranchised, it was obvious, would feel themselves very differently circumstanced, and placed in a very different relation from that in which they formerly stood. In fact they would only bear the numerical proportion of a hundred and fifty to two thousand, such being the disproportion between the number of the disfranchised voters and the number of new electors, or newly enfranchised persons, with whom they were intended to be amalgamated by the bill. He was still unaltered in his opinion, that substantial justice would not be done by extending, in this case, the franchise to the hundred. In the former case of a transfer so often alluded to in the course of the debate, the House had voted, that the forfeited franchise of the borough of Grampound should be transferred to Leeds; their lordships, however, subsequently determined, in the other House, that the franchise should be transferred to the county of York. As to the disfranchised parties, in either case it was almost, if not altogether, a matter of indifference to them who derived the benefit of this transfer of the franchise. The franchise was undoubtedly an enjoyment of a private right. In the case of the borough of Grampound both branches of the legislature, however, felt they could not do justice to the interests of the public, unless the electors were disfranchised. Whatever might be his opinion on other delinquent boroughs, he begged to state, that he never doubted that the House had a clear right to deal with the electors of Penryn from the notoriety of its corruption. The only doubt he had entertained was as to what was to be done with the forfeited franchise in this case, or to whom it was to be transferred. It was for the latter reason that when, during last session, this question was before the House, he, forming then no part of the ministry, had forborne to express his sentiments on this part of the duty of the legislature. As to the propriety of transferring the franchise of Penryn to the hundred&#x2014;
<image src="S2V0018P0I0671"/>
<col>1327</col>
and here he wished to be understood as saying nothing which could be inferred to allude to the case of the borough of East Retford&#x2014;he had formed his opinion, and made his mind up, from the thousand circumstances&#x2014;some even minute ones&#x2014;which were so often found in life to be the substantive grounds on which persons were often compelled to make up their minds on matters of even considerable importance. In the review of those circumstances he could not exclude from his mind the consideration, that the borough of Penryn was a Cornish borough, and that Cornwall had forty-two representatives in that House: and here he would observe, in answer to an appeal which had been made to the House, by the hon. President of the Royal Society, in favour of the representation of Cornwall&#x2014;let those persons whose interests were likely to be affected provide in future that their interests should be represented in parliament by competent persons. For himself, he should vote for the transfer of the franchise of Penryn to a large commercial community, because he considered it a fair line of conduct to pursue, as the House had now two delinquent boroughs to deal with, and with propriety, therefore, could adopt the principle of alternation in this particular instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01145"><member>Lord F. L. Gower</member><membercontribution> said, that opposed as he had generally been, on the question of reform in parliament, to many who had taken a part in the debate, he still thought that, in the present instance, a case had been made out for disfranchising this particular borough. He felt it his duty to defend his right hon. friend from the charge which had been made against him, by the hon. member for Corfe Castle, who described his right hon. friend as having waited to make up his mind upon the question, until the case of the delinquency of East Retford arose, so as to furnish himself with an argument to aggravate the offence of the former delinquency. Such an inference was unauthorized in fact, and unjust to his right hon. friend. The cases of these delinquent boroughs resembled very strikingly the cases of two persons found guilty of offences, which rendered them liable to the severest penalty the law could inflict. If, pursuant to that sentence, they were doomed to die, it was of little consequence to themselves how that sentence was executed, provided it were speedy, and un-
<col>1328</col>
marked by cruelty. But it was of great importance to the public how the sentence of the law was executed; for it might be, and often was, of consequence that such a mode should be adopted as might render the punishment an example to others. If, then, the House should determine in its wisdom, that one of these offending boroughs should be delivered over to be dissected after execution, and order the other to be hung in chains, no one could feel that the House had, in this case, exercised towards the parties an act of injustice.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CORPORATION AND TEST ACTS REPEAL BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01160">On the order of the day being read,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01161"><member>Lord John Russell</member><membercontribution> said.&#x2014;In rising to move that the House do now go into a committee on this important bill, I feel it necessary to say a few words. When it was last under discussion, upon the proposition of a right hon. gentleman opposite, seconded by the right hon. Secretary for the Home Department, for inserting a Declaration in it, to be taken by all Dissenters on their entry into office, I agreed to the principles on which they rested it, not because I thought it either necessary or important, but because I believed it to be likely to render the bill more satisfactory to all parties, and to prevent
<col>1330</col>
that collision of hostile feelings which, on points of religion, is of all things most to be avoided. With respect to the proposed Declaration, and to the clauses accompanying it, it was impossible for me then to agree to them, having heard them on that occasion for the first time, and being impressed with the feeling that it would be imprudent for me, on a question where the interests of so many were at stake, to allow myself to be concluded at once by any form of words. At the same time it appeared to me, that the proposition of the right hon. Secretary did not comprehend any thing in its terms unsuited to the object which I had in view. The points to which I felt myself bound to look were, that the Dissenters should not be restrained from the expression of their religious opinions; that they should not be molested for retaining them; and that they should not be prevented from teaching and inculcating them to others. In these respects, after deeply considering the Declaration proposed by the right hon. Secretary, I feel bound to say, that I do not find that it imposes any restraints on the religious liberty of individuals. It merely restrains them from exercising any influence which they may obtain, by virtue of any office to which they be appointed, to weaken the Established Church, or to subvert its legal rights and privileges. I therefore am of opinion, that it would be extremely unadvisable in me to propound or maintain any objection to the Declaration which has been proposed. On the contrary, I feel that it would be extremely wrong in me not to admit it into the bill as a very essential means of pacifying the country on this most important subject. In making this opinion known, I cannot but think it due to the right hon. Secretary to declare, that as far as I have observed his conduct on this bill, he has been most anxious to bring the question to such a point as may prevent the conscientious scruples of any Dissenter from being affected, and as may satisfy the Church that it need apprehend no injury from the admission of Dissenters into civil offices. Viewing the Declaration in this light, I shall offer no objection to the clauses of the right hon. Secretary; and I trust that when they are inserted into the bill in their amended form, they will render it acceptable, not only to this but to the other House of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01162">The House then went into the committee. On the second clause being read,</p>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0673"/>
<col>1331</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01163"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, the only objection which I have heard urged against the course which I recommended the House, on a former evening, to follow, arises out of this clause; and I am informed that it appears to some persons, to give the king a power to dispense with this Declaration. My opinion is, that it gives no such power: at any rate, I know that I did not intend that it should. The question, as far as it refers to this point, is not without its difficulties. By the law as it now stands, any one who enters into the king's service, or receives the king's wages, or acts as his menial servant, is compelled to take the Sacramental Test. He is relieved, however, from that compulsion by the Annual Indemnity act. If that act were not to be passed, he would be under an obligation to take the Sacramental Test, however menial the office might be in which he served his majesty. If I am entitled by the Test and Corporation Acts to call upon every person who enters his majesty's service to take the Sacramental Test, I am entitled, by the proposed act to make every person who would now be compelled to take that test make the proposed Declaration. Now, in many cases, the performance of such a ceremony would not only be superfluous, but absurd. For instance, what could be more useless and absurd than to make a man, who is going to enter upon office on a foreign station, make a declaration that he will not, by virtue of that office, attempt to subvert the privileges of the Church of England? It would be difficult to specify in words all the cases in which it would be imperative that the party should make the Declaration, and equally difficult to specify the cases where an exception to that rule ought to be allowed. The object of this clause was to enable his majesty at his discretion to specify those offices in which it would be necessary to exact the proposed Declaration. The object of it was, not to dispense with the Declaration entirely, but to allow his majesty to name what officers should and what officers should not be called upon to make it. This is all that I have to say on this subject at present. I will, however, repeat, that I am satisfied with the security which this Declaration offers. I am not prepared to make any alteration in it to please the wishes of any party. All that has passed since I proposed it, confirms me in the sanguine hope that the present session will
<col>1332</col>
not close without our having every question satisfactorily arranged, with respect to Dissenters from the Church of England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01164"><member>Lord Nugent</member><membercontribution> said, that the proposed Declaration was one of the mildest and least offensive that could have been devised: and that the right hon. Secretary merited the thanks of the country, for the manner in which he had acceded to the proposition of his noble friend. There was one point, however, which he wished to suggest. He thought that the office of privy councillor was one which subjected the holder of it to taking sacramental test.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01165"><member>Mr. Peel.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;He is covered by the annual bill of indemnity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01166"><member>Lord Nugent.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Exactly so: a privy councillor would be compelled, unless he were covered by the act of indemnity. If that were the case, then he would be called on to make the proposed Declaration. Assuming, then, that a privy councillor was both to take the sacramental test under the old bill, and therefore liable to make the Declaration under the present bill, there might be cases, and those not extreme ones, in which a man, not nicely scrupulous, but only properly conscientious, might find the Declaration to be at variance with the oath which he had taken as a privy councillor. The oath which a privy councillor took, bound him to advise the king according to the best of his discretion, and to observe, keep, and do all that a good and true councillor ought to do to his sovereign lord. Now, cases touching the disposal of church property might arise, in which the Declaration, which bound him not to employ the influence of his office to weaken the church establishment might be in direct opposition with the oath of a privy councillor, which bound him to advise for the king's honour and the good of the public. It might be supposed in such cases by conscientious men, that the Declaration was to supersede and ride over the oath which they had taken. He did not know whether the right hon. gentleman would make any exception in this clause on behalf of privy councillors; but it did appear to him that, as the clause now stood, it might excite some uneasiness in the minds of persons of tender consciences.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TURKEY AND RUSSIA.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01168"><member>Earl Grey</member><membercontribution>, seeing the noble Secretary for Foreign Affairs in his place, would ask him a question on a subject of the greatest importance. He had hitherto abstained from saying one word on the present situation of affairs in the east of Europe, not because he did not feel the utmost anxiety with respect to the determination of ministers relative to the state of affairs in that quarter of the globe, and the possible results which might issue from that state of things, but because he had been fearful of adding, by any thing he might say, to the difficulties in which he was too sensible ministers were placed on that subject;&#x2014;difficulties of such a nature, that one false step might risk our being involved in a general war; and he was not prepared to pronounce with any confidence, even now, that with the most cautious policy, we should be secured from that calamity. Under the influence of that feeling, he had hitherto abstained from saying one word on that important subject, wishing that ministers should be allowed time deliberately to examine the situation they were placed in. The same feeling would have induced him to pursue on the present occasion, the same conduct, if there had not been made very recently, under the highest authority, a statement, which, if correctly reported, could not be too speedily confirmed; but which, if otherwise, ought, in order to obviate the inconveniences which might follow, to be as speedily corrected. The statement he alluded to was to the following effect,&#x2014;"That ministers had received no information of any change having taken place in the relations existing between Russia and the Ottoman Porte, or any declaration of war between those parties." That there had been no actual declaration of war, either communicated to his majesty's ministers, or in fact issued, he certainly believed; but he could easily understand, that short of a declaration of war there might be a change in the relations existing between two powers not less material than if war had actually taken place. If measures had been entered into&#x2014;if treaties had been broken&#x2014;if troops had been assembled and placed in hostile positions, from which they might act&#x2014;and if a declaration had been made to ministers of a determination to act immediately
<col>1334</col>
in enforcing demands with which the Porte had not hitherto been disposed to comply, no one would contend that a most material change had not taken place in the situation of affairs between Russia and the Porte, since the commencement of the present session; when the Speech from the Throne stated, after speaking of the occurrence at Navarino, that notwithstanding that action, his majesty "still entertains a confident hope that this untoward event will not be followed by further hostilities." Now, that hope could not be said to exist, if there was a declaration, though short of a declaration of war, authoritatively and officially made, expressing any intention which would make a speedy termination of the state of peace inevitable. He therefore wished ministers to state, as far as they could consistently with their duty, whether he was to understand by those words, that there had been no change in the relations subsisting between Russia and the Porte, to diminish that hope of the continuance of peace.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01169"><member>The Earl of Dudley</member><membercontribution> said, he was extremely anxious to give their lordships and the public all the satisfaction that he could consistently with his duty, on that most important subject to which the noble lord had alluded; but he trusted the noble earl would be satisfied when he told him, for the present, that certain intentions had been announced on the part of Russia, which very much diminished the chance of maintaining the existing peace between Russia and the Porte. Government, however, had as yet received no accounts of those intentions having been carried into effect. That the hope of maintaining peace between Russia and the Porte had much diminished since his Majesty's communication was made to their lordships on the first day of the session, there was no doubt; but no account had yet been received of peace having been actually violated.</membercontribution></p>

The offence for which you were committed to his Majesty's Gaol of Newgate was for attempting by gross falsehood to obstruct, and, if possible, to defeat, an examination in which this House was engaged; an attempt as unavailing and as scandalous in itself as it was insulting to this House, and subversive of its privileges.<lb/>
"In your Petition you express a hope that the time during which you have been imprisoned in Newgate may be considered as an expiation of your offence. I know not upon what grounds you entertain such hope. This House can, and in pity to your wife and children will, release you from further imprisonment, but the expiation of your offence must depend on your future conduct. By honesty, industry, and integrity, you can alone hope to obliterate that stain from your character which you have yourself inflicted on it, and to become a support instead of a disgrace and burthen to your family. I am now to acquaint you, that you are discharged from further confinement."</p>

<title>DUTY ON INSURANCES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01171"><member>Mr. Alderman Thompson</member><membercontribution> rose to present a petition from the Insurance Offices of London and Westminster. It was signed by two chartered companies&#x2014;the Royal Exchange and the London Assurance&#x2014;and by fifteen other bodies of the same kind, which had been established with a capital of many millions. They contended, that the rate of duty on Fire Insurances had sensibly affected their progress, and lessened the amount of property that would otherwise have been insured; they confidently believed that a reduction of the duty would increase the practice of Insurance, and thus indemnify the country from any loss in the revenue. The duty amounted to a tax in some cases of one hundred per cent. The subject was of vast importance, not only to the petitioners but to the public at large; and when it was stated that an insurer to the extent of 20<i>s.</i> paid 40<i>s.</i> duty upon his policy, it would be obvious how much it must obstruct insurances, and the effect was, to increase the destruction of property and the loss to individuals, especially in the middle classes of society. The duty first imposed in 1782, amounted to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per cent.; in 1798, it was increased to 2<i>s.</i>; in 1804, to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and in 1816, to 3<i>s.</i> According to returns
<col>1336</col>
before the House, the number of inhabited houses in England, Wales, and Scotland in 1801, was one million five hundred and seventy-five thousand two hundred and thirty; in 1811, it had increased to two million one hundred and one thousand houses; and in 1821, to two million four hundred and twenty nine thousand six hundred and thirty houses. The amount of duty paid in England, Wales, and Scotland upon insurances from fire, was 547,845<i>l.,</i> which covered property to the extent of about 400,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling. This sum might appear large, yet it was, in fact, small, compared with the real amount of capital invested. According to the best calculation, 400,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling was not more than one third, or one fourth of the property in England, Wales, and Scotland, liable to be destroyed by fire. The petitioners were unanimously of opinion, therefore, that if the duty were reduced to one half, insurances would be greatly multiplied, and the revenue increased; that it would be followed, in short, by the same results that had attended the reduction of duty upon wine, coffee, and other articles; while private losses and distress would thereby be greatly avoided. The Royal Exchange and London Assurance Companies also dealt in marine risks, the duty upon which, in 1814, amounted to not less than 485,066<i>l.</i>, which had been gradually reduced, until, in 1826, it had fallen to 219,629<i>l.</i> The cause of this diminution was very obvious&#x2014;that Insurance Offices had been established on various parts of the continent, and in the United States of America. The premium in London upon a policy from London to Calais, was 5<i>s.</i> per 100<i>l.,</i> and upon 10,000<i>l.</i> the amount of premium would be 25<i>l.</i>, and the duty upon it no less than 12<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> Bullion was the great article of commerce between London and Calais, and as there was no corresponding duty in France, what cost here 37<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> for the insurance, might there be done for 25<i>l.</i> The same proportions were kept in the insurances to Holland; the premium being 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per cent and the duty as before 12<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> On a voyage to the United States, the duty was 21<i>s.</i> per 100<i>l.,</i> and the duty upon it twenty per cent. The hon. member then read a letter from a large manufacturer of Birmingham, complaining that the heavy duty operated most grievously upon all shipments to the United States, and was a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0676"/>
<col>1337</col>
sufficient inducement to merchants in America to effect insurances at home instead of ordering them to be made in England. The writer added, that two thirds of the shipments now making for the United States were insured there. The hon. alderman also stated, that a house in London, which formerly effected insurances in London for a mercantile establishment in Amsterdam to the extent of 6,000<i>l.</i> per annum, now did no business of the kind for it, all the insurances being effected in Holland. The merchants in London were thus deprived of a considerable branch of business, and government of a large amount of revenue. He hoped he had stated enough to induce the Chancellor of the Exchequer to turn his serious attention to the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01172"><member>Mr. Alderman C. Smith</member><membercontribution> supported the prayer of the petition, and expressed his hope that ministers would find themselves warranted in reducing the duty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01173"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that as the hon. alderman had confined himself to requesting the full consideration of the subject, he had no hesitation in assuring him, not only that he would do so, but that he had already taken measures to ascertain the facts of the case as far as regarded marine insurances, in order to decide whether the duty could be reduced without injury to the revenue. The income derived from the duty on insurances exceeded a million, and it would be the height of imprudence to give the House or individuals an expectation that it would be possible to make any arrangement which might put in hazard that amount of revenue. As to fire assurances, when the hon. member stated, that the amount of duty at present was such as to impede the insurance of property, the data before the House did not warrant such a position. The amount of duty on fire assurances had been regularly progressive; and whatever the check might have been on the ordinary principles governing financial arrangements, it had not been sufficient to put a stop to the increase. In one year it was 600,000<i>l.</i>; in the next, 613,000<i>l.</i>; in the next, 620,000<i>l.</i>; in the next, 627,000<i>l.</i>; in the next, 659,000<i>l.</i>; in the next, 692,000<i>l.</i>; and in the last instance, 727,000<i>l.</i>;&#x2014;without a single intermission of progress, or any thing like a decrease. He must deny that the amount had not considerably increased with the extension of property; for instance, in three years after the 3<i>s.</i> duty had been imposed, there had been
<col>1338</col>
an increase of 100,000<i>l.,</i> showing that 60,000,000<i>l.</i> or 70,000,000<i>l.</i> of additional property must have been insured at the offices during that period. Although he agreed that the increase of capital had been great within the time mentioned, the increase of insurances to which he had alluded was great also. With respect to marine insurances, he believed they had in some degree decreased; in the comparison between the years 1826 and 1814; but if his hon. friend took the average of the last six years, with those of the preceding six, and then referred further back, pursuing the same relative scale of average, he would find that the declension had not occurred in the degree he had supposed. It was quite evident that in a time of peace this business could not be carried to the same extent as during a war. Now, in the last year, insurances had been effected upon 92,000,000<i>l.</i> of property; in 1812, the last year of the war, insurances had been only effected upon 93,000,000<i>l.</i>; thus showing only a difference of one million in the amount covered during these relative periods. He was here speaking of the London business; for they had no other returns before them. He would turn his best attention to the subject, to see if any new arrangement could be made for the satisfaction of the parties; but when his hon. friend said that British insurances would be transferred abroad, if the duty were not lowered, he seemed to forget the superior security which was assigned to the character of the British merchant, and the greater facility for the recovery of these losses in the tribunals of this country. He believed that, in many instances, insurances had been effected abroad, but not to the extent which had been supposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01174"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> remarked upon the want of the relative proportion of property insured, to the general increase of property. Before the year 1814, the insurance duty amounted to 514,000<i>l.</i>; and in 1824 it was 631,000<i>l.</i> [The Chancellor of the Exchequer here said, that it had afterwards increased to 727,000<i>l.</i>] He called upon the right hon. gentleman to bear in mind, that houses were the principal property insured, and it was obvious that, when the rate became so high, the owners of them preferred incurring their own risk, and they therefore generally omitted the rebuilding clause in their leases; by which they put into their
<image src="S2V0018P0I0677"/>
<col>1339</col>
pockets, as landlords, three times the amount of their risk. That was the main reason why the amount of the fair insurances had diminished. With reference to the impolicy of these high duties, he rather thought that while the insurance offices were proceeding in this way, they were also engaged in a sort of juggle with the government, to introduce compulsory clauses in the bill for marking policies. With respect to the foreign insurance companies, they were of the highest character.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01175"><member>Mr. Sykes</member><membercontribution> called, the attention of the government to the marine insurances, from their manifest operation upon the shipping interest, which was already so seriously, and he feared dangerously, restricted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01176"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, he could not agree with the chancellor of the Exchequer in the propriety of this tax, which he had always looked upon as a grievance. It was a tax upon the prudence and providence of persons in trade, and as objectionable an impost as could well have been introduced. He believed that the amount of the rate imposed diminished the desire to insure. He, for instance, would never himself insure his own property on any large scale, because the price to be paid greatly exceeded the ratio of the risk. He wished to suggest to the chancellor of the Exchequer the risk he ran of having this business transferred to Ostend, or some of the opposite ports, where, through British capital and agents, it might be done so as materially to affect the revenue here.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REAL PROPERTY IN INDIA.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01178"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> rose to present a petition of which he had given notice, from the British, native, and other inhabitants of Calcutta, respecting the law of Real Property within that settlement, and particularly respecting the liability of such property in the hands of executors and administrators to the payment of the debts of the deceased. This petition, which was signed, he believed, by almost every person of respectability and opulence in Calcutta, complained of the imperfect and unsettled state of the law in that particular, arising chiefly from some late decisions of the Supreme Court, affecting property to the amount of many millions sterling.&#x2014;The petition stated, that previously to the granting by his majesty Of the charter of the Supreme Court, in
<col>1340</col>
1774, houses and lands of British subjects were liable to be seized and sold for the payment of debts, as well in the hands of the owner in his life-time, as of his executor or administrator after his decease. The letters patent or charter of justice, of 1774, recognized this to be the law; for after giving to the Supreme Court the power to try and determine actions and suits of a personal nature, and "all rights, titles, claims and demands, of, in, and to, any houses, lands, or other things, real or personal," within the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, against his majesty's subjects, and against the executors and administrators of such his subjects, it authorizes the same court to give judgment in such actions, and thereupon to award and issue writs of execution, commanding the sheriff to seize, and deliver possession of houses, lands, and other things recovered by such judgment; or to levy any sums of money recovered by such judgment, by seizing and selling so much of the houses, lands, debts, or other effects, of the party against whom such writs shall have been awarded, as shall be sufficient to satisfy such judgment. The petition stated that it was the meaning and intention of this provision in the letters patent, to place houses and lands on the same footing with personality as to liability for debts, either in the life-time or after the death of the debtor, and that such had always been considered to be the law, and never had been doubted until lately, when in a case decided in the Supreme Court, sir Charles Grey, the chief justice, had declared it to be his opinion, that such estates being of inheritance, which he thought British subjects might hold in Calcutta, were no assets in the hands of an executor or administrator for the payment of debts; and that, if liable for the debts of the deceased at all, they were liable in the hands of the heir, who was the person to be sued, and not the executor or administrator. The other two judges, however, sir Anthony Buller and sir John Franks, were of opinion that such estates were liable to the payment of such debts, and were assets for that purpose in the hands of the executor or administrator, who might lawfully sell and convey the same.&#x2014;The judgment of the court was given in favour of such power, but the petition stated, that such was the alarm created by the effect of the opinion given by the chief justice, joined to a decision which had subsequently taken
<image src="S2V0018P0I0678"/>
<col>1341</col>
place respecting a claim of dower, that the sale of houses and lands by executors and administrators had been wholly suspended, and that all titles to houses and lands which had ever been conveyed by an executor or administrator were rendered liable to objections and doubts. He (Mr. Fergusson) could well conceive this, for he had no hesitation in saying that if the law was, as laid down by the chief justice, of whose talents and learning he could not speak otherwise than with respect, it would go to shake almost every title in Calcutta. In the course of a long practice, in which numerous tales had come under his (Mr. Fergusson's) consideration, he scarcely remembered one in which some link in the chain of title did not consist of a conveyance from an executor or administrator. He (Mr. Fergusson) could safely say, that during a practice of seventeen years, he had never heard either at the bar or from the bench, a doubt thrown upon the law, that an executor or administrator had a power to sell an estate in lands or houses, whether of inheritance or not, for the payment of the debts generally of the deceased, and that such estate was assets in his hands for that purpose. The case of dower referred to in that petition, was one in which the chief justice and sir John Franks, the only two judges who then constituted the court, concurred in holding, that the lands of a British subject in Calcutta could not be sold, either in his life-time or after his death, for the payment of his debts, unless subject to the right of dower. This was, certainly, the first decision that had been given in the Supreme Court in favour of dower, as a claim preferable to debts; and the petitioners contended that by the law and practice which had at all times obtained, lands had been seized, and sold by the sheriff under writ of <i>fieri facias,</i> as well in the lifetime of the owner as (after his death) in the hands of his executors or administrators for the payment of debts, and that no reservation had ever been made or claimed to be made on account of dower.&#x2014;Whatever might be the law on this point, it would seem that, for the future at least, it would be most desirable that in a commercial community like Calcutta, the transfer of landed property, particularly for the payment of debts, should be entirely freed from this charge, and the rather as by the bankrupt law, the real estate of a bankrupt situate in any part of
<col>1342</col>
the dominions of the Crown passed by the assignment and became liable to the payment of the bankrupt's debts discharged from all claim of dower. There was another judgment of the Supreme Court mentioned in the petition, which was the unanimous judgment of the three judges, but in which the point was decided for the first time, that an alien could not take lands by descent in Calcutta. From the protection afforded by the British government to persons residing within its territories it was certain the subjects of foreign states had been induced to resort to and settle in Calcutta, and had purchased lands and houses which had descended to their heirs, as the petition stated, without let or hindrance. In the two first charters, which were granted in the reigns of George 1st and 2nd it was recited, that the "United Company had, by strict and equal distribution of justice, very much encouraged not only his Majesty's subjects, but likewise the subjects of other countries, and the natives of the adjacent countries, to resort to and settle in Calcutta." This was a point of great importance, and which involved questions of general consideration; and he (Mr. Fergusson) was sensible that if any thing was to be done to alter or affect the law on this subject, it must be under an express sanction of the Crown. There was one remaining point noticed in this petition, which was also of great interest, he meant the want of a proper law respecting insolvent debtors, whereby many persons were imprisoned for a great length of years in the gaol of Calcutta, although they had no means of discharging their debts, and had delivered up all they possessed. He (Mr. F.) understood that a bill for the purpose of remedying this evil was now in preparation, under the sanction of the Court of Directors and the Board of Control. This subject he did not therefore mean to include in the bill, which it was his intention, after presenting this petition, to move the House for leave to bring in. He thought he had said enough to satisfy the House that the law, and the very important subject to which he had called their attention, ought not to be suffered to remain in its present unsettled and imperfect state; he did not, therefore, anticipate any objection to the motion of which he had given notice for that evening. In the mean time he would content himself with moving for leave to bring up the petition.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01179"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> expressed his satisfaction at seeing the subject taken up by the learned gentleman, and proceeded to comment upon the want of attention towards the affairs of India in general. They had a Board of Control; but he was at a loss to discover in what respect that Board devoted their attention to India. The members of it were often turned out in the course of a year, not because they were unfit for the office, but because they belonged to one or other political party. His majesty's government, in looking back for a series of years, should take shame to themselves for the manner in which they had conducted the government of India, and for the way in which that Board of Control, which presided over a hundred million of men, had been constituted and maintained. He condemned the restrictions which existed upon the commerce and intercourse between this country and our Indian possessions. Those possessions were full of wealth, and abounded in large tracts of rich and unoccupied land. Why not remove these absurd restrictions, encourage emigration thither, and, instead of sending English capital to the various countries of South America, allow it to be employed freely and advantageously in India? He trusted that the learned gentleman would go on with the subject which he had taken up. He might look for the support of that House, and of public opinion out of doors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01180"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> said, that so far as he had communicated with the Board of Control, he had found on the part of its members, and particularly on the part of the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Wynn), its late president, the greatest facility and attention afforded to him. Indeed, the right hon. gentleman had upon all occasions exhibited the most sincere intentions and assiduous zeal for the promotion of the interests of India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01181"><member>Mr. Trant</member><membercontribution> agreed with the hon. member in the propriety of the measure he wished to introduce. In his opinion there ought to be a discussion every year in the affairs of India, similar to that introduced by the late lord Melville when he brought forward his yearly Budget. Such discussions tended greatly to enlighten public opinion upon the subject of India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01182"><member>Mr. T. P. Courtenay</member><membercontribution> defended the Board of Control from the reflections of the hon. member (for Aberdeen), and de-
<col>1344</col>
clared, that he never recollected any man who had attended with more assiduity, he might even say affection, to the concerns of the people of India, than the late right hon. president. After observing that there had always been an understanding that the law of India was such as the hon. gentleman stated it to be, although it was not supported by the strict form of expression in the charter, the hon. gentleman expressed a hope that the member for Aberdeen would bring his charge against the Board of Control before the House in the form of a motion. Nothing could give him more pleasure than to meet the charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01183"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, that, during the time he had been connected with the Board of Control, he had commissioned a chief justice who was sent out from this country to collect information respecting the propriety of introducing the Insolvent Debtors' laws there. That learned judge, however, fell a victim to disease in about six months after his arrival in India, and consequently the desired information was not collected. Great difference of opinion existed on the subject in India. If it could be done, he was of opinion that it would be better effected by some species of regulations respecting debtors there, than by any legislative enactment here. The draught of a bill upon the subject had arrived in this country a few days previous to his leaving office, and he recommended to the noble lord, now at the head of the Board of Control, to have the matter laid before the law officers of the Crown. Perhaps it might be supposed that he (Mr. Wynn) would be most competent to introduce the subject to the consideration of the House; and if that were the case, he should be very happy to do so.<lb/>
The petition was ordered to lie on the table; and Mr. Fergusson obtained leave to bring in a bill "to explain and amend the Law respecting Real Property belonging to British Subjects and others within the jurisdiction of His Majesty's Courts in India, and the liability of such property as assets (in the hands of Executors and Administrators) to the payment of the debts of deceased persons."</membercontribution></p>

<title>LIFE ANNUITIES REPEAL BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01184">On the order of the day for the third reading of this bill,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01185"><member>Lord Althorpe</member><membercontribution> wished to offer a very few words upon this bill, because he
<image src="S2V0018P0I0680"/>
<col>1345</col>
thought that, in the discussion which had taken place last night, Mr. Finlayson had been rather hardly dealt with. All the statement about the country losing 100,000<i>l.</i> a-week was a great exaggeration of Mr. Finlayson's reckoning; and he therefore wished to explain the principle upon which Mr. Finlayson's calculation had proceeded. Mr. Finlayson, on looking to the annuities which were outstanding on the 5th Jan., 1827, and the 5th of Jan., 1828, conceived, upon a comparison of the two periods, that the public would lose about 95,000<i>l.</i> per annum, which sum would be equivalent to a loss of about 8,000<i>l.</i> per month. Now, the mode in which this gentleman arrived at his deductions was this:&#x2014;He assumed the amount of the existing annuities, and calculated that the whole amount of them would not be extinguished until about sixty years from the present time; that is, that the last or longest life would, in all probability, subsist for sixty years to come. His calculation, therefore, respected the final result of this financial operation at the end of such period of sixty years. He assumed the average duration of each life to be so many years, and the interest of money at four and a half per cent. Working his calculation upon these data, from the 5th of January, Mr. Finlayson assumed that at the end of sixty years there would be redeemed 32,000,000<i>l.</i> less of the national debt, through the operation of this measure for granting life annuities, than would have been redeemed if all the stock which had been given for effecting this measure had been accumulating during the whole of the same period under the working of the Sinking-fund. Upon a similar calculation, as to the 5th of April, he reckoned that in sixty years from that day the public would be still the worse by 95,000<i>l.</i>; that is to say, that there would be 95,000<i>l.</i> less redeemed of annuities; that an aggregate sum of 32,000,000<i>l. plus</i> this 95,000<i>l.</i> would be redeemed less at the close of that period, than would have been redeemed by the Sinking-fund. With regard to another point which supplied a sort of test of the degree of accuracy with which this calculation had been made; namely, what had been the result of the first year in which these life annuities had been granted, an hon. friend of his had charged Mr. Finlayson, last night, with having omitted to give credit for the interest on the accumulation of the stock. Now, in this respect, his hon.
<col>1346</col>
friend must have misunderstood Mr. Finlayson; for Mr. Finlayson had taken into calculation the whole of the interest on the accumulations of stock, which had taken place during the last two years, and he found that a sum equal to 10,579<i>l.</i> three and a half per cents was the amount of the diminution of the debt beyond that which this operation would effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01186"><member>Mr. Hudson Gurney</member><membercontribution> said, it was quite apparent, from the statement of the noble lord, that Mr. Finlayson, like all other calculators, assumed something which experience taught us never happened, and which, in the end, invariably proved, that all their calculations were not worth a straw; and the greatest of all their assumptions had perpetually been, that by tricks with figures, they could reduce a debt which had gone on constantly increasing, and which, it was idle to hope, would ever be redeemed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01187"><member>Mr. Herries</member><membercontribution> said, that no person could purchase an annuity who was under thirty-five years of age. It had been insinuated, that he had attacked the professional character of Mr. Finlayson; but he had done no such thing. On the contrary, he had borne his humble testimony to the merits of Mr. Finlayson. There was one important point connected with this subject, which was worthy the attention of the House. He alluded to the fact, that a very material and gratifying change had taken place in this country, with respect to the average duration of human life. The tables published by order of the House exhibited this in a remarkable degree. These tables proved the extraordinary fact, that, in the course of the last forty years, such a change had taken place in the condition of the people, that the decrease of mortality in Great Britain was from one in forty to one in fifty-six. This was one of the strongest proofs that could be adduced to show the improvement in the state of the country. No proposition to which statesmen or philosophers could have recourse could more decidedly manifest progressive improvement than an increase of the population, and a decrease of human mortality. He thought it right to bring this under the consideration of the House, because it was connected intimately with the formation of tables to which allusion had been made. The increased longevity of the people, so far as these annuities went, might in some degree interfere with the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0681"/>
<col>1347</col>
public interest, but still it must be a source of gratification to all who took a correct view of the subject. It might also be proper to observe, that, from all the <i>data</i> which had been examined, for the purpose of ascertaining the difference between the value of male and female life, it was found to be one-tenth in favour of female life.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01188"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, it was true that a change had taken place in the duration of life during the last thirty years; but the right hon. gentleman seemed to have forgotten, that much of that was owing to the introduction of vaccination, and other modern improvements in medicine. But if they looked back to the forty years that preceded 1790, they would find, that there had always been some epidemic or other. In the year 1782, an epidemic had occurred, which spread itself throughout Europe, and had been felt most severely. For the last thirty years they had been free from such scourges; but that was no reason why such an event should not occur again. He hoped ministers would not allow much time to intervene without reviewing the tables upon which this, bill was founded. With the assistance of proper tables, the annuities' system would be a most effective mode of reducing a national debt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01189"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> deprecated the system of annuities, as acted upon up to the present time, and called the attention of the House to the Irish Tontine of 1773, 1775, and 1777; of which, owing to the bad system pursued, not one class was yet extinct; which shewed how guarded government ought to be in taking a step of this kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01190"><member>Mr. Monck</member><membercontribution> said, that the chief error of the government in granting those annuities had been in following the Northampton tables; which certainly were those used by the Equitable Insurance office, but for a very different purpose from that in which they were employed by the state. That office used them for granting payments at the end of life, while the government used them for granting annuities during life; it therefore was clear, that whatever was gain to the Insurance office was loss to the country. He agreed, that it was quite necessary that new tables should be calculated; but at the same time trusted that the annuity system would not be abandoned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01193"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> said, he had sufficient experience in that House to know, that if he put off the second reading until after the holydays, he could not carry the bill through afterwards. The most suitable way would be for those who objected to the bill, to let it pass the present stage, and take the discussion on the motion for going into a committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01194"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> confessed he had not yet been able to give the bill all the attention it deserved. From what he had seen of it, however, he thought that many of its regulations would disappoint the expectations of the noble lord. Instead of saving expense he thought it would effect a perpetual system of taxation. In the present state of the House, he wished the merits of the bill not to be brought under discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01195"><member>Lord Lowther</member><membercontribution> expressed his determination to oppose the bill, because it was a most impolitic measure, and would make the law more complicated and expensive than it now was. He was also greatly afraid of the noble lord's committee, when he saw the hon. baronet (sir J. Graham), the great reprehender of committees, upon it. Words had been put into the mouth of an eminent solicitor which he had never uttered. That gentleman was represented to have said, that, in a great contest, one third of the votes sent to the assessor were objected to, on the ground of the land-tax. Now he believed that the proportion of votes disputed was never even one tenth, and he had found that there was no instance in which one-tenth of the votes had been questioned. The only case that approximated to this calculation was that of his own election for Westmoreland, in which every vexatious objection that the ingenuity of man could devise was urged, and yet, in that case the proportion was only one twelfth; and in that of Devonshire, the next in degree, one twenty-eighth. The effect of this bill would be, to establish throughout the year one continued election contest. It would exclude all minor voters, and throw the representation into the hands of the wealthy freeholders. The bill was only a copy of Mr. Bearcroft's bill in 1788, which was just as complicated a measure as this. The payment of the land-tax had been found by experience to be the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0682"/>
<col>1349</col>
best criterion of the possession of the property qualifying a man to vote as a freeholder. For these reasons, and for others with which he would not detain the House, he would move, that the second reading be postponed for six months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01196"><member>Sir James Graham</member><membercontribution> denied that he had ever treated committees with contempt. He thought no measure could be rendered perfect without the labours of a committee. The noble lord had referred to the evidence of an eminent solicitor. Now, he knew that solicitor to be a gentleman of unimpeachable veracity, and he had said, that one third of the votes that went to the assessor in the contest at Glocester arose out of the land-tax. At Westmoreland, that gentleman had said that one out of eleven were objected to on the same score. He must contend that this bill was much less complicated than the present law. Serjeant Heywood, a good authority, had said, that the land-tax bill had raised more doubts upon the law of election than all the other enactments put together. The noble lord had expressed the most fastidious jealousy lest this bill should increase the expense of election. He was bound to believe the noble lord sincere, but he was quite sure he was wrong. His noble friend, the member for York, had expended 120,000<i>l.,</i> without polling a single vote. As to the effect which the noble lord contended the bill would have, of throwing the influence into the hands of powerful families, and excluding the 40<i>s.</i> voters, he was sure that no such principle would be listened to by that House. The effect of the bill would be to give extension to the elective franchise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01197"><member>The Attorney-General</member><membercontribution> objected to the bill, though he admitted it was strongly recommended, as coming from the noble lord. But the principle was, that the constituent body should not be exposed to expense and litigation in defence of their rights. He admitted that, if any steps for that purpose could be taken preliminary to an election, much might be done to reduce expenses; but this bill did not profess any such intention. It established an operose course of inquiry into the validity of voters, which was to be repeated every year. No person was to be allowed to vote, unless his name was in the register. If <i>&#x00E0; priori,</i> any elector could know whether a contest would take place, he might decide whe-
<col>1350</col>
ther he would put himself to the trouble and expense of going through the ordeal of this bill but not otherwise. He objected to the enormous expense and inconvenience which the complicated provisions of the bill would impose upon the constituent body. To the principle of the bill he was favourable. He was satisfied of the intention of the noble lord to accomplish a practical good; and, if it were divested of the cumbrous machinery with which it was at present embarrassed, he should be glad to co-operate with the noble lord in the object he had in view. The practice of serving a summons on non-resident voters, the power which the bill proposed to invest in under-sheriffs, and the various and intricate modes proposed for procuring the requisite tests of qualification, as freeholders, constituted the objectionable parts of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01198"><member>Lord Althorp</member><membercontribution> maintained that the bill, by lessening the duration of the poll at county elections, would materially lessen their expense. This was a result no less desirable to voters than to candidates, for at present the enormous expense of standing for a county often left the freeholders scarcely any choice as to their representative.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01199">After a few observations from colonel Wood, Mr. Dickenson, Mr. Marshall, and Mr. Hobhouse, the House divided:&#x2014;For the amendment 17; against it 32; Majority 15. The bill was then read a second time.</p>

<title>CANADA COMPANY.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01200"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> rose to submit a motion for information regarding the Canada Company, but begged to be distinctly understood, as not meaning to cast any reflection either upon the company collectively, or upon the individuals composing it. His object was, merely that the House should be in possession of all the knowledge it could acquire, before it came to any decision on the subject of emigration. He believed that when the company was formed, the House was not at all aware of the terms: an act was passed to enable the government to grant a charter, but parliament was not made acquainted with the extent of the capital, or with any of the conditions. In the Prospectus, it
<image src="S2V0018P0I0683"/>
<col>1351</col>
was proposed that a capital of one million should be raised; and with such a sum it was natural to suppose that emigration to a considerable extent would be promoted. The fact, however, was, that only 100,000<i>l</i>. had been obtained, and it had been stipulated that 50,000<i>l</i>. only should be laid out on the land, and the rest paid to government. The grant seemed to have been most improvident; for the money was to be paid by instalments, and those instalments were spread over sixteen years. He could understand from experience&#x2014;and the best of all experience, because he had paid for it&#x2014; that it was utterly impossible that the individuals concerned in the speculation could obtain any remuneration; for it was idle to suppose that persons who emigrated would be in a condition to pay for the land. If the parties entitled were upon the spot, they might, indeed, in two or three years, be paid in produce, but otherwise it was out of the question. There was one essential point to be considered. When it was proposed to send persons out to Canada, it was quite clear, from papers before the House, that it could not be done with respect to mere paupers, who would be worse off there than in this country, and it would cost an immense sum for government, at the rate of 50<i>l</i>. or 60<i>l</i>. each person, to send out even those who had a small capital: that plan was neither prudent nor practicable. He should also like to know how and on what terms government could grant the land to the company. It had been granted at the rate of 3<i>s</i>. and 3<i>l</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per acre, and the company proposed to sell it to individuals, to whom they did not advance 6<i>d</i>. to enable them to emigrate, at the rate of 10<i>s</i>. per acre, while for what were called town-lots the company was to receive for every quarter of an acre, in some cases 20<i>s</i>., in others 30<i>s</i>., and in others 40<i>s</i>. This appeared a most enormous profit, and if it were to be had, he saw no reason why government should not have obtained it. At one period, the shares of the company, which were originally 10<i>l</i>., advanced to a premium above the cost price of 36<i>l</i>., and even afterwards, when many relinquished their shares, owing to the revocation of the original grant by government, the shares were still sold at a profit of 8<i>l</i>. upon 10<i>l</i>. He did not charge the company with having taken any undue means to impose upon
<col>1352</col>
the public, but he saw no reason why government was to obtain no profit upon this grant of a million of acres, which was to be so advantageous to the company. Besides, having sold the land, how could the government with fairness send out other emigrants to enter into competition with the company? He believed, however, that the whole project was fallacious, and that it would end to the advantage of nobody concerned in it. With a view to putting the House in possession of all necessary information regarding the contract and the progress of the undertaking, he moved that there be laid before the House "an Account of the quantity of land in Upper Canada sold to the Canada Company, stating the terms and conditions of such sale; the sum of money paid in conformity thereto; the number of persons sent out to Canada by the company; the times when they were sent out; the quantity of land appropriated to them, with the price paid or to be paid for the same."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01201"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, that as he was connected with the Colonial Department at the date of this transaction, he would merely say a few words, leaving it to the Secretary of State either to give or withhold the account required. He might, indeed, incidentally mention, that the House was already in possession of half the information the hon. alderman wished to obtain: the terms of the contract with the company had been printed, and in the hands of members for some years. As to what the Canada Company had done, he did not know what power the House possessed to compel that body to disclose in what manner its business had been conducted. He had that morning read over four closely-printed folio pages of a Prospectus, detailing all the proceedings of the company, from its creation to the present hour, and from thence, he thought, the hon. alderman might have obtained all he desired on the second branch of his inquiry. The consistency of the argument of the hon. alderman he could not understand; first, he had contended, that the Canada Company had obtained an enormous profit, which ought to have come into the hands of government; and next he had insisted that the whole project was fallacious, and that the loss to the individuals engaged in it would be enormous. With respect to the high premium on the shares, it was quite cer-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0684"/>
<col>1353</col>
tain that no person connected with the Colonial Department had participated in any of the advantages thus acquired. The price of the land sold had been settled by commissioners after they had taken the utmost pains, with every facility, to arrive at a just conclusion. He hoped that the undertaking would be ultimately beneficial to the company, because he was sure that all the ingredients of wealth were to be found in the cultivation of that land, and in the encouragement of colonization. It was in the power of any hon. member to investigate whether government had or had not made an improvident bargain; but neither he nor the House had a right to interfere with the private details and affairs of the company.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01202"><member>Mr. Bright</member><membercontribution> hoped that the members of the company would make fortunes, but recommended the government to take care that the terms of the bargain were exactly fulfilled. It was of the utmost consequence, that from time to time, the House should make itself acquainted with the proceedings of the company; especially with a view to the general question of emigration. He, therefore, hoped that no technical objection would be thrown in the way of the production of the account required. In Canada there was a proportion of land, called Crown and Clergy Reserves, and as they most injuriously interfered with the prosperity of the colony, by preventing communication between one part and another, he wished to know whether any of those Reserves had been extirpated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01203"><member>Mr. W. Horton</member><membercontribution> replied, that there was already before the House a bill, which had for its object the progressive abolition of the Clergy Reserves. The Crown Reserves were also in a course of extinction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01204"><member>Mr. Easthope</member><membercontribution> assured the House, on behalf of the Canada Company, that it had not the slightest objection to the fullest investigation of its concerns. The hon. alderman had spoken of the enormous profits of the company. He could inform the House, that the shares were at that moment at fifty per cent discount. Nothing could be further from the intentions of the company than a desire to avoid the bargain into which they had entered. It was not the purpose of the Canada Company to do more than to place the lands purchased from government at the disposal of such persons as might be inclined to take them. The company went through
<col>1354</col>
the preliminary steps necessary to a settlement. They did all that could be done by limited capital; and which must be done before the land could be available for any profitable purpose. Such was the object of the company, and they invited the closest scrutiny of the manner in which they had proceeded in the attainment of that object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01205"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> insisted, that the House had a right to ascertain whether or not the company had fulfilled its part of the contract.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01206"><member>Mr. W. Horton</member><membercontribution> admitted the right, but denied the power, of the House to inspect all the private accounts of the company.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01207"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> called upon government to watch the proceedings of the company with jealousy; although he had no doubt, from the candid statement of the hon. gentleman, that at present there was nothing to be complained of.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01208"><member>Mr. Stanley,</member><membercontribution> injustice to the company, felt bound to state, that during the short time he had been in the Colonial Office, he had found that body ready to enter into the fullest explanations government had a right to demand. He believed that the whole of the terms of the contract had been definitively settled. Some misapprehension might arise out of the expressions used that night: the contract at one time was called a grant, at another a sale, and at a third, a bargain; but whatever it was, he was satisfied that no favour had been shown to the company, but that it had obtained a certain portion of land, that it might be put into a state capable of cultivation. The payments were made by annual instalments, and no title was given to the company until they had fulfilled all the preliminary parts of the engagement: when the money was paid the title was given, and not till then. He did not mean to use the words in an opprobrious sense; but the fact certainly was, that the company was a body of land-jobbers. If the proprietors ever derived any profits from the scheme, it could only be at a very remote period, and they must lay out of their money for many years. In the mean time, heavy expenses must be incurred; and, before it would be taken by settlers, the company must confer on the land a value that could only be given to it by the disbursement of a large capital. As one part of the motion was already satisfied, and another could not be complied with, he wished it to be withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0685"/>
<col>1355</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01209"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that, being one of those who were anxious to promote emigration, he was far from viewing this company with a jealous eye, or from reproaching government with the contracts they had entered into with it. On the contrary, he should like to see similar bargains made with a dozen other companies, on the same terms and with the same objects. This company had purchased a million or two of acres at a certain price, and as this sum was received, it was to be applied to defray the expenses of those colonies, which had been hitherto paid by that House. The company assisted emigrants who found their way across the Atlantic, with the means of removing themselves to the place where they were to be located; and it supplied them, besides, with provisions for a year or a year and a half. Thus the company forwarded emigration in the best possible manner, without calling on the government for any assistance. By its exertions large tracts of soil, which would otherwise remain barren, had been brought under cultivation. He was sure, if other companies could be induced to employ their capital in the same way, they would be amply repaid in six or seven years, and would render great benefit to the public, by finding employment in the colonies for multitudes of people who could find none in their own country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01210"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. gentleman had taken a correct view of the utility of these companies to the country. In other parts of the world there were immense tracts of wild land which were totally unproductive; and if, by any company, they could be brought under cultivation, so as to make a return to the parties employed upon them, the result would be, not only beneficial to the colony, but to the general interests of this country. He was glad that he could state, that companies on the same principle had been formed in New South Wales and at Van Diemen's Land. He trusted they would be all successful; for to the extent in which they reclaimed lands from the state of nature, they contributed essentially to the increase of the power and resources of this country. By the contract with the Colonial Department, the Canada Company had given for what it had purchased the full rate at which land was selling in the market. The company was paying down ready
<col>1356</col>
money, while it had to look to a remote period for the return of the capital so embarked. The hon. member for Bristol had talked as if this company had been turned loose in Canada, to select for itself any favourite spot it might fancy. But what was the fact? The company had first contracted for two millions of acres, consisting of clergy and crown reserves. Some difficulty arose as to the clergy reserves which could not be overcome, and the result was that they did not form part of the contract, and the company received in lieu of them a million of acres, situated on the banks of Lake Huron, lying in one lot together. The company obtained no title to those lands but as they were progressively settled, and the purchase money paid. As the company in succession received the titles, the public would receive an annual sum in aid of the burthen which the colonies brought on this country in maintaining their civil establishments. Government had not been so improvident as to leave out of their view public improvements in these colonies. It had been stipulated, that one third of the money from the company should be expended in building bridges, making roads, and other public purposes of convenience and benefit. A more judicious appropriation of the land could not have been devised. The company had no desire to conceal its proceedings. The best way in which its prosperity could be promoted was by making known all its proceedings, and inviting, rather than shunning, investigation. He knew nothing as to the profits of the company; but he believed the directors did not regard its affairs as likely to excite either jealousy or envy. He trusted that the great mass of papers already before the House would satisfy the hon. alderman, without adding to them these returns; more especially as the hon. alderman had, on the point in question, already obtained explanation. He hoped, therefore, that the hon. alderman would not press his motion, but be contented with applying to the directors; any one of whom could give him the information he required. He agreed with his hon. friend, the member for Preston, that this was a question which claimed the attention of government, involving, as it did, so many interests connected with the permanent welfare and general prosperity of that important part of the king's dominions, and particularly as it concerned the constitu-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0686"/>
<col>1357</col>
tional rights of the inhabitants, under the act of 1791. After the recess it was his intention to call the attention of the House to the whole of this great subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01211">After a short reply, the worthy alderman consented to withdraw his motion.</p>

His object in proposing to leave out these words was, to remove the stigma which now attached to dissection. He had had some correspondence with medical men on the subject, and they were of opinion, that the little assistance they derived from this source did not counterbalance the effects which the stigma of condemning criminals to dissection had in deterring people from giving their bodies for dissection. If this stigma were done away, he thought something would be done to promote the improvement in a branch of knowledge which was essential to the public.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PENRYN DISFRANCHISEMENT BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01220">On the motion of lord John Russell, the order of the day was read for the further consideration of the Report of this bill.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01221"><member>Mr. J. Stewart</member><membercontribution> rose to propose a clause. In the course of the various discussions that had taken place on this bill, the fact of the corruption of the borough of Penryn had been assumed to be so notorious as to admit of no doubt, and for that reason the elective franchise was to be transferred to the town of Manchester. The clause he proposed to introduce would make it imperative on the members returned for Manchester, to subscribe a Declaration before they took their seats, that their return had not been procured by bribery, or by any other corrupt or improper means. This, he thought, was the most conscientious mode of reform that could be adopted, and it would necessarily have the effect of saving Manchester, the adopted child of the noble lord, from falling into the errors and offences which, had proved so fatal to the independence and franchise of Penryn. The clause was to the following effect:&#x2014;"Be it further enacted, that the Burgesses to be elected and returned for the said borough of Manchester shall each, at the table of the House of Commons, and before they take their seats, make and subscribe a Declaration in the following words: I, A. B., do solemnly declare, that I have neither given nor promised to give, nor do intend to give, either by myself, or by any other person for me, directly, or indirectly, any fee, reward, or other gratuity, to any one of the electors of the borough of Manchester, in consideration of his vote, in order to my being returned or elected as a Burgess to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0687"/>
<col>1359</col>
serve in parliament for the said borough; and I believe that my return has not been procured or promoted by any peer of parliament or any person acting on his behalf." He proposed a Declaration instead of an Oath, because he believed it would be found generally more acceptable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01222"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> said, he could have no possible objection to the introduction of this clause, if it were made part of a general measure of reform. He remembered that, many years ago, the hon. member for Cumberland (Mr. Curwen) had a bill before the House, in which there was a clause to nearly the same import. That was a general measure, and it had his support; but he had a decided objection to place the representatives of Manchester on a different footing from other members. Those who thought it likely that the elections for Manchester would be more corrupt than those for other places, knew nothing of the state of that town. If the hon. gentleman would make his Declaration part of a general measure, it should have his hearty assent; but he would give his decided negative to it, if it applied to any particular borough.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01223"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> was surprised at the opposition offered to this proposition by the right hon. baronet, who was so uniformly the advocate of reform. If the hon. member had made this proposition in a bill which would have applied to all the members, though the right hon. baronet might have urged no objection to it, he was sure an abundance of members would have protested against it, as a measure too sweeping and general. It was the fashion to sanction none but partial reforms. The House was to deal with every particular case as it arose; but no principle was to be laid down for general application to delinquent boroughs. How, then, were partial benefits to be gained, but by proceeding on the same principle? It was said that there would be something peculiarly invidious in placing the members for Manchester in a situation in which they would appear more pure than the other members of the House; or turning the argument the other way, in apprehending them to be less pure. But that was not to him a sufficient reason for not taking advantage of the opportunity of recognizing a valuable principle, which, if they found it work well in this instance, would present an example worthy of imitation, and might gradually spread,
<col>1360</col>
until it became co-extensive with the representation of the House. He could not understand why the advocate of a general measure should oppose its partial application; and he trusted, therefore, that the hon. member would press the clause to a division, and try the sincerity of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01224"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> objected to the proposition, because it included no protection to the poor and dependent voters. If it had been founded on the principle of secret voting, which would afford a real protection to the labouring classes, that would, indeed, be an improvement in the system of voting at elections. But this Declaration would be a cloak&#x2014;a mere pretence of purity&#x2014;leaving the great objections to the present system as strong as ever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01225"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he should have been astonished if any hon. member had attempted to introduce into this bill a proposition that votes should be given in secret. He trusted he should never see the day when that principle would be applied to the electors of this country&#x2014;when those electors would be so lowered in character, that they durst not state their objections openly to the candidate, and make known their reasons for voting against him. That, however, was not the proposition which the House had to discuss; but if it were made, he would decidedly oppose the introduction of any principle into a single bill, which, if good, should be made a general measure of legislation. He objected to the proposed Declaration, because it did not seem to him consistent with good sense or sound policy, to confine regulation to any particular borough, which, if right, should be generally established.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01226"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> believed the right hon. gentleman's words did not convey his real meaning. Did voting by ballot lower the character of the members of that House? Was it not deemed a wise and just mode to choose the members of committees by ballot? This had long been the practice of that House, and the right hon. gentleman, therefore, had carried his condemnation of the proposition a little too far. He concurred with his hon. friend, that this Declaration ought to be a general measure; but if the hon. member went to a division, he would vote with him, though he would advise him not to press his proposition on the present bill, but to intro-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0688"/>
<col>1361</col>

<title>SUPPLY OF WATER TO THE METROPOLIS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01229"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution>, seeing the Secretary of State for the Home Department in his place, begged to call his attention to the Correspondence just laid on the table, from the Commission appointed to inquire into the Supply of Water to the Metropolis. He must say, in the outset, that this correspondence was any thing but satisfactory; and there were one or two points in it on which he felt it his duty to ask for some explanation. It appeared that the commissioners imagined that their powers extended, not merely to an inquiry into the present state of the supply of water to the metropolis, but that they were bound to suggest the means of making up the deficiency in the supply, if there was any, and of finding a remedy for the insalubrity of the water, if they found it to be so. Under this impression, they had entered upon a very extended examination, and had collected a large mass of evidence. After stating that they "had been occupied for four months in collecting a large mass of evidence relating to a much more extended inquiry than was comprised in the questions to which the right hon. Secretary had limited their commission," they proceeded to say, "this evidence, we hoped, would have prepared the way for our recommendation of a practicable and efficacious plan of supplying the whole of the metropolis with pure and wholesome water&#x2014;an object which we cannot but esteem as of considerable importance, and which, as it appears from the several petitions to parliament giving occasion to the present commission, has been so loudly and so earnestly called for by the public." The right hon. gentleman objected, that great expense would result from taking levels and making surveys; but if those proceedings had not been originally intended, he would ask why an eminent engineer, Mr. Telford, had been appointed a member of the com-
<col>1362</col>
mission. What service could he render, if the labours of the commission were to be confined merely to an analysis of the water in its present state? The notion under which the commissioners had directed their labours was, that they were bound to suggest some mode of ensuring a salubrious and abundant supply of water to the whole of the metropolis. But in consequence of the opinion given by the Secretary of State, they had found it necessary to limit their inquiry. The right hon. gentleman had told them to make an analysis of the water; and they, in reply, had required him to wait six weeks longer before it could be made. As the evidence was already prepared, he thought it desirable to have it submitted to the House, without waiting for the analysis, the delay of which would make it impossible for any legislative measure to pass this session. In his opinion, it was not intended that the commission should be limited to a mere analysis of the water. Why, he would again ask, was Mr. Telford included in the commission, if some engineering survey was not intended? He understood, that, without taking a level, Mr. Telford could suggest such a scheme as would meet the wishes of government and parliament, and satisfy the objects of the commissioners. At any rate, he trusted the right hon. gentleman would order the evidence already prepared to be presented to the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01230"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that when he returned to office, he found that a commission had been appointed by a former Secretary of State, enabling certain persons named in it to institute a full inquiry into the state of the supply of water in the metropolis. He found that the three eminent persons named in the commission had power to administer oaths to the witnesses who gave evidence before them; and it certainly did appear that in other respects they were furnished with ample powers to conduct their inquiry. As to taking levels and making surveys, he had required an estimate of the expense before he would give his consent, but that had not been furnished him; and he could not agree to embark in any scheme without some limits being assigned to the expense that might be incurred by the country. The correspondence proved, that the commissioners had full powers to conduct their inquiry. He had not told them that they had nothing to do but to make an analysis of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0689"/>
<col>1363</col>
water; but surely, when it was considered that this commission bore date the 5th June, 1827, it was surprising that no analysis had been made, with a view to ascertain the salubrity of the water. He did not think that that alone was all that was necessary; but he did think that no report could be complete without it. If the report of the commissioners should show that the present companies, who derived their supply from the Thames, could not from that source give a sufficient and salubrious supply, he trusted that new companies would be formed for the better accommodation of the public. But the expense of the surveys should fall on those new companies, and not on the public; unless government intended to undertake the supply of water themselves. If they left it to private enterprise, the expense of employing engineers should belong to the parties engaging in the speculation. He repeated, that he could sanction no plans of that kind, without a distinct estimate of the expense. The letter he had written to the commissioners, stating his views of their powers, had been, by his direction, laid before the right hon. gentleman (Mr. S. Bourne) who had issued the commission, and he had entirely concurred in the whole of it. He had no objection to present the evidence already taken before the commissioners, but before he determined to employ engineers he would repeat&#x2014;"Let us have the report on what they are competent to decide; namely, the salubrity of the water."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01231"><member>Mr. S. Rice</member><membercontribution> said, that the delay which had occurred in the prosecution of the objects of the commission arose, as he believed, from the following causes:&#x2014;At the time when the commission was appointed, they nominated a person as secretary, whom they afterwards found to be incompetent to the performance of its duties. The principal objection was, that this person was not versed in the science of engineering; and they applied to the noble lord, then at the head of the Home Department, to order the appointment of a practical engineer. Lord Lansdowne expressed some doubt as to the power which he possessed to interfere in the selection of such a person; but he informed the commission, that if they felt themselves embarrassed in their proceedings by the want of an engineer, and were disposed to make a selection of any gentleman acquainted with the science of engineering, he would
<col>1364</col>
sanction the appointment. His lordship added, that he did not understand the commission was appointed to examine into the propriety of any new works; but if they were decidedly of opinion that such new works were necessary, and were disposed to send in a statement of what they conceived those works ought to be, and an estimate of their probable expense, he would submit them to the consideration of the Treasury. The House would see, that nothing could be more inexpedient or more inconvenient than to have a kind of roving commission going about the country, in order to take plans and make levels under the direction of an engineer. It was in order to avoid this inconvenience that the commission was requested to send in an estimate of the expense; but no such estimate was sent in while the noble lord remained in office, nor did he believe that any estimate had been sent in since his resignation. Much, therefore, of the delay complained of proceeded from the commissioners themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01232"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> again asked whether the right hon. gentleman had any objection to the production of that part of the evidence which had already been taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01233"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he had no objection to the production of the evidence, if the commissioners consented. It might be that they had taken evidence upon only one side of the question in some cases; and if they were to publish that evidence without taking the evidence which might be opposed to it, their conduct would seem to be influenced by partiality. If, however, the commissioners were not opposed to its immediate production, he had no objection whatever.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CORN LAWS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01234"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> said, he rose for the purpose of moving for certain papers, which would tend to show their lordships the operation of the act of the last session, relative to the introduction, for home consumption, of Corn warehoused before the 1st of July, 1827. In performing that task, he would avail himself of the opportunity it afforded him of stating to the House, the nature of the measure to regulate the introduction of foreign corn, which it was the intention of government to propose to parliament, and the principle upon which that measure
<image src="S2V0018P0I0690"/>
<col>1365</col>
was founded. Thir lordships were well aware that there existed a variety of opinions respecting the introduction of foreign Corn; some persons holding that its importation should be regulated by a high duty, while others contended for its free introduction. He had therefore considered it his duty, and his colleagues had considered it their duty also, in the measure which they were about to propose to parliament, to steer their course between the two extremes, and to propose a measure which would conciliate all parties, and be at the same time favourable to the public. Their lordships would recollect that, notwithstanding the difference of opinion which existed on this subject, all parties agreed that there ought to be some measure brought forward to regulate the introduction of foreign wheat; and while some had expressed the opinion that Corn ought to be imported into this country free from duty, and others had thought that a small duty on its introduction ought to be imposed, and if ever there should be a fixed duty, in his opinion it ought to be a small one,&#x2014;all had agreed that some protection should be afforded to the agriculturist of this country. The opinion of those who contended for a small duty was founded upon the great burthen of taxation in this country, the particular burthens on land, and the superior mode of tillage. The opinion of those who were in favour of a low duty went to establish a system under which the poorer lands of this country, which had been brought into cultivation by the application of labour and capital, would be thrown entirely out of cultivation, and even the richer lands would be affected. This country, he would maintain, had been brought into the state of cultivation in which it now was, by the protection which had been invariably afforded to agriculture by parliament, and which had induced gentlemen to lay out their capital upon the cultivation of waste lands. The effect of the proposition of those who were for a low duty would be to throw the poorer lands out of cultivation and turn them into waste, to reduce the cultivation of the richer lands, thus diminishing the productive powers of the country, and filially to throw this country for support and subsistence on foreign countries. Besides these circumstances, he begged their lordships to consider the consequences which must result if the powers from whose dominions those resources were generally drawn were to
<col>1366</col>
lay a heavy tax on the exportation of Com or upon its transit. He entreated their lordships to consider what must be the consequences of such an act on the part of those powers: for the performing of which they might be fully justified. But supposing such moderation on their part, as to allow this country to continue to draw supplies from their dominions, he entreated their lordships to observe that this country would find itself, under that system, at all times in the same state in which it found itself in years of famine, and would be exposed to the largest prices of Corn; for though the cost of production in Poland would not be increased, yet prices would be regulated here, not by the prices in that country, but by the profits which were to be derived by all those who were concerned in the importation of the corn. Under those circumstances, a reduction of duty would not be productive of a reduction in price, considering the state of agriculture, but would, on the contrary, produce an enormous increase of price. He begged their lordships to look to Ireland, and to consider what must be the consequences of the want of encouragement to agriculture, when applied to that country, a country which last year supplied England with two million quarters of grain; the quantity of wheat imported being no less than four hundred thousand quarters. He begged their lordships to consider what must be the consequences of cutting off from that country the only source of industry&#x2014;the only manufacture, with one exception which remained to her. He was sure that no man who felt for that country would think it prudent to make, such a sacrifice, in order to introduce corn into this country at a cheaper rate. But he spoke not only with reference to Ireland, but also to this country. He was ready to state that the gentlemen of this country had, by the expense of their capital, and the labour which they had employed on their estates, raised the agriculture of the country to its present prosperous condition; and nothing could be more unjust than to take from them that protection by which they had been enabled to bring cultivation to the state in which it now was, and to deprive them of those profits which were so justly their due, on account of the capital laid out by them. He would say that the merchant, the manufacturer, the poor, and the whole public, were interested in the maintenance
<image src="S2V0018P0I0691"/>
<col>1367</col>
of the independent affluence of the nobility and gentry of this country; that the government were interested in supporting their influence on account of the assistance which had always been derived from them in every branch of internal government, and on account of the support which they had afforded to government under every circumstance. If it were in his power to make corn cheaper by lessening the protection which the landed gentry had always received, he would not do it, but would leave this country under an expense which it was for its interest to suffer, considering the condition of Ireland.&#x2014; Having expressed his opinion upon the system of importation at a low duty, he would now make a few remarks with respect to the other system&#x2014;that of entire prohibition, which had been greatly complained of. The truth was, that such a system could not be carried strictly into execution, without exposing the country to the greatest evils&#x2014;first of all from want, next from high prices, and also from a superabundance of corn, arising from the introduction of a greater quanity of wheat than was required, at a period when the scarcity had been relieved by an abundant harvest; and lastly, from the depression of prices, affecting not only the produce s of corn in this country, but also the importers of foreign grain. Those evils could be relieved only by the illegal interference of the government, or by ministers coming down to induce parliament to consent to the suspension of the law. There was not a doubt that the system of prohibition had produced all the evils to which he had alluded.&#x2014;He understood that a noble lord had stated, that there were resources in the act of the year 1822, which allowed the diminishing of prices for paying duties; but the country could no more bear the price of 70<i>s</i>. as a prohibition, than that of 80<i>s</i>.; and the noble lord greatly deceived himself if he supposed that a duty of 17<i>s</i>., for three months, and of 12<i>s</i>. ever after, could be borne, when the price of wheat rose to 70<i>s</i>. Under those circumstances, we were driven from the consideration of a prohibition and a fixed duty, unless a small one had all the objections of a prohibition. Government had, therefore, gone to the consideration of a measure adopted on the principle of the bill introduced to their lordships' House last year&#x2014;that of the duty rising as prices fell, and falling as
<col>1368</col>
prices rose, allowing thereby, in proportion as the price of corn in this country was best calculated to bear it, foreign corn to come in by degrees, under certain duties. He wished their lordships to recollect, that after the bill had come under their consideration last year, and was abandoned by the noble lord who had introduced it, an act was passed to enable the holders of corn which had been bonded previous to the 1st of July, 1827, to introduce that corn into the home-market for consumption, after the passing of the act, upon payment of the duty proposed by the bill which had been allowed to drop. From the papers which it was his intention to move for, he would show their lordships the result of the operation of that act. When the bill was brought under their lordships' consideration he had supported it, and he recollected stating his opinion, that that would be an experiment of the measure which had been discussed during the session. He admitted, however, that the experiment had not been a perfectly fair one; for the truth was, that by one of the clauses of that act, those who had corn in bond were obliged to take it out between the months of July and May. They were therefore induced to take out more than they otherwise would have been disposed to do, had they been left entirely to their own discretion. He entreated their lordships to bear this fact in remembrance. The corn in bond on the 1st of July, 1827, amounted to six hundred and thirty-three thousand nine hundred and five quarters; of which five hundred and thirty-one thousand five hundred and seventy-five quarters had been taken out of bond, and one hundred and nineteen thousand four hundred and thirty-four quarters were the amount in bond on the 15th of February last. Under these circumstances, the act had proved ineffectual; because it had brought the corn out of bond, when he believed the price in this country was not such as to render the introduction of corn necessary; he therefore asserted that the measure had in that respect been ineffectual; and it had also been ineffectual in another point. Of that corn which had thus come out of bond, three hundred and eighty thousand quarters were taken out at a duty corresponding to the price of 50<i>s</i>. under the old bill, and ninety-five thousand quarters came out when the price was at a rate lower than that at
<image src="S2V0018P0I0692"/>
<col>1369</col>
which it was intended so large a quantity should be admissible. At the same time he begged their lordships to recollect, that the corn had been forced out of bond by the clause to which he had alluded, which obliged the holders of corn to take it out previously to the 1st of May; and he also begged of them to recollect, that the act had also been ineffectual in this respect, inasmuch as there still was retained in bond one hundred and nineteen thousand quarters, being about one fifth of the whole quantity. In the measure which it was now the intention of government to propose to parliament, the duty, when corn was at 50<i>s</i>. the quarter, would be 34<i>s</i>.; and from 34<i>s</i>. it would go on decreasing 1<i>s.,</i> according as the price of corn increased 1<i>s.</i> until corn rose to 64<i>s</i>. At that price the duty would be 20<i>s</i>.; at 65<i>s</i>. per quarter, 18<i>s</i>.; at 66<i>s</i>. per quarter, 16<i>s</i>.; and at 56<i>s</i>. per quarter, the duty would be the same under this bill as under the last. The difference of the duties under the present system, compared with the bill of last year, would be this:&#x2014;With corn at 50<i>s</i>. the quarter, the duty would be 34<i>s</i>., being a decrease of 6<i>s</i>.; at 55<i>s</i>. there would be a decrease of Is. of duty. He had already said that at 56<i>s</i>. the duty was the same as under the last bill. At 57<i>s</i>. there would be an increase of 1<i>s</i>.; at 58<i>s</i>. there was an increase of 2<i>s</i>.; at 60<i>s</i>. there would be an increase of 4<i>s</i>.; at 61<i>s</i>. an increase of 5<i>s</i>.; at 62<i>s</i>. an increase of 6<i>s</i>.; at 63<i>s</i>. an increase of 7<i>s</i>.; and at 64<i>s</i>. an increase of 8<i>s</i>.; at 65<i>s</i>., and 66<i>s</i>. also, an increase of 8<i>s</i>.; at 67<i>s</i>. an increase of 7<i>s</i>.; and at 68<i>s</i>. an increase of 6<i>s</i>. With respect to oats and barley, it was proposed that they should remain in the state in which they were placed by the law last passed.&#x2014; There remained now only another point to which he wished to draw their lordships' attention. Their lordships would remember that, during the discussion of the bill of last year, he had moved an amendment, the object of which was to prevent frauds in the system of averages from being carried into execution by means of the warehousing system. Since last year a great deal had been done to remedy those frauds. In the first place, the Irish and Scotch corn in the market had been included in the averages; and returns from a great number of places, not before included, were added. The difficulty of fraud would be increased in proportion to
<col>1370</col>
the quantity on which the average was struck. Besides this, the additional duty laid on the article itself would render the gain by any fraud, from the price varying between 1<i>s</i>. and 2<i>s</i>. only, so small, that it would scarcely be worthy any person's while to attempt imposition. Their lordships would recollect, that in discussing this question last year, he had stated that it was his wish to introduce some regulations which might put an end to all such frauds. He was, however, aware that it was difficult to frame regulations strictly applicable to the trade in corn. The objection to them was founded on the injury which the trade might experience from any regulations. Under these circumstances, and considering the duty now proposed, to be such as would be admitted by every one as sufficient to give a full and fair protection to the agriculture of the country, he trusted their lordships would be satisfied without any interference with the bonding system.&#x2014;Having now mentioned every thing he wished to state, he earnestly entreated their lordships to consider what he had just proposed, before they entered into any discussion. He had only to move for an account of the average price of wheat from the 1st of July last to the latest period; and also for a return of the quantity of foreign wheat entered for home consumption during the same period, and the rate of duty paid thereon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01235"><member>The Earl of Falmouth</member><membercontribution> said, he had entertained a sincere hope that what the noble duke had to bring forward would have been so entirely satisfactory to parliament and the country, as to give occasion for no observations whatever. He confessed, however, that though the outset of the noble duke's speech had afforded him the hope that those expectations would be realized, he had been disappointed with what had followed; and though he could assure the noble duke that he thought every thing which emanated from him entitled to the utmost consideration, he could not but make known his disappointment. Circumstances had changed since a bill of a nature similar to the one now proposed was discussed last session. Their lordships were aware that circumstances had changed most favourably, notwithstanding the arguments which had been urged in favour of that bill, and the evils pointed out as likely to arise from a moderate harvest. Those anticipations
<image src="S2V0018P0I0693"/>
<col>1371</col>
had been completely falsified by the result; but a quantity of wheat, amounting to more than five hundred thousand quarters, had been entered for home consumption, which had thrown down the price of the averages to a rate at which it was impossible that wheat could generally be cultivated in this country. If he understood the noble duke rightly, it was intended to give to the farmer a boon of only 4<i>s</i>.; but he did not think 4<i>s</i>. sufficient. It might perhaps seem that, being a landholder, he was unreasonable; but he begged to call their lordships' attention to the state of the country. One broad fact stared them constantly in the face; namely, that without agricultural prosperity it was impossible there could be general prosperity in this country. Every tradesman in a country town was aware that the farmer was his best customer. Much had been said about superabundance of population, and of the increase of crime, particularly of the crime of poaching. There might be a complication of causes, which tended to increase the evil, but the principal cause was, because the farmer could not at the present prices, employ the superabundant population. Those prices were calculated on the nice economy of parliament&#x2014;prices at which the farmer could just put his wheat into the ground, in those parts of the country not peculiarly favourable, on account of the soil or other circumstances. The farmer was called upon to exert himself against the evil of superabundant population, at the same time that the sources from which his industry and exertions were to spring were dried up. He thought that, placed as they were, it would be better to wait a year or two under the operation of the existing Corn-laws, than to adopt any crude or incomplete measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01236"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> said, he could not allow that opportunity to pass, without expressing an opinion upon the present proposition. He had heard it rumoured a day or two ago, that the pivot price would be raised 2<i>s</i>.; but now out came the reality, that the addition, instead of being 2<i>s</i>., was actually 4<i>s</i>.; and at certain points and turns of the market, it was to make no less a difference than 8<i>s</i>. between the scale of prices in the new bill and that of last year. To such a system of legislation he might content himself to reply in a single observation, couched in three or four well-known words, and these were&#x2014; "this is too bad." If in fair weather
<col>1372</col>
they were to attempt to maintain these prices, when the seasons went beyond the average, what were the people to expect when a reverse took place? He begged, on this first movement of the government upon the Corn-laws, to assure the noble duke, that if he meant this to be a permanent bill, he was never more mistaken in his life, than in endeavouring to effect such an arrangement as this. Last year's bill was bad enough for the country; but this was "too bad" indeed. It was intolerable to expect that such a plan to increase the market price could be maintained: it was quite chimerical, The noble duke had said, let them look to Ireland. And well they might, for Ireland alone had the merit of preventing the consummation of the original design of these Corn-bill framers; namely, their keeping up the prices at 80<i>s</i>. To Ireland this country was indebted for the prices being lowered to 50<i>s</i>. or 60<i>s</i>. Those who concocted the bill in 1815, and their 80<i>s</i>. price, did not contemplate the effect which the importations from Ireland would produce upon the market. It was Ireland, then, that had enabled the British population to subsist, in spite of these 80<i>s</i>. speculators. Bad as last year's bill was, and worse as the present looked, there were, it seemed, individuals who were yet unsatisfied with what they called adequate protection. He wished such people joy of their feelings: a more unreasonable class of expectants had never been left to brood over their chagrin. He was sorry that he neither could agree in the principle of the noble duke's resolutions, nor in the general doctrine which he had propounded in introducing them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01237"><member>Lord Goderich</member><membercontribution> said, that though this was not the proper time to discuss the proposed bill, he wished to express his anxious desire that this question should be brought, if possible, to a satisfactory termination in the course of the present session. It was high time that the country should know how it was really to stand respecting these laws; for he could not imagine a greater evil than the continuance of the present incomplete plan for two or three years longer. He assured the noble duke, that he felt the greatest anxiety to look with a favourable eye upon any approximation to a fair settlement of this question. If his noble friend had, however, through any views of policy or consistency, introduced his clause of last
<image src="S2V0018P0I0694"/>
<col>1373</col>
year, he should have been obliged to object to at least that part of his proposition. But, as his noble friend did not intend to propose that clause, the question was reduced to a matter of degree, upon which he hoped they would come to a fair understanding. As far as he was himself concerned, he was prepared to sacrifice much of his individual opinion, to produce a general conciliatory arrangement. He would not pretend to say that there were not details in the proposition before their lordships which went beyond his view of what was necessary; but as far as regarded the addition of the 4<i>s</i>., he was not adverse to it. He would repeat, for God's sake let the question be now settled, and he hoped that in the consideration of this formidable subject, they would exclude from their minds all individual and party feelings, for the better attainment of a satisfactory conclusion to the business.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01238"><member>Lord Redesdale</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that the country did not stand in need of a law, the effect of which must be to lessen the amount of agricultural produce, and consequently still further to diminish the employment at present afforded to agricultural labourers. The importation of one million quarters of foreign corn must, it was calculated, reduce the market-price in this country 2<i>s</i>. a quarter, and it had been further conjectured, that the opening; of our ports to that commodity would take no less than seven millions out of the pockets of the agriculturists, and consequently diminish in an equal degree the employment of labour. If this was the case, the farmer, instead of receiving the reward of his own labour, would be incapable of availing himself of the labours of others; and the consequence would be a degree of distress of which it was impossible to form an adequate idea. He much wished noble lords would turn their attention to the real amount of the labour called into activity by the agriculture of the country. He alluded not merely to the number of persons more immediately employed in the management of land, but to that numerous class of persons whose occupation it was, to produce the various necessaries consumed by individuals engaged in agriculture. The number of our population so engaged would be found to be infinitely greater than all those who derived their subsistence from the manufacture of articles intended for foreign markets. That was a most im-
<col>1374</col>
portant consideration.&#x2014;Another point deserving attention was this:&#x2014;Supposing our ports to be open to the importation of foreign grain, and two or three consecutive bad seasons to occur, the unavoidable result must be, that instead of cheap, we should produce dear corn. This was the necessary consequence of depending for our supply upon foreign soils. The only means in our power of having cheap corn was to have a large production of that commodity at home. An error into which the opponents of restrictions in the corn trade were liable to fall, was this:&#x2014;they considered the production of corn as constituting the whole of agriculture; forgetting altogether the important article of wool. Now this was absurd; for if a question was to be examined, it ought to be investigated in all its bearings and relations. We went on importing foreign wool to an extent almost incredible, while we had lying in our warehouses immense quantities of our own growth. The direct consequence of this was, to lessen the number of sheep in this country, and to impair agriculture to an equal extent. If the noble duke were to propose a duty on manure, their lordships would think it a very extraordinary tax; but the importation of foreign wool, as at present permitted, diminished our breed of sheep, and was neither more nor less than imposing a duty on that manure which was necessary for the production of corn. There was another consideration deserving of attention: if by permitting the importation of wool the legislature reduced the profits of agriculture in the article of wool, they necessarily increased the price of meat; for if the farmer could not obtain a profit on his wool, he would be obliged to raise the price of meat, in order to secure a profit somewhere. He should like to know the amount of population employed in agricultural pursuits, and the number not directly so engaged, but whose employment arose out of the profits of agriculture, and the necessity that existed for supplying the wants of agriculturists through their agency. If such information was afforded, their lordships would find that the trade, commerce, and manufactures of the country were, in comparison, of little consequence. The effect of the measure proposed by the noble duke would be this&#x2014;that, if it allowed a fair price to the farmer in good seasons, it would utterly ruin him in bad ones; for,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0695"/>

when the agriculturists had only half instead of a whole crop, the consequence would be that, by the importation of foreign corn, the farmer, instead of gaining a profit, must inevitably be ruined. The system on which the Corn-laws were founded was this: we contemplated the importation of foreign corn only when it was found that, unless we resorted to that course, greater inconveniences would ensue. Importation was, in fact, intended to prevent scarcity. What were the results of a perseverance in that system? Improvement in agriculture; and, instead of an increase, a diminution in the price of corn, amounting, in late years, to nearly one half. If their lordships looked impartially at the subject, they must perceive that the only way to have cheap corn was by raising the condition of agriculture; and that the only way to have corn permanently cheap was to produce it ourselves. Of one thing he was assured&#x2014;that if the duty on the importation of foreign grain was to undergo any modification, it ought not to be rapidly or suddenly diminished. If any other course was adopted, it would be impossible to prevent the dangers and losses consequent to the agriculturists upon a succession of bad seasons. When a bad season occurred, and the farmer obtained not more than half a crop from his ground, he could not be expected to sell for the same price as was practicable under more favourable circumstances. He could not too frequently press upon their lordships' attention the importance of inquiring into the amount of population employed in the cultivation of land, and in supplying necessaries of various kinds to persons so employed. It was not of so much importance to what price corn might chance to rise in this country, so long as it contained sufficient for the food of its population, for every thing else bore about an equal proportion to the price of corn, and was regulated accordingly. The effect of the high prices of corn was, to encourage increased agriculture to such an extent, that we had now succeeded in bringing the quantity of grain produced in this kingdom much nearer to the proportion of our population than formerly; consequently all the great interests of the state were in a more secure position. That position he should be exceedingly sorry to disturb or endanger by the adoption of measures so different in character from those under which the country had

hitherto prospered, and attained its present pitch of greatness.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MAUY-LE-BONE SELECT VESTRY<lb/> BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01240"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, he had been intrusted with a Petition from about five thousand most respectable inhabitants of St. Mary-le-bone, in favour of the bill before the House, for opening the Select Vestry of that Parish. It complained, that that body was self-elected; that funds were raised under its authority by rates of different kinds, to the amount of about 200,000<i>l</i>. a-year, and that, within a comparatively few years, the poor-rates had been augmented between 50 and 60 per cent. It prayed that the accounts of the Select Vestry might be open to inspection; and set forth that, besides the annual rates, the parish, under the superintendence of the Select Vestry, had incurred a debt of 230,000<i>l</i>. The evil was in the system of Select Vestries generally, and it was certainly a most disgusting and absurd principle, that a whole parish should be taxed by those in whose election they had had no voice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01241"><member>Mr. Astell</member><membercontribution> hoped, that the House would suspend its judgment, until both sides had been heard. The affairs of the parish of Mary-le-bone were managed in a way to give general satisfaction; and for fifty or sixty years, the Select Vestry had enjoyed the confidence of the inhabitants, until certain persons assumed the existence of abuses they could not establish. With regard to the bill before the House, the Select Vestry had at first intended to introduce a measure, but abandoning that design, it was taken up by certain inhabitants, who put up notices accordingly, which had been held sufficiently to comply with the Standing Orders of the House. The forms of the House had not, however, been satisfied in the Committee on the bill; since the order of reference required the attendance upon it of four members besides the Chairman; yet the only person present on that occasion, was an hon. alderman opposite (Wood). One member of the Committee had been absent from London during the whole time. The second reading also had been got over in a very extraordinary manner; for, although
<image src="S2V0018P0I0696"/>
<col>1377</col>
it was known that the measure would be opposed, it was hurried through that stage before four o'clock. There was, in fact, no ground of complaint against the Select Vestry of Mary-le-bone, and as to the increase of the poor-rates, such had been the case all over the metropolis. The population of this principality rather than parish, was not less than one hundred and twenty thousand, and the rates were upwards of 100,000<i>l</i>. The outcry was, that while other rates were diminishing, the poor-rates were increased; but, on the whole, no parish was so well off. Its affairs were managed by one hundred and twenty three vestrymen, at the head of whom was the duke of Portland, and at the bottom of the list the humble tradesman. He (Mr. Astell) had only belonged to this body for a short time; but he knew that the vestry-men paid daily and hourly attention to their duties, and that their services were most beneficial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01242"><member>Mr. Hobhouse</member><membercontribution> said, he had presented the original petition for the bill, and he had the high authority of the Speaker for saying, that there was nothing informal or irregular in the proceeding. When the hon. gentleman said, that no complaint could be made against the Select Vestry, he seemed to have forgotten the very petition before the House, by which it appeared that five thousand inhabitants thought they had serious ground of charge. He knew also perfectly well, that the whole parish was in a state of ferment and discontent, from the conviction that a total change was necessary in the management of its affairs. But even if its affairs were well managed, that was no reason why rates should be imposed by men who were not in any way responsible: it was enough if it were alleged, that the parishioners were refused the opportunity of looking into the accounts. He hoped the subject would be thoroughly investigated. Let both parties have a fair trial, and he had no doubt the result would be a change in the management of the affairs of the parish.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01243"><member>Colonel Baillie</member><membercontribution> contended, that there was no pretence for the charges contained in the petition of the inhabitants. The number present at the meeting where the petition of the Vestry had been agreed to, was, he believed eighty, and it was signed by all who were not members of parliament. Into the merits of the case he should be happy to commence a full
<col>1378</col>
and fair examination, being satisfied that the result would be a decision, that the grievances were entirely imaginary. The increase in the poor-rates was not attributable to mal-administration, but to the influx of Irish paupers into the parish, who had been clothed and fed by the Vestry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01244"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that nine out of ten of the parishioners were dissatisfied with the present state of things in the parish. Even the Select Vestry was not unanimous against the bill, several being in favour of opening the Vestry, and the inspection of the accounts by the parishioners at large. He had no hesitation, in stating, that all the allegations in the petition would be established, in evidence before the committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01245"><member>Mr. Alderman Wood</member><membercontribution> justified his conduct as chairman of the committee, and complained of the manner in which an hon. gentleman, one of the Select Vestry, had gone about canvassing members for their votes, previous to the second reading of the bill, contending that such conduct was unbecoming and indecent. He had not moved the second reading in any haste, nor until he was called upon by others to proceed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01246"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> supported the petition on the principle, that no man had a right to tax another without granting an inspection of the accounts, to show that the tax was justly imposed. He had had some experience on this subject, having himself sustained the expense of a proceeding against a select vestry, by whom houses were most unequally rated. The fact was, that the whole business of the parish was managed by a junto.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01247"><member>Mr. Dawson</member><membercontribution> observed, that the question of select vestries was one which ought at all times to attract much interest. It was often impossible to control their expenses: parishes, in many cases, being entirely at the mercy of a few individuals. Whether in the metropolis, select vestries did more harm than good, he was not prepared to say, but in no case ought the vacancies to be supplied by the remaining members; and a control over the expenditure ought to be exercised by the parish at large. The existing regulations pressed most severely upon all classes, but especially upon shopkeepers: and an alteration in the system of paving and lighting seemed absolutely necessary, as thousands at present were taxed without limitation or inquiry,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0697"/>
<col>1379</col>
He was satisfied that the result of the investigation would be, that some restriction should be placed on the enormous power now exercised by the Vestry. In his view, the prayer of the petition was proper and reasonable.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CORN LAWS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01249">The order of the day for the House resolving itself into a committee on the Corn-laws was read. The Speaker having left the chair,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01250"><member>Mr. C. Grant</member><membercontribution> said, that in rising to move certain resolutions upon the Corn-laws, he felt it incumbent upon him, first, to return his thanks to the House for the kind indulgence which they had shown towards him upon a late occasion, when he had been prevented, by indisposition, from calling their attention to these resolutions; and next, to solicit the indulgence of the House upon the present occasion, while he was treating upon a subject of such great importance, a subject affecting all interests and classes of the community, surrounded by so many theories, partly just and partly ill-founded,&#x2014;surrounded, too, by errors so dangerous, and by opinions so conflicting, that it was a task of no inconsiderable difficulty to point out any good practical measure which, while it removed as much as possible the objections to the present system, would be likely to meet with the concurrence of all parties. If he were, called upon to develop the great principles which this question involved, and to detail the maxims upon which the trade in corn ought to be conducted, he should stand in still greater need of the indulgence of the House; but, fortunately for himself, and fortunately for the patience of the House, he had not so difficult a task to perform. He could not forget that, a few months ago, the House had given the fullest consideration to this subject,&#x2014;that it had been deliberately discussed by them,&#x2014;and that in the course of those discussions, the House had formed their opinion upon almost every measure upon the subject of the Corn-laws. He was bound, therefore, to assume, until the contrary was told him, that the House were prepared to concede the principle which had been acted upon last session; namely, that the corn-trade ought no longer to be regulated by an exclusive code of laws&#x2014;that it ought no longer to be subject to prohibitions, but to a system of duties. Whether those duties should be fixed or variable,
<col>1380</col>
and if fixed, at what rate, Or if varying, how the fluctuations should be regulated, were points altogether of minor consideration, he took his stand upon this great, and, as he believed, recognized principle, that agriculture was to be protected by duties, and not by prohibition.&#x2014;In the course of last session, an hon. member (Mr. Western) brought forward a series of resolutions, the object of which was to modify the act of 1822, and which were effectually resisted. At the close of the last session, Mr. Canning announced his intention of introducing a bill on the same principle as the bill which had been abandoned, but with certain modifications. What the precise nature of those modifications was, it was impossible for him to say, but it was probable that they would have given greater protection to agriculture. He thought that such must have been the nature of the modifications, because he thought that Mr. Canning, as a practical statesman, would have been obliged to look for a practical result, an arbitration between conflicting opinions, and that therefore he would have introduced a measure which would have been agreed to by all parties. In conformity, therefore, with the authority of Mr. Canning, he called upon the House to adopt the principle he had mentioned, but with such modifications as should appear necessary.&#x2014;In this state the question now descended to the House. They were called upon to agree to a bill founded on the same principle, but with such modifications as should appear necessary, from all the information and experience which had resulted since the lamented death of Mr. Canning. They found the corn trade regulated by the same acts, they found that the object for which those acts were framed had not been attained, they found the country harassed every year by discussions on this vexatious subject. Some temporary laws had been passed at various periods. One allowed the admission of five hundred thousand quarters of foreign corn at particular duties; another allowed the admission of four hundred thousand quarters; another made exceptions in favour of Canadian corn. The result of all this temporary legislation was, that the great interests of the country were in a perpetual state of agitation; the contracts for corn and the engagements between landlord and tenant having been continually fluctuating. The country called loudly
<image src="S2V0018P0I0698"/>
<col>1381</col>
upon the House to put an end to this agitation and suspense, and it was the duty of the House to obey this call. He thought it the duty of the House to say, that the acts of 1815 and 1822 should remain in force, or to introduce some measure which would be likely to produce a good result, and not end, as that of the last session ended, in disappointment and abortion. If illness would have been a just excuse for his delaying to bring these resolutions before the consideration of the House, he should have been justified in not presenting himself to their notice that evening; but his anxiety to bring forward some measure on this important subject, and his reliance on the indulgence of the House, had prevented his again absenting himself. He thought that if Mr. Canning, at the close of the last session, was impressed with the necessity of making some modifications in his bill, that impression would have been confirmed, if Mr. Canning had lived to witness what had passed since that period.&#x2014; It would be in the recollection of the House, that a partial bill was passed last session&#x2014;a bill which was to operate from the 1st of July, 1827, until the 1st of May in the present year&#x2014; under the same provisions as were contained in the bill which had been abandoned. It was predicted by those who opposed that bill, that its effect would be to depress the price of British, and to introduce foreign, corn into the market. He for one, put as little faith in those predictions now as lie did then. He thought that the depression in the price of British corn was to be accounted for by other circumstances, and that the introduction of foreign corn into the market was to be explained in another way. At the same time, however, these two facts must not be lost sight of. If it was just to take into consideration the alarms of those who were most nearly concerned, in whatever degree they were to be taken into consideration, in the same degree the necessity of taking them into consideration was strengthened by these two facts. Though, as he had before stated, these two facts were to be accounted for in a different manner than by the operation of the act of last session, yet it could not be doubted, that they had excited very strong feelings in the minds of those who had been accustomed to indulge in the predictions to which he had before alluded. They ought apt to leave out of consideration the fact,
<col>1382</col>
that under a duty of 1<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., and a duty of 1<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., five hundred thousand quarters of foreign corn had, in the months of July and August last, been admitted into the market, and that, too, when the price of British corn showed that no foreign supply was necessary. And what use did he make of this fact? Why, he was very well aware that it would be in vain for him to attempt to convince by argument those who were interested, that it was not owing to the law; but he could convince them that the fact was not forgotten, and that the House meant to take it into consideration. The House would recollect that Mr. Canning did not live long enough to become acquainted with this fact. He could assure the House, that he still retained those opinions on this subject which he had expressed last year; and that even now, when it was not possible to carry into effect the strict principles which he held to be correct, he thought it proper to avow them as the standard by which he was guided, and to which it was his wish to approximate. It would, no doubt, be very delightful to carry those strict principles into effect; but it was equally impossible iii morals and in politics to put into practice the strictest principles, because, though the propriety and correctness of them might be manifest, all persons could not be brought to concur on them. He had mentioned those principles, and if this were the proper time, he should not hesitate to enter into a statement of them. He had stated them last year, and had not now departed from them. He did not by any means imagine that the bill of last year mounted up to the demands; he had looked upon it merely as a step towards those demands, and as a measure which, though it did not do enough, did all that could then be done. It was under these circumstances, therefore that they were called upon to deal with the subject,&#x2014;to look for a practical result,&#x2014;to establish a sounder principle in legislating on this question, than had hitherto been carried into effect. His desire was, first to repeal the acts of 1815 and 1822, which, he contended, had cherished much error, and established a mode of legislation separate and distinct from that on any other subject of legislation; and secondly, to establish a sounder principle of legislation. If a sound principle were once established, the House would have made a great step. In his view of the subject, that principle
<image src="S2V0018P0I0699"/>
<col>1383</col>
once sanctioned, the minor considerations which the question involved would be easily disposed of. Of so much importance did he think it to obtain the sanction of parliament to this principle, that he was very sorry that the bill which was sent from that House last session had not descended to them again; because then they would have made a step which now they had yet to make. As with that bill, so it had been with the Catholic bill, which had been totally lost, because one clause of it was objected to; and he believed that the friends of that measure had never ceased to regret the abandonment of it. It was with this view of the subject that he regretted the abandonment of the Corn-bill of last session&#x2014;not because he liked it better in its altered form, but because, even with the alteration, he liked it better than the acts now in force.&#x2014;He now came to the Resolutions which he had to submit to the committee.&#x2014;The first object of these resolutions was to give, in conformity with what he presumed to have been the intention of Mr. Canning, an additional protection to agriculture&#x2014; additional in comparison with the bill which had been lost last session. There were two modes in which this additional protection might be secured: the first was by an augmentation in the scale of duties; the second, by collateral regulation, which would tend to the same end. With respect to augmenting the scale of duties, it was proposed that wheat, the most important article which would come under these resolutions, should be subject to a duty of 32<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. whenever the price of British wheat was at 54<i>s</i>.; and it was also proposed that the duty should be decreased by 1<i>s</i>. for every increase of 1<i>s</i>. in the price of British wheat: so that at 56<i>s</i>. the duty would be 30<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. This scale advanced by diminutions of 1<i>s</i>. in the duty for every increase of 1<i>s</i>. in the price, until the price reached 67<i>s</i>.; then by a diminution of 2<i>s</i>., until the price reached 69<i>s</i>.; by a diminution of 3<i>s</i>., until the price reached 71<i>s</i>.; and by a diminution of 4<i>s</i>., until the price reached 73<i>s</i>. It would be seen, therefore, that at 59<i>s</i>. and 73<i>s</i>., the scales of the two bills coincided; but as they proceeded by different means, the difference between them at the intervals was considerable. He would now read to the committee the scale as it was proposed in the resolutions:&#x2014;

So much with regard to the imperial measure. As to the Winchester measure, it was proposed to impose a duty of 30<i>s</i>. whenever the price in this country was at 54<i>s</i>.; and that the duty should decrease in the same manner as in the scale for the imperial measure.&#x2014;With respect to other grain, applications had been made for an augmentation of the duty on barley and oats, but especially on oats. After considering the subject, however, he had thought it would be better to make no alteration in these duties. He had said, that there was another mode of protecting agriculture besides augmenting the scale of duties. He now adverted to that point and took the opportunity of replying publicly to the various applications which he had received, both for the augmentation of which he had spoken, and for limiting the quantity of foreign corn that should be admitted. His majesty's government, after taking these applications into consideration, did not feel that it would be proper to comply with them, and thought it would be better to take a duty at once on these kinds of grain, rather than suffer it to be continually fluctuating. These resolutions, therefore, were just the same as the bill of last session, with the exception of the alteration in the scale of duties. &#x2014;Now if it were asked why, in this scale, a certain price was selected, he would answer the question as Mr. Canning answered a question of a similar nature
<image src="S2V0018P0I0700"/>
<col>1385</col>
last year. In a fluctuating scale it was impossible to give a specific reason for fixing upon any price. It must vary at different periods. The rate of exchange, the state of our currency, the influence of foreign markets, were all fluctuating circumstances, which were ingredients that entered into the question of a fluctuating duty, and it was therefore impossible to proceed by any arithmetical rule. Such as these resolutions were, he presented them to the House, not as the best that could be framed, but as resolutions which, under all circumstances, were likely to pass into a law, and set this troubled question at rest. If they did pass into a law, they would, in his opinion, be productive of benefit to the country. They would remove an injurious law, protect the interests of agriculture, impress juster notions on the minds of men, and remove those extravagant expectations which prevailed both among the opponents and the supporters of the present laws on the subject of the corn trade. He had spoken of these resolutions as an introduction to something better; but in one point of view they were permanent. As far as the legislature was concerned, they were permanent. They were permanent, until the minds of men could be led to entertain juster notions upon this subject; and would be changed only as the notions which at present prevailed were altered for the better. They were offered to the landed interest as a resting place,&#x2014;as firm and solid ground on which time and experience might accumulate a richer soil. He begged the House to consider this measure as an arbitration or compromise between conflicting interests and opinions. He was free to confess, that he thought the resolutions imperfect, inasmuch as they fell short of the bill of last year; but they had been brought as near to that measure as was consistent with the likelihood of their passing into a law. At the same time he must be allowed to say, that he would not have introduced them if he had not thought that they would be productive of benefit to the country; and if he had not been convinced, that if Mr. Canning had been in his situation, he would have acted as he had acted. Mr. Canning introduced his bill as a compromise, and not as the best measure that could be brought forward on the subject. Mr. Canning had expressly stated, that his bill was a peace-offering, which was likely to be accepted
<col>1386</col>
by the two conflicting parties. He was quite sure that every hon. gentleman had still deeply impressed upon his mind every part of that memorable speech of Mr. Canning's, which was one of the finest specimens of that temperate and chastened eloquence of which Mr. Canning was as great a master as he was of every thing that was delightful in imagination, and in all the most exquisite forms of oratory, which made him at once the ornament of the senate, the pride of those he led, and who were proud to serve under him, and the delight and admiration even of those to whom he had the misfortune to be opposed. He could not restrain himself from taking advantage of this opportunity of paying a tribute to the memory of that illustrious statesman&#x2014;a tribute in which he was sure he should be joined, not only by that House, but by every feeling and intelligent mind in the country. He had now merely to recommend these resolutions to the House; and to implore the House not to treat them as the best which might have been produced, but as all that, under existing circumstances, could be done upon the subject. He then moved,<lb/>
"That it is the opinion of this committee, that any sort of corn, grain, meal, or flour, which may now by law be imported into the united kingdom, shall be admissible for home use upon payment of the following duties." [Here the Chairman read the scale above quoted].</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01251"><member>Mr. W. Whitmore</member><membercontribution> said, he wished to take an early opportunity of protesting against, this measure. If he had differed from the measure of last session, it was impossible that he should not do the same now. The present measure was so complicated, so much at variance with the principles of commercial legislation, and with the real interests of the country, that it was with the greatest surprise he had heard it proposed; and he felt still more determined to oppose it than he had done to oppose the bill of last session. His right hon. friend had talked of the benefit which was to result from this measure, and of the difference between exclusion by law and exclusion by duty. Now, he did not think that it would be productive of any benefit to the country, and he must say, that he could see no possible difference between an exclusion by law and an exclusion by duty. If corn was excluded, except at high prices, he could see no difference between protection which re-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0701"/>
<col>1387</col>
suited from duties and that which resulted from law. If this measure was, as it had been stated to be, a compromise between conflicting opinions, it was a compromise of conflicting opinions in the cabinet, and not in the country. As to the admission of foreign com in the months of July and August last,&#x2014;he believed to the amount of about five hundred thousand quarters, &#x2014;how had it been accumulated? It was bonded in 1825 and subsequently, because it was believed that no higher duty than 12<i>s</i>. would be imposed by government; and when it was found that this expectation was erroneous, it was thought better to pay a duty of 1<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. than to keep the corn in warehouse, or to export it again. That a great loss had been sustained by these transactions, was well known. He had been informed that, in one instance, in which three cargoes of wheat had been brought from Odessa, a loss of 2,000<i>l</i>. had resulted upon the sale of the whole. Now, if this were true, he thought his right hon. friend had made out no case at all. And although this quantity of five hundred thousand quarters of corn had been brought out of bond, it was equally true, that there were only one hundred and twenty thousand quarters in bond now. It was well known that no such trade as this could be carried on; because it was very clearly seen that there was a disposition, on the part of this country, to fix a duty which would amount to a total prohibition; consequently, the present measure was no provision against the difficulties in which this country might be involved. He would sit down with repeating his protest against this measure, because it was against the principles of commercial legislation, and at variance with the best interests of the nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01252"><member>Sir T. Gooch</member><membercontribution> said, it had always been his opinion, that of all the miseries to which the country could be exposed, the perpetual tampering with the Corn-laws was the most productive of mischief. He trusted, therefore, that before the present session drew to a close, something would be done towards a permanent arrangement upon that subject. He would confess that he was strongly prejudiced in favour of the law as it now stood, because he felt it was the best calculated to give that security to the corn-grower which it was necessary that he should have, because it was less liable to those variations which constituted the great evil of the other
<col>1388</col>
systems, and because corn had been lower under its operation, on a comparison with former averages, than was generally admitted by its opponents. As, however, in the conflicting opinions of the House and the country, the existing law could not be persevered in, the best thing that he and those who agreed with him in opinion, could do, was to endeavour to give effect to the present bill; but while he did so, he must object to the mode of taking the averages. The bill of last year held out that 60<i>s</i>. was a fair remunerating price. He agreed that it was, but then the House should take care that the amount which it professed to give should, in point of fact, be secured to the agriculturist. The way in which the averages were taken did not effect that; for out of the 60<i>s</i>. was to be deducted the cost of commission 1<i>s</i>., and of cartage 3<i>s</i>. which would reduce the remunerating price to 56<i>s</i>. Having stated thus much, he would take leave to say, that he felt the most perfect confidence in the noble duke at the head of the government, that he would do nothing to injure the landed interest. In fact, there was no administration since the days of Mr. Pitt on which he relied with so much confidence as on that which now directed the affairs of the country, under the auspices of the noble duke.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01253"><member>Mr. Benett</member><membercontribution> said, that the more he considered the question, the more he was convinced that the agriculturist was entitled to something above what was laid down as the protection in the former bill. The proposition of the right hon. gentleman was certainly an improvement on the bill of last year; the difference between which and the present was, that the present imposed the duty at 2<i>s</i>. higher. He would confess that he did not see why, in the bill of last year, a reduction of Is. in the price should be attended with an increase of 2<i>s</i>. in the duty. The same principle was retained in the present bill, though not carried to the same extent; but, for his part, he could not see why the duty should advance or fall in an increased ratio to the advance or fall in the market price. An hon. gentleman had said, that the reason why there was so much corn in the market last year was, that a quantity of bonded com had keen let out; but since then, when the same cause did not operate, the supply was still considerable. He conceived that, if some modification was not introduced into the warehousing clause,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0702"/>
<col>1389</col>
the effect would be, to render this country greatly dependent upon foreign countries for its supply; and he was borne out in this opinion by the experience of the last year, when 600,000<i>l</i>.duty was paid, though the opinion maintained by many gentlemen on the subject was, that no duty at all would have been paid in that year. Under these circumstances, he thought if the clause was carried in its present shape, they might fairly calculate on an increased import. In what he now said he did not consider the interest of the great landed proprietors, but that of the agricultural labourers, whose comforts must be considerably abridged by the influence of an increased importation. He thought he might say, that the sums paid for working labour amounted to 20<i>s</i>. for every quarter; but if the importation of corn were to increase, the labourer's proportion could not be continued at the same rate as at present. There was a right hon. gentleman then in his eye (Mr. W. Horton) who might suggest as a remedy for the evil that they should encourage the labourers to proceed to Canada. But it was to be considered, that in order to give effect to such a plan, they must send out farmers with capital to direct their industry; and, if possible, a few proprietors also. After all, the effect of the measure must be, to produce great distress at home, a great increase in the amount of the poor-rates, a depressed rate of wages, and an excess of available labour above the demand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01254"><member>Mr. Fergusson</member><membercontribution> said, he could not agree with those who thought that the duty ought to be low; neither did he think that a fixed duty was better than a variable one, the latter being more adapted to the fluctuating interests of the country. He could not help regretting that the low rate of the duty of last year had not been discovered and admitted, before the amendment which was moved by the hon. member for Bridgenorth. Now, however, they had it at 60<i>s</i>. which he believed was what the agricultural interests absolutely required for their protection. It was his opinion that a still higher duty would be better; at the same time he allowed that the House were not to consider any particular body of men, but to legislate for the whole with a view to the general interest. The averages ought not to be taken in England exclusively, but should extend to Scotland and Ireland, which were equally entitled to the protection of
<col>1390</col>
the law. As to the warehousing system, it opened a wide field of discussion upon which he should not enter at present. The right hon. gentleman had said, that there were great interests to be conciliated in the measure he had submitted to the House; but did the right hon. gentleman mean to say, that because there were no great interests to be conciliated upon what appeared to him (Mr. F.) to be a part of the same question, the measure should not be extended to the articles of barley and oats, of which so great a portion of the agriculture both of Ireland and Scotland consisted? Were not Ireland and Scotland entitled to the advantages of this measure? He conceived that they were, and upon that ground would certainly take the sense of the House when the general question came before them, on the propriety of extending it to the two important articles of barley and oats.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01255"><member>Mr. Robinson</member><membercontribution> said, he had heard with pain the resolutions proposed by the right hon. gentleman, especially as he had introduced the name of Mr. Canning, and had described the present measure as the modification to which he had alluded in the House. What Mr. Canning did say on introducing his resolutions in March last, bore a very different interpretation. Mr. Canning had said, that he did not think the resolutions were likely to conciliate ail parties, though the government had paid due regard to their conflicting opinions; but that the balance was in favour of the landed interest. After such an acknowledgment from Mr. Canning was it probable that he would have supported a measure which was still more favourable to the landed interest than that which he had so described? The fact was, that the present ministers, like all other ministers, found it impossible to carry any bill which was opposed by the landed interest. And though he objected strongly to the present measure, he had no hope of being able to carry any measure, or any modification more favourable to the general consumer, than that which was now before the House. An hon. baronet had said, that the landed interests were hardly dealt with, but the arguments on which he relied went upon the assumption that the re-sellers always sold at a profit, which was not borne out by the fact. As a commercial man, and the representative of a commercial town, he objected to the principle, that the landed interest were entitled
<image src="S2V0018P0I0703"/>
<col>1391</col>
to a fixed protection, when all the other interests were exposed to' the casualties and fluctuations of the market.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01256"><member>Lord Morpeth</member><membercontribution> said, that though the measure before the House applied to the article of wheat alone, it would be unwise to consider it as of small importance to the community. The price of bread, the chief article of life, was at all times a subject of deep interest; and the slightest alteration which was likely to affect that price might be of considerable importance. He was of opinion last year, and he still retained the opinion, that if any alteration was made in the law, it should be one that would make bread cheaper instead of dearer to the whole body of the consumers. It was a fact unfavourable to the operation of the present bill that the price of wheat had fallen since the averages were taken. He did not see why the public should not have the benefit of the lower averages. Was it right that, after a succession of seasons not very remarkable for fertility, the people should be told that bread was too cheap? The hon. gentleman who spoke last did not appear to him to have made a fair use of Mr. Canning's language. He did not remember Mr. Canning to have described the measure of last year as favourable to the landed interest; but he did remember him to have said, that if the House of Commons had a spark of spirit, it would not prostrate itself at the feet of the other House of Parliament. Such a sentiment was worthy of the man by whom it was uttered. For his own part, he was willing to afford protection to the agriculturists, but not greater than to the other classes of the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01257"><member>Sir T. Lethbridge</member><membercontribution> observed, that as the fall of prices since July last had taken place under the temporary measure, they had a right to argue that the protection was inadequate. The law had expired on the 1st of May, and what was the average then? Wheat had fallen from 61<i>s</i>. to 52<i>s</i>. and 53<i>s</i>. in the course of six months. Could any one be surprised at this when they looked at the returns for which he had moved? There they would find a regular introduction of bonded corn, though the duty varied between 1<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. at the lowest, and 1<i>l</i>. 18<i>s</i>. at the highest. Even at 61<i>s</i>. the duty was 1<i>l</i>. 2<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. These facts were sufficient to allay the apprehension that the measure was calculated to produce high prices. There
<col>1392</col>
was no ground for saying that the landed interest was that which the government most attended to. On the contrary, he thought it was just the reverse. He hoped, however, to see the day when a better feeling would arise; and he was confident that there was no more effectual way of making corn cheap than by protecting the landed interest. In confirmation of this opinion, he might refer to the history of the last hundred and fifty years, when the old rules of protecting duties, and corresponding bounties on exportation, were in force. There were no bounties included in the present bill, and the omission was, in his judgment, a defect. The prices were then steady: they were now variable. Though he thought the present bill was better than the last, some alteration should be made in the warehousing system, some improvement introduced in the mode of taking the averages, and a drawback or bounty should be afforded on exportation. In his opinion, the price of barley and oats should have been decidedly kept up by the new law. The proposition was not one with which he could profess himself satisfied, although he thought it better than that of the last session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01258"><member>Colonel Sibthorpe</member><membercontribution> concurred in opinion with the hon. members for Wiltshire and Somersetshire that it was highly necessary to keep up the price of barley and oats. The quantity of oats imported into this country from Ireland, in the short period between the 5th of January and the 22nd of March in the present year, had been one hundred and sixty-five thousand quarters; and, if he was not much deceived, the greater portion of those oats had been previously brought from foreign markets into Ireland, to the destruction of the grower at home. Unless a decided protection was given by the new law to oats and barley, a stagnation in the home production of those articles must be the consequence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01259"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> observed, that although he by no means agreed that it was desirable to abstain from ail immediate discussion on the present occasion; and although he thought it an extraordinary anomaly, when a measure was brought forward by a minister of the Crown, that it should be unaccompanied by a full explanation of its merits and character; yet, as the propriety of such a course had been maintained, he would not eater into
<image src="S2V0018P0I0704"/>
<col>1393</col>
any wide field of remark, but would address himself merely to the few observations which had fallen from the hon. members who had prefaced their observations declaring, that they would make no observations at all. And, first, he must state, that the hon. member for Lincoln was under a great mistake in supposing that in the last year a million and a half of quarters of foreign oats had been smuggled into Ireland, and thence imported into this country. He could assure that hon. member, after the most rigid inquiry, that not a single bushel of oats had been so imported in the last, or in the present year. In fact, when the cumbrous nature of the commodity was considered, and the heavy penalties which would follow detection, it was impossible to conceive the existence of such a case of smuggling as the hon. member supposed. The hon. and gallant member for Lincoln was not, however, the only person who was alarmed upon the subject of inferior grain; the hon. member for Somersetshire had expressed the same species of jealousy, and had spoken as though an immense injury had been offered to the agricultural interest, by the opening of the ports, in 1826, for the admission of foreign oats. Now, he was certainly surprised at this complaint, for, in the first place, he thought it had been agreed on all hands, that the measure of opening the ports recommended to his majesty in August, and approved by parliament in the following November, had been a measure peremptorily called for by the circumstances of the time. But an additional fact moreover existed, not merely to prove the necessity of the course adopted, but also that it was a course by which the agricultural interest had not lost a shilling: for although three million of quarters of oats had been imported, yet such was the pressing demand in the country, that the price had still continued constantly above the limitation of the bill of 1815. So that, if the ports had not been opened by the recommendation, under the existing law the oats would still have come in; and come in, as the provisions of that law stood, without paying any duty at all. Therefore it would seem that, to meet the views of the hon. member for Somersetshire, the bill of 1815 must not only be maintained in full strength, but absolutely reinforced to such a degree as not to let in corn at all, even in the most pressing emergency of the state. The hon. member for Somer-
<col>1394</col>
setshire, however, went on to make a still more extraordinary statement; namely, that wheat had been imported into this country in November last at so high a duty as 2<i>l</i>. 0<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a quarter. This was a mistake, and it arose from the hon. baronet's having looked negligently at the return which he quoted. There was no wheat at all imported in the month to which the hon. member referred. It was true that, if wheat had been imported in that month, from the price which it bore in the same market, the duty payable would have been that which the hon. member stated; but no wheat at all had come; the return before the hon. member applied to wheat, "or other foreign grain;" and it must have been some other grain&#x2014;beans, Indian corn, or flour&#x2014;that had been imported in that month: that wheat should have come was utterly impossible. In fact, the returns were before him; and, during the whole time that wheat had. kept the price here in the market of 51<i>s</i>. to 52<i>s</i>., for three successive weeks, the note upon the importation paper was constantly "Nil," "nil," "nil." In the same way, when the hon. member for Somersetshire said again, that corn in July last had been at 61<i>s</i>. a quarter, and in the last month it was at 52<i>s</i>., and that that decline must have proceeded from the importation of the five hundred thousand quarters of wheat since last September, the hon. baronet was right as to his facts, but totally wrong in his deduction. He had forgotten the influences of times and seasons in England. The hon. baronet forgot that our system of monopoly, or something at least which approached to it, gave the mere time of year always a certain effect upon the relative price of corn. July, which was the date of the hon. members high price, was the end of the agricultural year; at that time corn was invariably higher than in those months more immediately following the harvest. If the hon. member had gone further, and compared the prices of the last year with those of former years, he would have found, that the variation between July and February, which he complained of, might have been produced, and constantly had been produced, without, any importation at all. Nay, if the hon. member looked only a little further into the returns before him, he would find the state of all grain the same with that of wheat. Barley and oats had fallen between the July and February
<image src="S2V0018P0I0705"/>
<col>1395</col>
in the same proportion as the higher-priced grain; and he had little doubt that the same means which had produced the fall would ensure the rise again; and that before July next wheat would be as high as it had been in the same month last year. He desired particularly to call the attention of the House to the fact of the difference of seasons, as the statement of the hon. baronet had been calculated to produce an impression, and it certainly was utterly erroneous.&#x2014;The hon. and learned member for Kircudbright (Mr. Fergusson) was one of those who insisted on some law which should keep up the price of barley and oats. But did the hon. and learned member forget, that in the last year those grains had received a considerable advance on the scale proposed? The hon. member forgot that the central point of oats had been advanced from 21<i>s</i>. to 25<i>s</i>., and that of barley from 30<i>s</i>. to 33<i>s</i>.; no corresponding advance being made upon the article of wheat. He was surprised that the hon. and learned member should overlook this point; and that he should not see that 25<i>s</i>. was a higher ratio for oats than 60<i>s</i>. was for wheat. He had looked carefully back to the prices of former years; and he found no instance in which the price at which importation should be permitted had been fixed so high as 25<i>s</i>. The hon. and learned member seemed to think, too, that there was no difference between the scale of duties now proposed, and the amendment moved by the hon. member for Dorsetshire last year. This impression was a mistaken one. The object of the last year's amendment of the hon. member for Dorsetshire had been to raise the pivot price of wheat from 60<i>s</i>. to 64<i>s</i>., but to leave the graduations of the scale, both in the ascent and descent of the duty, as it stood; but it was clear, upon the slightest calculation, that, from the beginning to the end of the scale, that change went to make a most important difference.&#x2014;The hon. member for Bridgenorth had announced his hostility to the resolutions proposed, and his intention to suggest new ones. It would have been as well, he thought, if the hon. member had brought forward his resolutions at once. In fairness, both to the House and to the country, he thought that hon. members who had counter-resolutions to propose, would have done well to have named them on that evening, that they might have gone forth side by side with
<col>1396</col>
those of ministers for general consideration. In this there could neither have been any thing objectionable, nor any needless occupation of time: and ministers, if they were not immediately to have the benefit of hon. gentlemen's speeches, might yet have had the advantage of seeing, and perhaps deriving instruction from their plans. The hon. member for Bridge-north approved neither of the existing law, it appeared, nor of that proposed: for he said, that if the President of the Board of Trade had brought forward the system of the last year <i>ipsissimis verbis</i>, he would have objected to it. The hon. member then complained that the system now proposed was of too complicated a character. Now, he could not see that it was more complicated than that of the last year. The scheme now proposed took the two extremes of the scale as it was formed for the last year, and proposed to enact such regulations as, at the price of 70<i>s</i>., should let in wheat at a merely nominal duty, and, on the contrary, at the price of 60<i>s</i>. should pretty nearly prevent its admission altogether. That was an equitable arrangement, and one which could lead to no inconvenience. When corn was either much wanted here, or at a very low price abroad, it would certainly find its way into the country. Let the House look, however, to what had occurred since last year. It was said that after the bill of last year had received amendment in another place, which materially altered its effect&#x2014;it was said, that in any reconsideration of the subject in a future session, the House ought to proceed with a view to what the result of that bill had been in experience. He agreed with his right hon. friend, that that experience had received more consideration than it deserved: five hundred thousand quarters of wheat, however, had come in when the duty exceeded 20<i>s</i>.; therefore there was a <i>prima facie</i> case made out, that 20<i>s</i>. was not a sufficient duty to exclude. This fact, then, in the construction of the present measure, had been considered; and it was upon that ground that an attempt was contemplated, without departing from the principle of the last year's bill, or sacrificing any of the views which it had embraced, to quiet the apprehension which had arisen out of the importation at a 20<i>s</i>. duty, and to throw an additional drag or impediment in the way by which foreign corn, in a given state of the market, was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0706"/>
<col>1397</col>
to be admitted. All parties last year had been agreed upon the mischief which would arise from permitting large importations of foreign wheat, when the price in the home market was between 60<i>s</i>. and 64<i>s</i>. The measure of the present year was calculated to check such importation: it was no deviation from the principle of the last year's bill, or from the manner in which that bill dealt with the subject; but it was so constructed, as to defeat a possible course, which it was generally agreed, if put in execution, would prove inconvenient. He admitted fully that, in the course of the last year, there had been circumstances calculated to produce a larger importation, at given rates of duty, than was likely to occur again. In the first place, the act of November, 1826, had given the Crown the power to admit five hundred thousand quarters of foreign wheat at 12<i>s.</i> a quarter duty. That power, it was true, had not been exerted, for the occasion for its exercise had not arisen; but the belief that it would be called into effect, and the contemplation of further changes, had brought a large supply of foreign corn into the warehouses of the country&#x2014;a larger quantity, probably, than would otherwise have been introduced. The expectation of the admission of the five hundred thousand quarters at 12<i>s</i>. duty had failed; and the general measure, upon which something had perhaps been calculated, had been defeated in another place; and a short time was open to get rid of a large supply of a commodity which received no benefit from keeping. The result was, that a sort of panic had seized upon the holders of foreign corn in bond, which had produced considerable loss; it had been taken out of bond at high rates of duty, and rapidly forced into consumption. It was necessary, therefore, in any estimate of what had arisen under the last year's law, to consider these circumstances. But the right hon. President of the Board of Trade had stated truly, that it was their duty, as practical men, to look at the measure of the present session as one which was to settle what the rule and what the law was, by which all the transactions of the country relating to the land were to be regulated. The question was one, the final adjustment of which was not merely deeply desirable, but a matter of paramount necessity; for it was one by which all acts and business of men's lives were influenced and governed.
<col>1398</col>
The object of the House should be, to pass a measure which men might believe, and look upon to be, a lasting and a conclusive one;&#x2014;an award, if he might be allowed the expression, between the exaggerated prejudices entertained against all freedom on the one side, and the exaggerated hopes which might have been conceived by the other;&#x2014;a measure which, if it was not the very best which could be introduced, might yet be one which would prove an adjustment of the question so long agitated with so much inconvenience to society;&#x2014;a question, one of the worst effects of the uncertainty of which was, that some particular class of the community was constantly apprehending that its interests were about to be sacrificed to those of another class; while the duty of the House, as well as its real disposition, was to look upon all interests impartially. It was for purposes, and with feelings of this description, that the present measure had been submitted to the House. He did not think it the best which might have been brought forward; but he did believe that it was a measure, when duly considered, which, with reference to all the circumstances of the currency, and the state of public feeling, was more likely to abate those angry squabbles which the absence of final measures had given rise to, than any other which, in the present condition of the country, could be introduced. As to those who objected to it on the score that the interests of agriculture were not sufficiently protected, he had already briefly replied to their observations. The hon. member for Somersetshire professed himself pleased with the law of 1815. He could only say to that hon. member, that he lamented from the bottom of his soul, the mass of evil and misery, and destruction of capital, which that law, in the course of its twelve years' operation, had produced: and he did believe that he could make it distinctly appear, if the moment were a proper one, that the effect of the bill, as far as regarded the agriculturists themselves, had been to keep the prices of produce lower, for those twelve years, than they would have been, even if the trade in corn had been entirel yopen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01260"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, he thought that the complaints of the right hon. gentleman who had last spoken, as to the conduct pursued by some members in that committee, were rather unreasonable. The right hon. gentleman should consider that
<image src="S2V0018P0I0707"/>
<col>1399</col>
these resolutions had been the subject, for many days past, of anxious consultation with the public. For his own part, he should have been much surprised if the committee had not looked a little more nearly than was usual on the occasion of reading such propositions from the chair, in order to see how they bore upon this most important question. Although the principle of the resolutions might be the same, the alteration made in them from the law of last year was considerable, particularly as to the advance in the scale of prices. It was certainly impossible for any one to have opened the question with more candour than the right hon. gentleman; but it was apparent, from the manner of that statement, that before it was submitted to the committee, a hard battle had been fought, to reconcile the conflicting principles of this and of the former measure. His right hon. friend who spoke last had, with somewhat less of candour, defended this proposal, by reflecting on the manufacturing interest on the one hand, and the agricultural interest on the other; and he had concluded by telling the committee, that the measure, such as it was, had not his entire approbation. As for himself, he would acknowledge to the right hon. gentleman that his case was very like that of the person who was only transported, after expecting to be hanged. Various rumours, of an alarming nature, were afloat out of doors, as to the character of the measure now brought forward; and he was glad that it was no worse than it really appeared to be. He had anticipated some system like that of a remunerating price&#x2014;that old proposition which the hon. bart., the member for Somersetshire, had declared he would always defend, as being best adapted to protect the agricultural interest. He should, for one, deprecate the discussion of a principle which could not confer one iota of protection in reality, but which, if persevered in, might one day produce a famine, owing to the absurd prejudice of the agriculturists against permitting the establishment of what might be considered a permanent depot for the supply of grain, at a distance of one thousand or one thousand five hundred miles from their own market. When he saw attempts making, from day to day, to impose restraints upon the supply of corn for a population so vast and so increasing as that of these kingdoms&#x2014;the necessity of which supply was
<col>1400</col>
evident from this, that year after year, we had been blest with abundant harvests, and yet were still, year after year, importing foreign corn&#x2014;he was astonished at such propositions being persisted in. Looking to that population, to the numbers and the condition of the labouring classes, could any man of common sense or common humanity, be jealous &#x2014; of what? of permitting a depot, such as he spoke of, to exist in his neighbourhood, for the supply of all those people with corn. What was the present state of the country? Those who knew the condition of the manufacturing districts would not contradict him, when he asserted, that in all the general branches of manufacture, there was, perhaps, sufficient work for the labourers; but the wages paid them for such work they could but just manage to exist on. The working part of that community, therefore, being in this situation, the masters were enabled to carry on their business to an extent barely sufficient to make some small returns upon their capital. In the mean time these poor people were under the necessity, under such circumstances, of paying 52<i>s</i>. for their wheat. Who could say what might be the consequence of getting this already enormous price up, by possibility, to 64<i>s.</i>? The gentlemen belonging to the agricultural interest, should remember, that the effect of realizing their extravagant expectations would be, to pull that House down about their own ears. It would be presumptuous to pretend to state beforehand to what extent the price of corn might, from circumstances, within a given period, rise; but when they raised that price at once from 52<i>s</i>. to 64<i>s</i>., it was not difficult to foresee the serious effects that might ensue. If the scheme were effected, what would become of the agriculturist himself? Was it not obvious that this was not a question of the manufacturing, or of any other isolated interest. The hon. member for Suffolk might send his team to Ipswich, but what became of him or his farmers if the population were so distressed as to be unable to become customers for his agricultural produce? It might be said that the manufacturing classes should, in that case, be made to work harder&#x2014;that instead of twelve, they should be compelled to labour thirteen or fifteen hours a day; but he would say, that there was a point beyond which they could not go, and arrived at which they would fall upon the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0708"/>
<col>1401</col>
parish as paupers. He was ready to go as far as any man in providing for the agricultural interests, and in maintaining them in that competency which was so essential, not only to the good order, but to the morals of the community; but he never would encourage the unwarrantable expectation that they should be kept up at the expense and to the injury of all other classes. Bad as the old law was, he had great doubts whether it was not much better than this which was now proposed. Any thing was better than a state of law which, professing to impose duties which should force high prices, had had the uniform effect of producing low prices. And why? Because as long as it existed, government had found itself, from time to time, under the necessity of permitting importations of large quantities of foreign corn. Since this law had been resorted to, the minister, at the end of every session, if the weather happened to be a little too dry or too wet, or prices a little too low or too high, had not dared to trust the chances of the season, but had very properly thought it necessary to let in the foreign corn. Many more mischiefs had ensued to the agriculturists than they could possibly have experienced under a well-regulated Corn-bill. The law, as it now stood, was a despotic law in respect of grain. The very limitations it assigned had the effect of forcing up prices, until they reached a point at which foreign grain became immediately admissible. He should say, that any price exceeding 60<i>s</i>. would be an indication of incipient distress. The moment the price got beyond 60<i>s</i>. the duty ought to decline rapidly. If at 60<i>s</i>. there was a duty of 24<i>s</i>., and at 61<i>s</i>. a duty of 23<i>s</i>., it was a scale which ought not to continue. His own impression was, that if the price were to rise beyond 60<i>s</i>., there would be that degree of alarm in the country, which would be productive of the most serious consequences. He could not say, therefore, that he much approved of the measure now proposed, or that he considered it preferable to the existing law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01261"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. gentleman having confessed the measure to be more favourable to his views than he had anticipated, he could not but be much surprised to hear the hon. gentleman afterwards declare his doubts whether the measure were preferable to the existing system, which it was meant to
<col>1402</col>
supersede. He did think that no individual in that House was more deeply impressed than the hon. member with a conviction that any fixed system was preferable to that state of uncertainty, with respect to the Corn-laws, under which the country had laboured for some time past. He had understood the hon. member to say, that for the settlement of the relations of landlord and tenant, and with respect to the trading and manufacturing interests, it was desirable that the price of corn should be fixed, so far as it was to be fixed or made dependent upon legislative intervention. Under the consideration that last year the bill introduced by government had met with the approbation of the hon. member, he was certainly surprised that he should find such essential differences between the present proposition and that of the preceding year, as to declare the measure before the House not preferable to the state of uncertainty of which he had so much complained. For his own part, he should vote for the present measure; for, profiting by the experience of the last few months, he was convinced that it was fair equitable, and just. He should vote for it also, because he conceived that any proposition likely to conciliate the good opinion of the House, and to meet with general concurrence, was desirable in every point of view. Last session the House had passed a measure founded upon the principle now adopted by his right hon. friend, and fixing the importation price at 60<i>s</i>.; but gentlemen must be aware of the view that had been taken of that measure in the other House. That House added to the bill of the Commons an amendment, which prohibited the admission of foreign corn out of warehouse until the average price in the home market should rise even as high as 66<i>s</i>. Until the price amounted to this sum, foreign corn was excluded altogether by the amendment carried in the other House. He was quite satisfied that, if the government of that day had thought that such a measure as was now proposed would have been likely to meet with the concurrence of the other branch of the legislature, his right hon. friend who had introduced the resolutions, and his right hon. friend on his left (Mr. Huskisson), would have modified their propositions, so as to render them conformable to the views of both Houses of Parliament. He was sure that his right hon. friend
<image src="S2V0018P0I0709"/>
<col>1403</col>
would not have hesitated to relax the details of his theory, by any modification not incompatible with his principles, provided he could have obtained that which was so pre-eminently desirable&#x2014;a permanent settlement of this question. For these reasons he thought it did not argue the slightest inconsistency on the part of any man who attached a high importance to the settlement of the question, to acquiesce in the proposition of his right hon. friend, and to receive it with gratitude at his hands, if it appeared likely to pass into a law, which would bring us out of the state of uncertainty in which we had been so long placed. He did not support the resolutions merely because he thought them calculated to pass into a law, but because he considered them reasonable and just in themselves. At the end of the last session, the legislature, despairing of the accomplishment of any permanent measure, permission was given for the admission of the foreign corn then bonded, applying to it the scale of duties determined upon by the bill introduced in that House. Now, the question to be considered was, whether that permission had been taken advantage of? It certainly had been acted upon to a certain extent: a portion of the corn was admitted, but the attention of the House had not been yet distinctly called to the amount admitted in the several weeks, and the duty paid upon it. He was aware that any conclusion must be attended with uncertainty, if the profits of the seller were not ascertained in the account. One great advantage of a permanent law would be, that it would lead to a gradual importation, and would prevent that violent and sudden supply caused by a fluctuating and unsettled system. It appeared, then, from returns of the quantity of wheat taken out for home consumption under the act of last year, that in the week ending the 13th of July, when the duty was 24<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a quarter, thirteen thousand quarters were introduced. In the week ending the 20th of July, when the duty was 22<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., the quantity introduced was forty-seven thousand quarters. In the week ending on the 27th of July, when the duty was still 22<i>s</i>. 8d., there was an importation of nearly fifty thousand quarters. In the next week it was thirty-six thousand quarters; in the following week twenty-six thousand quarters; and in the next thirty-eight thousand quarters. In
<col>1404</col>
the ensuing week, which brought it to the 24th of August, when the harvest was approaching, one hundred and seventy-eight thousand quarters of wheat were admitted, at a duty of 22<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. The duty rose in the following week, which ended on the 31st of August, to 24<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., and there were then eighty-two thousand seven hundred quarters introduced. In the following week the amount was thirty-seven thousand quarters; and in the next, when the duty was again 22<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. thirty-two thousand six hundred and fifty-five quarters were admitted. He acknowledged that no distinct conclusion could be reached, without knowing the proportion of profits at these different periods; but the general result of this calculation would be found favourable to the establishment of a permanent system, as a protection not only to the manufacturing, but to the agricultural population. The law should be prospective and permanent; and it should be founded on the principle of a duty, and not of a prohibition. The hon. gentleman who spoke last had professed a sentiment, in which he fully concurred; namely, that under the present state of society in this country, and considering the vast amount of property employed in the cultivation of land, as well as with reference to the other interests of the community, it was impossible for the House to apply any rigid abstract principles. The hon. gentleman had justly said, that there were other considerations to be attended to besides that of vested interests. He had said that, under a limited monarchy like this, it was of importance to maintain those interests which rendered so much assistance to the government and to the state. He concurred in this observation. He should be sorry to purchase a depression of the price of bread at the risk of interfering injuriously with those vested interests, which were so essential to the maintenance of the other classes of the state.&#x2014;But there was another circumstance which had not been adverted to during the present discussion. It could not be denied that, in consequence of the growing population of this country, there was a necessity for looking to other countries for a supply. It was impossible not to see that, in proportion to the increase of population of late years, the quantity of land employed in the production of corn was diminished; but it was appropriated to the production of more profitable arti-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0710"/>
<col>1405</col>
cles. The increase of manufactures might diminish the growth of corn; but it did not follow that agricultural property was thereby depressed. The land was devoted to the production of milk and butter, and other articles yielding an equally profitable return. If it were proved to him that at any particular time there was less corn grown in the country, he would not, therefore, admit that agriculture was less flourishing. He would first inquire whether other articles were not produced in its stead, which furnished a suitable price. The land, for instance, in the neighbourhood of London and Manchester was not now applied so generally as heretofore to the production of grain; a great portion of it was devoted to pasture. It was quite clear that Great Britain did not produce sufficient corn for her own consumption. But let it not be forgotten, when they were legislating with a view to the general interests of all portions of the empire, that there was, in conjunction with this island, another country, which did not flourish so much in manufactures, but which possessed great fertility, great powers of production, and vast capabilities of improvement, to which he looked forward for a material addition to the prosperity of the nation at large. It should be considered that, the more the House unduly encouraged the importation of foreign corn, the more it interfered with the supply from Ireland. He did not see what difference should be made between the agricultural interests in Ireland and here. The more agriculture was extended in Ireland, the more the demand for British manufactures would be widened. He did not mean to argue, that agriculture in Ireland should be encouraged to the exclusion of foreign nations, but the House should not forget its importance in the scale, and its great powers of production and improvement. He repeated, he did not give his assent to these resolutions because they were a concession to unfounded apprehensions or prejudice, but because he conceived them to be founded in wisdom and justice. He thought them an equitable adjustment of this great question. They appeared to him a fair and reasonable arrangement, as regarded the commercial and manufacturing interests, and certainly afforded a just and proper protection to the agricultural classes. He knew of no measure more likely to engage a general approval. No system that he was aware of would be so
<col>1406</col>
well calculated to prevent the prejudicial changes to which the country had been subject, and to fix a permanent state of things. Much had been said of a remunerating price, and of the standard of 60<i>s</i>., but that could not be secured by any resolution of the House. The price depended upon important causes, over which they had no control.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01262"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that, differing as he did with the right hon. gentleman, he could not give a silent vote on this occasion. The right hon. gentleman, in denominating this a just and equitable proposition, and. one which the country should receive with thanks, had omitted to show in what respect it bore that character. If the right hon. gentleman meant to say that its merit consisted in legislating for the benefit of one class of the community at the expense of the rest, he would be right. The right hon. gentleman considered the measure as constitutional, and of great importance&#x2014; constitutional, because it tended to support the aristocracy of this country, which was subject to a limited monarchy. Now, what was he to conclude from this statement? That the aristocracy were, by this bill, to be insured a higher price than they would otherwise obtain, and that this increased price was to come out of the pockets of the poor. This appeared to him to be contrary to all constitutional principles. For what was the constitutional object of government? Was it not to promote the prosperity of the many? But the: right hon. gentleman would convert it into the aggrandisement of the few. The right hon. gentleman said, that if the House did its duty by agreeing to a certain rate of duty, they would have to apprehend that the Lords, as they had differed from them before, might again differ from them now. This, too, appeared to him an unconstitutional mode of legislating, and such as ought not to be allowed. It was true, that a measure, in order to pass into a law, must meet with the concurrence of the other House: but had it not often occurred that the other House, after having differed from the Commons on various points, had been obliged to come round to their views. He had heard with regret the speech of the right hon. gentleman who had introduced this proposition, because it was evident, from every sentiment he had uttered, that the measure was not one of which he approved. He
<image src="S2V0018P0I0711"/>
<col>1407</col>
had been obliged to bring it forward in the hope that prejudices would in time be removed. But how did this agree with the statement of the right hon. gentleman, and with the speech of the right hon. Secretary, who had just sat down, that this was to be a permanent measure? Was it possible to believe that the manufacturing and commercial interests would endure such a monopoly as this bill would confer upon the agricultural class? The government was not regulating its measures on this subject on the same principles by which the trade in other articles was regulated. If the right hon. gentleman claimed credit for justice and equity, and for acting upon principle, he should show that the importation of corn was to be regulated by the same principles as that of other commodities. There were two ways in which duties were ordinarily regulated. They were either imposed as permanent duties, or <i>ad valorem</i> duties. This was neither the one nor the other, and its effect would be to render the means of subsistence unattainable to the poor. The right hon. gentleman had said, that it was impossible for this country to do without the importation of corn. This was as large an admission as he could wish from the right hon. gentleman. It went so far as to concede, that if land could be better employed in the production of milk, butter, or other articles, the right hon. gentleman would be content to look to other countries for a supply of corn. But the right hon. gentleman did not seem to recollect that, in proportion as he raised the price of provisions, he cramped the manufacturing and all the other interests, and even, by a natural re-action, the agricultural interest itself. The hon. member for Wiltshire had said that, in proportion as we imported a million quarters of foreign corn, labourers would be thrown out of employment. Now, he did not believe that this would be the result. He believed it would be quite the reverse. Labourers would be employed in manufacturing and other pursuits, to pay for that importation. He contended that the true interests of the country required that we should admit as much corn as we could to feed the people, and improve the condition of the country, by giving employment and wages to those whom the monopoly of the agricultural interest would deprive of the opportunity of industry, It was said, that these measures
<col>1408</col>
were to be founded on a principle of duty and not of prohibition. For his part, he could not see the value of that theory, if the duty amounted in effect to a prohibition. It was changing names without changing the relative situation of the country. One hon. member had said, that the agricultural interest imperiously demanded such a protection as the present measure would afford them. Now, he should be glad to know what right the agricultural interest had to demand any particular rate of duty. The commercial and manufacturing interests had as much right, he conceived, to demand as fair and just a rate. It was the duty of the House to look equally to all the relative interests, and not to suffer itself to be dictated to by one, to the prejudice of the other. But such was the situation in which the government was now placed. The right hon. gentleman would not have proposed this measure of his own accord, but the influence of the landed interest was necessary to be considered. The cabinet was now taking the part of the agricultural against the manufacturing and commercial interests. It was impossible that the country should remain quiet under the operation of such partial and unconstitutional principles. It was said that, with a debt of 800,000,000<i>l</i>. it was impossible for us to have cheap corn. But was it not a gross inconsistency that the public, who were so heavily taxed to pay the interest of this debt, should also be taxed in the high price of corn? If the agricultural interests paid more in the shape of poor-rates, tithes, and for the support of the clergy, than the other classes, let them make their charge and prove their account. He should be willing not only to allow it, but also to consent that ample provision should be made for their protection. The increased value of the currency, owing to the disappearance of the small notes, had not been taken into account, on the present occasion. It should have been considered, in reference to this measure, that what was last year calculated at 60<i>s</i>. would now amount to 63<i>s</i>. or 64<i>s</i>., in point of the tax upon the country. He considered that the importation of corn should be placed upon the same footing as that of other articles. The present system would only produce dissatisfaction, and the House would be perpetually called on for alterations of it. As the right hon. gentleman had said that this was the time for gen-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0712"/>
<col>1409</col>
tlemen to state any proposition which they might have to submit, he would beg to make known the notions which he entertained on the subject. He was of opinion that a rate of duty should be fixed, which he would at present consent should exceed any thing that the agricultural interests had a right to demand, and which should gradually decrease, until it reached a certain standard, at which it should be permanent and immutable. He should be prepared to prove that the agricultural classes had no right to a greater protection than eight or ten shillings a quarter; but he would consent to its being fixed, for the first year at fifteen shillings, which should be diminished by one shilling a quarter until it descended to ten shillings, and there it should be fixed. He would propose that barley should be imported for the present year at a duty of nine shillings, and should decrease by one shilling at a time, until it was settled at seven shillings, The same principle he would apply to oats, and other species of corn. He was aware that even improvements, if too suddenly introduced, might be turned into injuries, and he therefore proposed this gradual reduction to avoid the ill effects of too sudden a change of system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01263"><member>Colonel Wood</member><membercontribution> maintained, that the interest of the agriculturists and manufacturers were closely identified, and could not be severed, without detriment to one or the other. He therefore disapproved of the attempt which was too often made in that House to set them in opposition with each other. As to the hon. member for Aberdeen's system of fixed duties, it never could be acted on, because, in years of scarcity, duties would be, as they had always been, set aside to meet the wants of the country. He was of opinion, that the scale proposed on the present occasion was a considerable improvement on that of last year. Such being his view, he would declare his intention of giving the bill founded on these resolutions his support. He apprehended little danger from any attempt to excite popular feeling with respect to this question. The lower classes were beginning to find out that they were not so materially interested in the question of cheap bread as it was wished to make them believe they were. They were now pretty generally convinced that low bread brought low wages.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01264"><member>Colonel Trench</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that these resolutions would be very beneficial
<col>1410</col>
to Ireland, and have a strong tendency to restore peace and happiness to that country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01265"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, he was prepared to maintain that a free trade in corn would be found most advantageous to the agricultural interest as well as to all the other great interests of the country. After having listened attentively to the speeches of the Secretary for the Colonies, the President of the Board of Trade, and the Secretary for the Home Department, he was persuaded that they were strongly inclined to take the same view of the question that he, did, though they, in their discretion, did not feel justified in avowing their opinions altogether so openly as he did, who was unconnected with office, and free from responsibility. He would not trouble the House further on this point at the present moment; but he wished it to be understood, that he would bring the question substantively under the consideration of parliament before the close of the session. It, however, appeared to him that most persons mistook the real nature of the question which they were called upon to consider. It was not so much a question of corn as of currency; and it was impossible to talk about the price that things would bear, unless persons were prepared to look at the state of the currency, which was the measure of that price. He was satisfied that the distress of the country was in a great measure, fictitious. He saw, that in the midst of substantial wealth, of improvements of every description, the agricultural, manufacturing, mercantile, trading, and shipping interests, were equally distressed,&#x2014;were all affected by one and the same cause. There could not be a more mischievous mistake than holding out to the people at large, that different ranks of society, different professions and callings, had, in fact, a divided interest. That was not the case, and nothing could be so false as to imagine that the manufacturing interest could flourish if the agricultural interest were depressed. What was the manufacturing interest but the surplus produce of the agricultural interest worked up into various shapes? All other interests grew out of the agricultural interest, and all flourished and prospered together. The expenditure, the great debt of the country, had been framed on a high-price system. The country could only be raised to the state of prosperity from which it had fallen, by a de-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0713"/>
<col>1411</col>
parture from what he conceived to be a mistake in legislation. Cheap bread, as it was called, was no advantage to the poor; who always received wages in pro portion to the price of corn. If the currenscy were still to be contracted, he was satisfied the result of that measure would be to throw the country into the same degree of distress front which it had a little recovered. There never would be permanent prosperity until the country was placed in the situation in which it stood before the distress was felt, and in which persons would be enabled to pay the: taxes which pressed upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01266"><member>Mr. Ward</member><membercontribution> declared his approbation of the bonding system, which had been objected to by an hon. member. That system had received the support of Pitt, Fox, and Liverpool. The whole question was, whether goods should be warehoused on this, or on the other side of the water. If they were warehoused abroad, they might, in case of war, be made: available to the purposes of the enemy. It was estimated that the goods warehoused in France last war would: have required one bundled thousand tons of shipping, and six thousand or seven thousand seamen; to transport them to this country. This, it should be observed, might happen, at the moment when the government was called upon to use the utmost exertions to man the navy, and when insurances would be high. He hoped the agriculturists would not be able to defeat the present measure, as they had done that of last year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01267"><member>Mr. Monck</member><membercontribution> agreed, with the hon. member for Westminster, that the greater share of the difficulties the committee had to contend with, arose out of the last enactments relative to the currency. He also thought with, him, that if it were not for the national debt and the burthens it entailed on the public, it would be of comparatively little consequence whether a certain quantity of wheat were one shilling or ten shillings in price. The question was altogether one of price; and the state of the currency must determine the point at issue.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CITIES AND BOROUGHS POLLS REGULATION BILL.]</title><p id="S2V0018P0-01269"><member>Colonel Davies</member> moved the further consideration of the Report of this bill.</p>
<col>1412</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01270"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, that, the bill made a complete alteration in the mode of taking the poll, and was an unnecessary piece of legislation. Instead of facilitating the taking of polls, it would complicate the matter, and throw a degree of power and influence into the hands of the: returning officer, who was generally a party man, which it was highly injudicious that he should possess. The erection of separate and additional places for polling would be of no benefit; for the delay at present was occasioned, not by the undisputed, but by the disputed votes. The proposed exanimations upon oath, especially of the voters as to their qualification, was a useless novelty. The hon. colonel bad framed a measure very applicable, perhaps, for Worcester, but totally unfit for most other boroughs in the kingdoms The bill would increase the intricacy and uncertainty of elections, while it offered no adequate advantage for the many disadvantages it introduced into the system. As an amendment he would move, that the report be taken, into further consideration on that day six. months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01271"><member>Mr. Robinson</member><membercontribution> put it to his hon. colleague, if the bill were to pass the House as it now stood, what security, since the voters were obliged to go to a particular place to poll, was there given that the returning officers would not exercise their influence to induce the electors to give their votes to the candidate favoured by the returning officer? In. his opinion, great evils must flow from the measure, if carried into effect. Besides, he saw no reason for the candidates being put to the additional expense which this measure must entail on them, in the erecting of hustings. He did not see what use there possibly could be in the adjournment of the poll for forty-eight hours after the opening of the election. This would; be giving a convenient time for the exercise of bribery on the part of those who would be inclined to exert it. With respect, however, to the present system, he did not mean to say that it was free from objections; but he thought it better than the measure proposed, than which nothing could, be more obnoxious, to his constituents.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01272"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> thought, that a postponement until after the holidays might be advisable, but could not consent to any amendment, the effect of which would be to defeat the bill. The subject was one
<image src="S2V0018P0I0714"/>
<col>1413</col>
of great importance, and he wondered how any hon. member, who had witnessed the nuisance of a borough election, I could urge that it was a matter not important enough for legislation. He had stood eight contested elections in his time; three where the voters amounted to eight hundred; and five at Norwich, where the electors were between three and four thousand. In the latter city the polling never occupied more than one day and a quarter; and any candidate who should propose to keep the poll open for four days, would stand no chance of success. Two large booths were erected, each with eight polling places, and the returning officer, with his assessor at his elbow, decided upon disputed votes without interrupting the poll. He did not mean to say that the bill upon the table was as complete as it could be rendered; but he would venture to say, that in six days the strongest contest might be disposed of. To effect this object, hon. members must dare to run a little counter to the wishes of corrupt voters, for to them only was the protraction of an election of advantage. Such a limit would contribute to the benefit of the city or borough, to the profit of the candidates, and to the purity of the electors. In his opinion, fifteen days for polling were no more needed than fifteen years, if the matter were properly regulated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01273"><member>Lord Lowther</member><membercontribution> said, he did not oppose the bill because it increased the number of polling booths, but because it introduced fresh confusion into a subject already sufficiently involved. Whenever this question had been discussed the example of Norwich had been adduced; but he saw nothing in the bill which would liken elections in other places to elections in that city. The reason why elections at Norwich lasted so short a time was, that no objection was ever taken to the votes of paupers, who were allowed to come up to the poll by hundreds. In borough elections, disputes regarding such voters were the chief cause of delay. They were admitted at Norwich and rejected at Worcester, and hence the reason why, at one place the election lasted a day and a quarter, and at the other it occupied fifteen days. The principal objection he felt to the measure was, the wide discretion it gave to returning officers. The duty of the officer was, now, to hold the poll where it had been usually held for the
<col>1414</col>
last forty years, but by the alteration he would be enabled to hold the poll where he pleased. He also objected to limiting the number of days for taking the poll.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01274"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> approved of the principle of the measure; but as, in its present shape, he could not agree to it, he hoped it would be revised. He thought that every place ought to bear the expenses of the elections that were had in it; and recommended that the system which had been found for fifty years, to work well in the city of London, should be taken as the model for elections generally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01275"><member>Mr. Fyshe Palmer</member><membercontribution> bore testimony td the corrupt conduct of returning officers; who often canvassed, and resorted to still more iniquitous practices, to ensure the return of their favourite candidate. If he thought that the object of the measure was to increase the influence of those officers, he would oppose it; but, as he believed it would have the effect of checking their unfair practices, he should give it his support, provided it received in the committee some of those alterations which, he thought necessary. He was particularly desirous to see some measure carried into effect which would prevent the mischievous protraction of elections. To instance one borough in which that practice was carried to a most injurious extent. In Reading, at the last election, 86 electors were potted on the first day; on the second, 354; oh the third, 374; on the fourth, 752; on the fifth, 37; of the sixth, 15; on the seventh, 16; and on the eighth, 12. Now, it was quite clear, that if so large a proportion could be polled in the three first days, the same period would be enough to poll all the electors; and if there were three polling places, then one day, or at the most two, Would be enough. There could be no doubt that the election to which he alluded might have been finished much earlier than it was; but the returning officer on being urged to do so, said he would not do any thing to hazard the return of Mr. Monck, before the day fixed for closing the poll. He did not approve of that part of the bill which gave the returning officers the power of keeping the poll open for forty-eight hours, because that gave them an opportunity of canvassing for their friends; but so much as tended to shorten the duration of polls he held to be not only expedient, but absolutely necessary to ensure the purity of election.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01276"><member>The Attorney-general</member><membercontribution> said, that the; bill, however shaped, could not meet with his support. The measure might be calculated for Worcester, but he was certain it would not do in other boroughs differently situated. He thought six days were not enough for large boroughs, where the number of voters might exceed six or eight thousand. There would be great difficulty in fixing a period of time to suit all cases and all boroughs, however differently they might be situated as to extent and population. Another important objection to the bill was, the encouragement it held out for collusion between the two candidates. His objections were not to any one or more clauses in the bill, but arose from a full persuasion of the injury likely to arise from it generally, in addition to Its being a serious infringement on the privileges of the whole constituent body.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01277"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> was of opinion that the subject was peculiarly entitled to the consideration of the House. The period now occupied in taking the polls was unquestionably too long. Before the year 1784, when the period for elections was unlimited, they occupied only two or three days, with the exception of Westminster. It had been found, both in London and Norwich, that a short time was sufficient to poll all the electors; and thus it was proved that the difficulty of polling a great number of voters, on which so much stress had been laid, might be easily got over. He was not disposed to look so much to the convenience of out-voters, as some members did. If they chose to exercise their elective franchise, they had the opportunity of doing so. He considered the proposed regulation of the magistrates at Quarter Sessions having the power, under certain restrictions, of fixing upon a suitable place where the election should be held, would remove many inconveniences which now existed, particularly in small town-halls, where it had been contrived that one body of electors should resist the other in ascending the staircase to give their votes. He alluded to Weymouth on a recent occasion, as affording an instance arising from this evil. As regarded collusion between the candidates, he contended that such collusion was as easy to be discovered on the second or third day, as on the sixth. He considered the latter part of the bill most useful, and could not conceive how it could be considered as holding out an encouragement to, cor-
<col>1416</col>
ruption. As to out-voters, there was no doubt that, according to the present system, fourteen days would not be sufficient; but it was the duty of electors to attend, if they thought their franchise was of value. It was also known that, however long an election might last, there was a class of voters who would hold back as long as they could, in order to see how things were going; and who would say, "if we vote at once nobody will be obliged to us." The out-voters, too, had no objection to the jollity of an election, and living at other people's expense for a considerable time: to prevent all which, he thought the bill an excellent remedy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01278"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that if he was called upon to give his vote, it would be for the amendment of the hon. gentleman. It was desirable, indeed, that the poll should be shortened, so that electors in general were not aggrieved. The period should be fixed, with reference to the number of voters at each place. In Westminster, for instance, where the number of voters was twenty thousand, six days, which would suffice for other places, would be utterly insufficient. When he saw the bill giving additional power to that already possessed by the returning officers, he must withhold his vote from it. He objected also to that part of the bill which related to separate polling booths. This might be convenient in some respects; but it was a custom consonant with the principles of the constitution for the candidate to be present at the place of election, that he might, if necessary, be questioned by the voters; and he thought this was an advantage which ought not to be given up for other, perhaps fallacious, advantages. With respect to the duration of polls, there were modes and devices, under the present bill, by which the voting might be retarded. He was, however, not disposed to object to lessening the duration of polls in general.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01279"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> observed, that so many gentlemen were of opinion that the bill might be improved by further consideration, that he should recommend the hon. member to withdraw it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01280"><member>Mr. Sugden</member><membercontribution> objected to the bill. If it had passed before the last election for Weymouth, he should not have been there to offer his opposition to it. It was perfectly certain that force was used on that occasion; and, according to this bill, it
<image src="S2V0018P0I0716"/>
<col>1417</col>
would have been necessary to have put an end to the contest, long before he was at the head of the poll. He objected strongly to that part of the bill which gave additional powers to the returning officer. In some places, this officer was a common constable; and he had the power after three days, of going into a separate place, in company with lawyers, and making his return at once. This bill, in fact, put the whole power of electing the member into the hands of the returning officer. He objected also to putting the elector to his oath, as unconstitutional and leading to perjury. It gave a vexatious power to an agent, perhaps a lawyer, to expose the private pecuniary concerns of an elector, and ran sack all his affairs; because the elector, after taking the oath, would be obliged to answer all questions. Such a practice would have the effect of deterring electors from coming to the poll. He was not averse to the reduction of the time of polling, but each particular place must be regulated by the circumstances peculiarly affecting it. No universal rule could be laid down to apply to every city and borough in the kingdom; Though he was no friend to general reform, yet he could not agree to lessen the franchise by creating new and additional restrictions on its exercise. If a period too limited were fixed, the effect would be, that the non-resident voters would be deprived of their suffrage. He would be happy to assist the hon. gentleman in curtailing the time of the poll, but not to six days, as had been proposed, and compelling the returning officer to provide a sufficiency of polling places; and also, where necessary, to remove the place of election to a more convenient place, but not beyond two miles. He advised, however, that the bill should be withdrawn; as, in its pre sent shape, it would certainly be defeated, if pressed forward.</membercontribution></p>

<title>POOR-LAWS IN IRELAND.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01283"><member>Mr. James Grattan</member><membercontribution> presented a petition from the silk
<col>1418</col>
weavers of Dublin, praying that the House would make some permanent provision for the Poor of Ireland. The hon. gentleman impressed upon the House the expediency of attending to the prayer of the petition, which related to a subject which was every day exciting additional attention in Dublin, Cork, and other parts of Ireland. He was decidedly of opinion, that if hon. gentlemen were to look to the various returns on the table they would be convinced of the necessity of some measure for enforcing the attention of the gentry of Ireland to the means of employment for the poor, in the view of their maintenance, instead of resorting to a system of emigration. The petitioners complained of the distress brought upon the country by the drain of capital from it, in consequence of absenteeism. His own opinion was, that some system of Poor-laws must be established in Ireland. He had himself ascertained recently in Dublin, that three thousand looms in that city were unemployed, and that the persons dependent on them, to the number of twenty-one thousand, were in a state of the utmost distress.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01284"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> thought that the Poor-laws and Poor-rates, if established in Ireland, would be productive of most extensive mischief, and that a very small portion only of the fund would reach the hands of the poor. He should protest against the introduction of them into that country, as the most dreadful visitation, that could be inflicted on it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01285"><member>Mr. Maurice Fitzgerald</member><membercontribution> said, that the public opinion in Ireland was not favourable to the introduction of that system. The statement of his hon. friend was calculated to turn away the attention of parliament, from the consideration of the real and practical remedies for Irish grievances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01286"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that his attention had often been directed to this subject, but the only conclusion to which he could come was, that the introduction of the English system of Poor-laws into Ireland would be most injurious to that country. Indeed, he could scarcely imagine any new country, into which the system of Poor-laws that, under various circumstances, had grown up in England, could be planted with safety. Then, the peculiar state of the country should be considered; and, looking to the tendency to an increased population already in Ireland, he should rather think that the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0717"/>
<col>1419</col>
application of those laws to it would, by holding out a settlement to the poor, remove every check on population, and encourage more early marriages, and a still greater subdivision of the land. Then, as to the administration of the machinery, he could not see how it could be effected in the absence of the resident gentry. At the same time he was willing to admit, that the situation in which Ireland stood towards England, particularly in relation to the Poor-laws, was most unsatisfactory; but then, as to the application of the English Poor-laws to Ireland, even though its policy were allowed, there could not be found for years a machinery competent to execute the system, Still there were many circumstances that pressed the consideration of it on parliament; such as the relative situation of the two countries since the Union, the facilities of access in consequence of steam navigation, and other matters, which, though not sufficient to induce him to consent to the introduction of the Poor-laws into Ireland, were enough to call for the attention of parliament, particularly so far as they tended to throw the burthen of Irish poverty on England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01287"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution>, after declaring his entire concurrence in the opinions of his right hon. friend, took that occasion to deny that he had ever contemplated removing the unemployed poor to foreign countries; for he could never be brought to think that British colonies were foreign countries. If the poor could not get employment at home, what was to be done with them? Would it be said, that they should be supplied with work and subsistence at the expense of a parliamentary grant? If hon. members would say so, then he would join issue with them on that ground, and contend, that such parliamentary grant would be better spent in taking them to the colonies where there was much land unappropriated, than to expend it on them at home, where they could find neither cheap land nor profitable employment. The attempt to give parliamentary support at home to the unemployed men, women, and children, would cost no less a sum than 300,000<i>l</i>. a-year, taking the subsistence for each human being at its lowest rate of 3<i>l</i>. a head. As to the introduction of the Poor-laws into Ireland, under its present circumstances, it would be a hopeless proceeding, as the only effect it could produce
<col>1420</col>
would be to monopolise all the rental of the land. He would admit, however, that the closer admixture of the two countries since the Union, and the facility of transmission by steam navigation, must ultimately produce a state of things in which it would be found necessary to equalize the laws relative to the poor in both countries; and the system of English Poor-laws, if judiciously modified, would, he had no doubt, be productive of good; provided relief were given only to poverty brought on by old age and accidental infirmities, and if the children were not reared in the expectation that they were, in case of poverty, to have a lien on the land. As to the plan of supporting the poor by expending money in procuring employment for them, he was sure that 100,000<i>l</i>. spent in creating that artificial employment, would but aggravate the evil; as the labour would produce no return for the capital so expended on it. He should, however, have no objection to the expenditure of a moderate sum in that way, as an experimental measure, if an object, such as the cultivation of waste lands, could be found, of a nature likely to give a fair return for the outlay of capital. On the whole, the present condition of the pauper population of the three kingdoms, was such as called for the most serious attention of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01288"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> approved of the principle of the Poor-laws, and had always ascribed the evils arising from them to the relaxed administration of them. The introduction of them into Ireland, he would oppose, as tending to produce more permanent destitution in that country than existed there at present; nor could he see what good emigration could do, as he was sure, if a hundred thousand paupers were transported to the colonies to morrow, the gap would be filled up, in a few years, with a hundred thousand more as needy as the former. Before the government adopted any measure of the kind, they ought to inquire into and remedy the grievances of the poor. There were many other remedies for the evils of Ireland. He was sure there would be neither peace nor happiness in Ireland until Catholic emancipation was granted. This should be the foundation of all remedial measures: then the expenses of government ought to be reduced to the lowest possible scale. In fine, he could not see how emigration could cure the evils of England; or the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0718"/>
<col>1421</col>
introduction of the Poor-laws heal the grievances of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01289"><member>Mr. Monck</member><membercontribution> thought that the evils of Ireland arose from the fact, that her population was a nation of producers, and not of producers and consumers, like that of England. Absenteeism also was another cause. The Poor-laws of England were the sole partition between English comforts and Irish misery. If it were possible to reduce England to the same situation as Ireland now found herself in, the landlords of both countries would become mere exporters, instead of importers and consumers of produce.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01290"><member>Colonel Trench</member><membercontribution> was sorry to say that there was but too much truth in the statement which the hon. member had just made. He hoped, however, that the true remedy was about to be applied to the miseries and evils with which Ireland had been too long afflicted. He could assure the House, that there was an immense desire throughout the Irish population, to learn by their own exertions and labour an honest livelihood. The best proof of this fact was to be found in the constant emigration of the Irish poor to England; a grievance so much and so justly complained of. The true cause of the overpopulation of Ireland, and of all the troubles which ensued from it, was the infinite subdivision of the land; and he could not help saying, that the main spring of the immediate evils which oppressed her was a circumstance to which little or no allusion had been made; namely, the anxious desire of every body who was an Irish land-owner to produce a crop of free-holders of the smallest possible quantity of land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01291"><member>Mr. Croker</member><membercontribution> said, it was his firm conviction, that the state of England and Scotland, labouring as they now did under what he must call the infliction of Irish emigration, would oblige this country to turn her attention towards the necessity of providing some great measure of relief for Irish pauperism.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01292"><member>Mr. W. Lamb</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that the Secretary of State for the Home Department had stated the most unanswerable reasons why it was impossible to extend to Ireland the Poor-laws of England, in any considerable degree. He was quite willing to allow, that much of the evil which had arisen in Ireland, might possibly be owing to the deficiency of Poor-laws in that country. But before parlia-
<col>1422</col>
ment attempted to apply those laws to Ireland, let them wait, to see to what extent they could first be reformed in England. With regard to the plans which had been suggested by a right hon. gentleman, he must observe, that the financial difficulties of a country could not be relieved by schemes which began with borrowing large sums of money, on the security of a distant prospect of very doubtful returns. Neither was it possible that one part of the empire, like Ireland, could be benefitted in her own case, by that which was in effect a loss to the empire at large. The only remedies which he could imagine for a country labouring under the difficulties he spoke of, were patience, perseverance, rigid economy, strict punctuality, determined enterprise, and unwearied labour. These were hard conditions, he admitted; but they were the conditions upon which alone the affairs of states could be re-established, and which were at the same time the conditions of the tenure of our common existence.</membercontribution></p>

<title>WEST INDIA PRODUCE &#x2014; DUTY ON<lb/> SUGAR.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01294"><member>Mr. C. N. Pallmer</member><membercontribution> said, he had to present a petition to the House, and his great respect for the body who had intrusted it to his care, induced him to entreat their patient attention to its important contents. It proceeded from a great national interest&#x2014;an interest at one time, and he hoped still, a cherished object of the country's favour&#x2014;one of the principal sources of her maritime strength and commercial prosperity. It was from the West-India planters and merchants of London, and it prayed for a reduction of the tax upon their sugar. He presented the petition to the House, divested of any political expression or feeling, as a plain, argumentative appeal to their impartiality and their justice, founded upon figures which could not err, and facts which could not be denied. The petition described the rise and progress of the sugar duties from 3<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. per cwt to the present high rate of 27<i>s</i>., and it particularly adverted to the great addition which was made to the duties during the late war, under the express provision of the act of parliament, that the same were for the purposes of the war alone. Twelve years had since elapsed; every other war duty had been removed; many other taxes had been
<image src="S2V0018P0I0719"/>
<col>1423</col>
taken of altogether; but the duty on sugar remained the same. Upon representations having been made on the subject to former ministers, it had been answered, that the West Indies derived certain advantages from bounty upon the export of refined goods&#x2014;that bounty had been since taken away, and the tax still continued. At the close of the war a large accession was made to our colonial possessions, and these, with the addition of the Mauritius, added materially to an oppressed and overloaded market; and yet, from the heavy tax which it had to sustain, not only had the consumption of sugar failed to keep pace with that of other articles, but the poorer classes had been entirely debarred from it; and even with those classes which had been accustomed to its use, its consumption had not increased, in proportion to the increased population of the country; and it was proved by the most authentic documents, that the consumption had been sensibly augmented or diminished, as the average price of the article had risen or fallen&#x2014; that, independent of the general rule, that a diminution of price necessarily produced an increased consumption, that result had been practically illustrated in the article of coffee, in respect to which, as the petition shewed, a reduction of two-thirds of the duty, produced in the year a revenue of more than double the amount; and a partial restoration of the duty produced a proportionate diminution of revenue'&#x2014;that the article of sugar, if placed within their reach, would be consumed by the very lowest classes, and in such case the consumers would be scarcely less numerous than the consumers of bread; and that to the inhabitants of the sister kingdom, if it could be supplied at an attainable price, it would not fail to afford not only comfort, but great moral benefits&#x2014;that the West-India planters were essentially British land-owners, cultivating articles in amount from eight to nine millions sterling value, creating a revenue of nearly six millions, being upon the whole produce about seventy-five per cent, and upon sugar upwards of one hundred per cent&#x2014; that sugar and coffee were to the colonial, what grain was to the British agricultural interest, and the export of British goods to the West-India colonies, diminished as it was, by their necessities and other causes still amounted to nearly five millions; their commerce employed four
<col>1424</col>
million ton of British shipping, and from twenty to twenty-five thousand men&#x2014;that the average price of sugar during the last year, which was higher by many shillings than the five preceding years, was 63<i>s</i>. per cwt. of which 27<i>s</i>. was paid to the government, 8<i>s</i>. to the British ship-owner and merchant, 18<i>s</i>. to the expenses of cultivation, leaving about 10<i>s</i>. to the grower, or somewhere about one penny per lb., the government receiving a tax of three hundred per cent on the profit of the grower. The petition concluded by praying such an ample reduction of duty as would ensure to the grower and consumer a participation in the relief, give encouragement to British shipping, and the consumption of British manufactures, and increase in a very material degree the comforts of the labouring poor of the whole empire. Such was the petition. He trusted that it would, at least, have the effect of laying before a misinformed public the real merits of the case, and the remarkable fact, that the tax to the government, and not the profit of the grower of West-India sugar, was the real cause of its high price to the community. He implored the House to bestow upon it a more than ordinary attention, whether they regarded it with reference to colonial interests, the interests of the manufactures and shipping of the country, the national revenue, or the more important consideration of the comforts of the labouring classes in the colonies, and in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01295"><member>Mr. C. Grant</member><membercontribution> declined at that moment to enter upon the important subject referred to in the petition. He was not insensible to its importance; but another and more fitting opportunity would arrive for discussing it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01297"><member>Sir Robert Wilson</member><membercontribution>, in rising to bring forward his motion for a Return of the Official Value of Exports to the States of South America, said that he felt some embarrassment, because he had to reply to accusations against those states, which came not from unknown or irresponsible parties, but from those who, by their station, gave; greater weight to the charges they brought. He did so, however, because he was desirous that the South American States should see, that if there were persons who traduced them unjustly, and used harsh: and severe language towards them in this
<image src="S2V0018P0I0720"/>
<col>1425</col>
country, there were others, who, wholly disinterested, would come forward to vindicate their character. It did unfortunately happen, that the South American States had enemies in this country&#x2014;persons who saw with regret their emancipation from tyranny, and who did not look upon them with a friendly eye, because they had released themselves from those aristocratic pretensions, which, however respected and respectable, were more frequently accompanied with injury than benefit. There were also persons who had the same feelings from party motives, and who, from dislike to that great man now no more (Mr. Canning) who had interposed the &#x00C6;gis of England between South America and the powers confederated against them, were disposed to undervalue what he had taken so just a pride in bringing forward. That attempt, however, was vain, as the name of that individual was consecrated by America whilst living, and the order of respect to his memory, which had been published by the government of Mexico, and by the liberator of Colombia, had been merely a compliance with the unanimous feelings of the people. The hon. and gallant member then said, that the charges made were, that one state, for unworthy motives, preferred a corsair war to the benefits arising from peace and industry; the next assertion was, that the trade with South America generally, was of comparatively little value to the British empire; and the third charge was, that in all pecuniary transactions with this country, these States had played only the character of swindlers, and had brought nothing but infamy on themselves and their friends. With respect to the first charge, that Buenos Ayres had only carried on a corsair warfare, to the prejudice of others and the benefit of themselves, the reverse was the fact, because Brazil was the only state which gained by it; and, at all events, before these charges were made, it should be shewn that Buenos Ayres had rejected the propositions which had been made. Here the hon. member went into details of the trade of Buenos Ayres during the years 1823, 1824, and 1825, shewing that their exports averaged eleven millions of dollars, and their imports eight; the profits of which were much greater than any they could derive from a state of war. Then, as to the value of the South American trade generally, the value of that to Brazil, from 1822 to
<col>1426</col>
1826, amounted to between fifteen and sixteen millions sterling, while to other parts of that continent it came to near fifteen millions and those sums nearly comprised the direct trade with England, although it was much greater through Jamaica and other islands, which had constant intercourse with the Spanish Main. All the accounts, too, which had lately arrived, shewed that those States were recovering from the depreciation caused by the supply being at first greater than the demand, and that the consumption of British manufactures was greatly on the increase. He did not deem it necessary to go at length into mining speculations, but thought that if properly managed they might ultimately succeed; there was this strong argument in their favour, that in Mexico alone, the quantity of bullion produced from the year 1733 to 1826, was on the average 3,000,000<i>l</i>. sterling per annum. He then proceeded to notice the advance made in refinement and civilization, the number of books and pamphlets that were circulated there, and the general extension of intellectual and moral culture. He also called the attention of the House to the circumstance of slavery having been abolished. It was to the consumption, by these countries, of our manufactures, that we were to look for the employment of our population, and it would ill become us, like so many children, to be pettish and discontented because a temporary re-action had occurred. Columbus did not change his course, though apparently adverse circumstances arose; neither should this country, on the first appearance of unfavourable circumstances, give up all that she had so nobly achieved. It was by perseverance alone that we could hope to reap the benefits of what we had accomplished. The last charge to which he would apply himself was that of swindling. The South American States had been accused of defrauding the people of this country; now, there never was a charge more completely destitute of foundation. It was alleged that two and twenty millions had been lost to this country, in consequence of its pecuniary transactions with the States of South America. Now, the fact was, that only sixteen or seventeen millions had been subscribed, and of that only a small portion had ever been paid. Thus, for example, in the case of the Mexican loan, the whole sum was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0721"/>
<col>1427</col>
6,400,000<i>l</i>. of which only 2,458,000<i>l</i>. had actually been sent out of the country. The South American governments had all along shewn every disposition to do what was fair and just. They had, it was true, made a hard bargain for themselves; but, then they said, "this has been made by our authorised agents, we are therefore, bound by it." The reproach to the people of South America, that they had failed in their pecuniary engagements, was one which they shared in common with many of the most distinguished amongst the European states. France had become bankrupt, Austria had been three times a bankrupt; as far as making three several compositions with England could make her so. Even we ourselves had been obliged to suspend cash payments; and, therefore, so far as foreign countries were concerned, we must be regarded in the light of bankrupts. It was not, besides, matter of surprise that those countries should at the present moment find themselves in circumstances of embarrassment, seeing that they were exposed to the contention of rival chiefs, and to the miseries of internal discord; but of this he felt perfectly assured, that whatever might be the opinion entertained of the skill and discretion with which they managed their financial concerns, there could not be the slightest suspicion that they at any time contemplated a fraud as respected the people of this country. He knew that general Bolivar was, at the present moment, doing all in his power to have a portion of the revenues set apart for the purpose of liquidating these debts. This, though it was all that, under present circumstances, could be done, formed no excuse, he was ready to admit, for the past. He did not held the people of South America to have been criminal in their pecuniary transactions, but they were culpable in not corning fairly before their creditors, and declaring their inability to pay. Had they done this, they would have put an end to the speculations of bulls and bears, and have saved the holders of their securities from a great deal of loss and a great deal of misery. He thought also, that the government of this country ought to exert its influence, for the purpose of effecting the payment of such British subjects as were creditors of the South American governments. But though entertaining the feelings which he did, he could not lose sight of the circum-
<col>1428</col>
stances of palliation which attended the situation in which the governments of those states were placed, nor could he forget the part which this country bore in their liberation. He concluded by moving, for an account of the official value of all exports of every denomination of British and Colonial produce, to the States of South America, during the last seven years; also of the imports from the same places.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01298"><member>Mr. C. Grant</member><membercontribution> said, he would very readily accede to the motion, at the same time he feared there might be some difficulty in making out all the returns called for.

<title>FOREIGN TRADE&#x2014;IMPORTS FOR HOME<lb/> CONSUMPTION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01300"><member>Sir Henry Parnell</member><membercontribution> rose for the purpose of moving for several accounts respecting the Foreign Trade of the United Kingdom. The first account was similar to an account that was laid on the table of the House in the last session, on a motion that he had made: it was an account of the importation of a great number of articles of foreign manufactures, and raw materials, in the years 1824 and 1826. These years were taken, because it was in the year 1825 that the customs duties were altered with the professed design of establishing a free trade&#x2014;and therefore, a comparison of the importations of 1824 with those of 1826, would show the practical effect of the alteration of the duties, and of what is called the Free-trade System. The account he now proposed to move for was of the importations of'1824, 1826, and 1827, for the purpose of showing what the effect of the alteration of the duties had been in 1827. The account which was presented last year proved that the prediction which he had made in 1825, of the effect of the new system, was well founded; namely that no considerable increased importation of foreign manufactures would take place, because the new duties had been fixed so high as to be prohibitory duties. In point of fact there was no other progress made in introducing free trade, except the changing a system of absolute prohibition into a system of prohibitory duties. The country, therefore, still suffers all the injury that belongs to a system of restriction and protection. The immediate evil of this system is the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0722"/>
<col>1429</col>
raising of the prices of all goods on which the protecting duties are imposed. Another evil is, that, in proportion as these duties exclude foreign goods, the homemade goods are of inferior quality; but the greatest evil of all is the diminution of foreign trade, which is the result of preventing several millions worth of foreign goods from being imported, and a corresponding quantity of British goods from being exported to pay for them.<lb/>
It was no doubt true that there were great difficulties in the way of removing the system of protection. The right hon. gentleman, the Secretary of the Colonies accomplished a great deal in 1825, and probably all that was then practicable to be done. But, as we now had three years experience of the effects of a more liberal system, and full proof that, in every instance, it had been completely successful, it was now time to make some further progress, and to afford to the industry and capital of the nation new sources for employment. The complete failure of all the anticipations of ruin which were so loudly set forth in 1825 by the silk manufacturers, and glove manufacturers, and other manufacturers ought to serve as an encouragement to ministers to take a decided course, and to act by the public in the way that the true interests of the public required. The supposed partial interests of this or that set of manufacturers ought not to be upheld, by inflicting upon, the great body of consumers a heavy system of taxation by the high prices which the system of protection gave rise to. With respect to France nothing could be more unnatural than the actual state of our trade with that country. There were no two countries so well calculated to deal largely together as these countries were, each had many productions which were peculiar, respectively, to each other. So that a great interchange of commodities might take place without the possibility of any injury to either party, but with the certainty of the greatest benefit. But in place of this the whole imports from France do not amount to two millions, and the whole of the British productions, which are exported to France, is only about 400,000<i>l</i>. Our high duties on French wines were in every respect most impolitic. They certainly produced less revenue than lower rates of duty would produce.&#x2014;In the last session the chancellor of the Exchequer (lord Goderich) told the House
<col>1430</col>
that measures were on foot for having the treaty with Portugal revived, and held out hopes that the duties on French wines would be lowered; but nothing more has been heard on the subject. It was unquestionably a most absurd thing, that this country should be at this day levying a rate of duty on French wines, which was established at a period when national wealth was supposed to consist wholly in gold bullion; and when it was imagined that the best way of attaining it was by levying a lower duty on Portuguese wines than on those of France.&#x2014;The hon. baronet concluded by moving" For accounts of all foreign goods imported in the years 1824, 1826, and 1827; and also for accounts of the principal articles of raw materials, and of general consumption, imported from abroad in each quarter during the last four years." He stated that his object in moving for the last account was to show what the state of the home trade was in each of these years.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN NEW<lb/> SOUTH WALES AND VAN DIEMEN'S LAND.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01304"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> rose to move for leave to bring in a bill "to provide for the Administration of Justice in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. The important colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land were now regulated, in what related to the administration of justice, by an act passed in the year 1821. His object, in the first instance, was to provide for the continuance of certain powers contained in that act, which were about to expire; and, in the next, to provide for future alterations in the administration of justice. From the peculiar situation in which the population of those colonies were placed, about two-thirds of the inhabitants having forfeited their civil rights, it was difficult to have the law administered in the manner which prevailed in this country, by means
<image src="S2V0018P0I0723"/>
<col>1431</col>
of grand and petty juries. It had been found necessary, therefore, to suspend the system pursued' in this country, and provide a jury of a peculiar description, suited to the nature of the population. This suspension of the English system he intended, in the new bill, to continue, but to make provisions that would gradually, should circumstances permit it, assimilate the administration of justice in the colony to that of England. The colonies were not in a situation to admit of thus receiving a legislative assembly, but on the plan pursued with respect to Canada, before it had a legislative assembly, he proposed that they should have a legislative council, to be composed of twelve or fifteen persons, who would be entitled to vote on all matters connected with their expenditure, and, indeed, concerning their affairs generally. This would lead the way in time to the establishment of institutions in those colonies similar to those of the people from whom the inhabitants sprung.</membercontribution></p>

<title>STAMPS ON CARDS AND DICE.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01306">The House resolved itself into a Committee on the Acts regulating the Stamp Duties upon Cards and Dice,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01307"><member>Mr. G. Dawson</member><membercontribution> said, that in submitting certain resolutions to the committee, for the repeal of the duty on cards and dice, he was induced to take that course from a conviction that the duties on those articles were too severe, and gave rise to much fraud in the manufacture and sale of the articles in question. His object would be to repeal the existing acts, with a view to a reduction of the duties. His motives were, a desire to take away the existing temptations to fraud, to simplify the duties, and to prevent, by the proposed reduction, the surreptitious importation of foreign cards, and the sale of home-made second-hand cards in the shops. The present acts on the subject were found insufficient to protect the public revenue or the public morals. The result of the duties was a fraudulent evasion of the law. In the reign of queen Anne, the first duty, 6<i>d</i>. a pack, was imposed on cards. In the reign of George 1st it was increased to 1<i>s</i>.; in George 2nd to 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; in 1792 it was raised to 2<i>s</i>.; and in 1802 to 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
<col>1432</col>
a pack: being 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. on the ace of spades, 6<i>d</i>. on the wrapper, and 6<i>d</i>, on the label. These duties on the wrapper and label were intended to prevent the sale of second-hand cards. But he could see no reason why persons who paid 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a pack on articles whose manufactured value was only 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. should be prevented from selling them again? And his doubts of the justice of these duties were confirmed by the fact, that though they were increased from time to time, the revenue arising from them did not increase in proportion. The revenue was defrauded of the duties by various means: first, by servants selling second-hand cards, which were re-sold as new, without paying duty; then, by a practice among some manufacturers, of getting cards stamped as for exportation, and afterwards selling them in this country duty free, under the cover of that stamp, thus fraudulently obtained. Another way of defrauding the revenue of the duty on cards, was the custom in foreign countries of forging the English stamp, and smuggling them into this country, and selling them at a lower price than the regularly-stamped cards could be sold at. These various frauds lessened the revenue, injured the fair manufacturer of cards, and corrupted the morals of the people. To prevent which, he thought the best plan was to remove the temptations to fraud, by reducing the duty on cards.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01308"><member>Sir J. Newport</member><membercontribution> had no objection to the measure proposed, though he could not help thinking that while the enormous duties on fire insurance existed, the article of cards was an odd one to make the subject of an experiment in the way of a modification of duties; nor could he see how an encouragement to a more general use of cards was calculated to protect the morals of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01309"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> hailed the measure as a sign of the approaching prevalence of sound principles. As to the effect of this repeal of duties on the public morals, would it not remove the temptations to smuggling and forging? The measure was an excellent one, and he hoped to see the government extending the principle of it to other articles that were subject to high duties. He had no doubt there were establishments all along the coast opposite England, for the express manufacture of every article that was subject to high duty in this country. But those foreign manufacturers ere not to be blamed, but the govern-

<title>CONTROVERTED ELECTION LAWS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01311"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, that, in rising to move for leave to bring in a bill to consolidate and amend the laws on the subject of Controverted Elections, he felt it necessary to offer a few observations. The House knew, that it was now fifty-eight years since a Select Committee had been appointed to inquire into those laws, and that since that period ten acts of parliament had been passed on the subject. It was his wish to consolidate all these acts into one. He had prepared the bill, and would state shortly to the House the material alterations which it was the object of that bill to make in the present laws. In the first place, great difficulty and inconvenience had arisen from that part of the law which rendered it necessary that, on the presentment of petitions, the parties should enter into two recognizances; the one, to prosecute the petition, and the other to defray the expenses of its prosecution. It was clear that only one of; these could be necessary; and it was his wish therefore to remove the other. It repeatedly happened under the present laws, that the very clay before the trial of a controverted election was to come on, when the petitioning party had made all the necessary preparations, summoned his witnesses, and brought them to town at a considerable expense, the sitting member declined I to defend his seat. Hence arose a new delay of thirty days, and the witnesses were sent back to the country. It was his intention to give the sitting member fourteen days to decide whether he would defend his seat; and in the event of his; not declaring his intention within fourteen; days after the presentment of the petition, to make him liable for the costs that might have been incurred. He did not think that this, which was merely an act of justice to the petitioner, could be considered as any hardship upon the sitting member. Another reason why this alteration ought to be made was, that supposing the contents of the petition to be substantiated, the sitting member was completely out of court, and a person re-
<col>1434</col>
turned who might have no legal claim. He therefore proposed, in order to remedy this defect, that in all cases any persons claiming the right of voting should be admitted as collateral parties. He had heard of bargains being made on this subject, and compromises entered into. A committee, too, of last session&#x2014;of which he had no wish to speak but in terms of respect&#x2014;had thought themselves justified, without hearing a syllable of evidence, to seat the petitioner, because the sitting member said he would not defend his seat. It was necessary that compromises between the sitting member and the petitioner, and this consequence of the sitting member refusing to defend, should be both prevented.&#x2014;He now came to the mode in which these committees were appointed. The House was aware that at present the number of names directed to be struck was forty-nine. He thought it quite unnecessary that so large a number should be struck, in the first instance. His intention was to assimilate these committees as much as possible to the nature of juries. Looking at the original bill, he found that it gave the power of striking off the names of members on cause being assigned; but, the House had found the exercise of this power to be most invidious. It seemed to him that it would be sufficient to draw only three times as many names, in the first instance, as would be required, and from them to strike off only a complete jury. He thought that the number of which these committees were at present composed might be reduced from fifteen to eleven, to be selected from the thirty-three names which he assumed to be sufficient to be struck in the first instance.&#x2014;As to the I matter of nominees, he had reason to think that the House did not originally intend that they should be as they now were. It was well known that hon. members upon being appointed nominees had; enlisted themselves among the contending parties. He regretted to say that this had happened in many instances. The argument urged in favour of the appointment of nominees was, that the responsible situation in which they were placed would make them most scrupulous of being biassed, especially when they acted under oath. He regretted, however, to say that this was not the case. He had consulted several professional gentlemen who had been concerned on these occasions, and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0725"/>
<col>1435</col>
from them he had learned, that it was the practice, not only for the nominees to go up stairs and advise respecting striking out the names, but even to attend consultations; and that these judges, therefore, had actually made themselves parties in the dispute. He did not mean to cast any imputations on individuals, but he was sure there was no hon. gentleman who would not see how inconvenient it was to persist in the present course. In his opinion, it would be better to do away with nominees altogether. Gentlemen were now better informed on these subjects than they were sixty years ago, and the different reports which had been presented to the House had turned men's minds more seriously to the law on this subject. The only course which could be substituted for the present would be to give the committee the power of electing the nominees. But even this course was subject to objection, and he thought the better way would be to do away with them altogether. These were the principal alterations which it was his wish to make. His bill included all the acts upon the subjects, with the exception of that of 1803, which regulated the examination of witnesses. He thought that had better remain as an object of separate attention. He saw many inconveniences in the present practice, but he confessed that he could suggest no remedy for them. He had, therefore, left that act to be altered as the House should think fit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01312"><member>Mr. Croker</member><membercontribution> agreed in all that had fallen from the right hon. gentleman. He wished to say a word or two on the question of nominees. When the Irish parliament adopted the acts of the English parliament on this subject, they left out the part respecting nominees, and never found that the omission of it caused any difficulty, either from want of information or want of justice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01313"><member>Sir J. Macintosh</member><membercontribution> said, he never was in a more unpleasant situation in his life, than when he had been appointed a nominee. He would throw out, as a suggestion to the right hon. gentleman, whether a convenient substitute for nominees might not be found by resolving, that the committee should choose a chairman, not from among themselves, but from the body of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01314"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> entirely concurred in what had fallen from the right hon. mover. In the course of his parliamentary life, he
<col>1436</col>
had often thought of the propriety of abolishing nominees; and what they had just heard with respect to Ireland confirmed his notions on this subject. He was glad to find the conduct of this business in such able hands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01315"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> agreed, that the time was come when these laws ought to be consolidated, and thought the House was under great obligations to his right hon. friend. He was sure that great advantage would result from the measure. The constitution of committees ought to be altered with respect to nominees; and he thought eleven members quite enough for a committee. Besides, it might be necessary that many committees should be appointed, and therefore the more the number of persons in each committee was reduced, the greater provision there would be for committees. At the same time, the loss of the nominees ought to be compensated for by some other means, in order that ability and experience might be ensured to each committee. He thought great inconvenience would result, if the committee was allowed to select a chairman from the body of the House. He wished to suggest to his right hon. friend, whether some person might not be appointed by way of assessor. All he was afraid of was, that if there were only to be thirty-three names, with the power of striking off twenty-two, committees would be appointed which, from their inexperience, would not obtain the confidence of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01316"><member>Sir J. Macintosh</member><membercontribution> said, his suggestion was, that it should be made imperative on the committee to select a chairman from the body of the House. This would do away with the reflection which the right hon. gentleman had alluded to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01317"><member>Sir G. Warrender</member><membercontribution> thought there ought to be an assessor appointed. A committee of which he was a member had actually overturned a decision of the Court of Session; which decision was afterwards confirmed by the House of Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01318"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> agreed that nominees ought to be abolished. He had often been a nominee, but he would not plead guilty to all that had been said against them. He did not like the proposition of an assessor. He thought the suggestion of making it imperative on committees to select a chairman from the body of the House was a very proper one. The House and the country would, he was
<image src="S2V0018P0I0726"/>
<col>1437</col>
sure, be obliged to the right bon. gentleman for bringing this matter forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01319"><member>Dr. Phillimore</member><membercontribution> said, he had served as a nominee on the committee to which his hon. friend (sir G. Warrender) had alluded; and so far from that committee having' violated the law, he was sure that its decision was founded on the soundest principles of law. He agreed that nominees ought to be abolished; and thought that if a committee had the benefit of two expert counsel, they would seldom decide wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01320"><member>Mr. S. Rice</member><membercontribution> thought the constitution of election committees bad. It was bad that their proceedings should be conducted with closed doors. Whatever the strict rule of the House might be, no gentleman would say, that the two Houses of parliament could perform their functions with effect, unless the public were made acquainted with their conduct, and the reasons and principles on which they decided upon public questions. But in a committee up stairs every thing was decided irrevocably, and in the dark; and though it was known what decision they had come to, the reasons of that decision were concealed. He would state one curious fact. A petition had been presented against the return of his hon. friend (Mr. Hume); but there was not the shadow of a case made out on the part of the petitioner, and it was therefore voted unanimously, that the hon. member should not be called upon for a defence: but, when the question that the hon. member should retain his seat came to be decided, four of the committee who had so voted unanimously, voted also, that he should not retain his seat. What possible reason could have actuated these four, it was not for him to divine; but he was sure that no such thing could have occurred if the doors had been open.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01321"><member>Mr. R. Colborne</member><membercontribution> thought if the hon. member's plan were adopted, that a little debate would be got up upon every question, however unimportant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01322"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> said, that though long speeches might be an inconvenience, the benefit which would result from the doors being open ought not to be left, out of the consideration. Publicity was the true corrective for the evil.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01323"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> thought that every committee should have a person of knowledge and experience to counsel and advise them. A committee,
<col>1438</col>
of which he had been a member, had decided on a point of evidence, twice one way, and once a contrary way.</membercontribution></p>

<title>GREEKS&#x2014;SLAVES FROM THE MOREA.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01325"><member>Sir R. Wilson</member><membercontribution> said, he felt it his duty to address the House on a subject which deeply concerned, not only the interests of humanity, but the national faith. Official advice had now been received, that&#x2014;he had heard even seven thousand persons, but certainly&#x2014;several thousand persons, men, women, and children, had been forcibly taken from the Morea, put on board the Egyptian fleet, and landed at Alexandria, where they had been publicly sold as slaves. The sufferings of these unhappy persons had been highly aggravated, from their having been torn from their country at a moment when the blessings of freedom had just begun to dawn upon it. The right hon. Secretary had, on a former occasion stated, that orders had been issued that none of the non-combatting part of the Greek population should be removed. He would ask then, how it was possible, while such orders existed, that the Egyptian fleet, or rather that remnant of a fleet which had escaped the battle of Navarino, should have been allowed to commit this piracy; for, to tear women and children from their homes and consign them to slavery was the worst of piracy? He wished to ask the right hon. gentleman, whether any official advices had arrived in this country which explained this transaction? He wished, also, to ask the right hon. gentleman whether any measures had been taken by this country, by itself, or in conjunction with its allies, to redeem these unfortunate persons from their bondage? This reparation, at least, was due to Greece, which had a right, under the treaty of the 6th of July, to claim the protection of the allied powers from wrongs like these, and all the relief that could be afforded them when the infliction of such wrongs had been allowed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01326"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he had already stated, that in 1825, and consequently long before the protocol was signed by the duke of Wellington at Petersburgh, and long before the treaty of the 6th of July, his majesty's ministers had received an indistinct intimation, that the commander of the Egyptian forces intended to take away the inhabitants of the Morea to serve in Egypt; and before the treaty
<image src="S2V0018P0I0727"/>
<col>1439</col>
of the 6th of July was entered into, a distinct and formal intimation was given to Ibrahim Pacha, that his majesty would never agree to such an exercise of the rights of war, or allow the inhabitants of the Morea to be converted into slaves by force. No attempt was at that time made by Ibrahim to put this intention into practice, and it was not therefore necessary then to take any measures of prevention. He believed it was correct that some women and children had been taken forcibly from the Morea since the battle of Navarino. Instructions had been given to the British admiral before the battle took place, and those instructions were consequently still in force; by which the British fleet was directed to prevent any movement whatever of the Egyptian force, with this exception only,&#x2014;that if any attempt were made to remove the Egyptian army from the Morea every facility should be afforded for the execution of such an attempt; but it was perfectly understood, that the Egyptian forces only were to be removed, and that any attempt at removing any portion of the population of the Morea was to be resisted. On the 28th of December, a fleet, consisting of forty-five sail, arrived at Alexandria. This fleet was the remnant of that which had been engaged in the action at Navarino. These vessels had on board the disabled seamen and soldiers, and also some women and children, but what the number of them was he could not tell. He had seen an account which rested upon tolerable authority, and that account stated that the number did not exceed six hundred. For the rest, he could assure the hon. member, that the subject was one to which ministers had given their best attention. Immediately upon the arrival of the intelligence in this country, instructions had been sent out to the British admiral; and in a very short time he had little doubt of being able to enter into full explanations without any prejudice to the public service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01327"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> thought that the honour of the country, no less than the interests of humanity, was implicated in the question; but he was bound to admit, that the observations of the right hon. gentleman were so far satisfactory, that they displayed no want of proper feeling upon the subject. At the same time, he rejoiced that the question which called forth those observations had been asked; and trusted that
<col>1440</col>
proper steps would be taken to restore those unhappy people who had been carried away into slavery to the home from which they had been so atrociously removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01328"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> said, that in 1825 a project had been conceived by Ibrahim Pacha, of carrying off the whole population of the Morea into slavery in Egypt, and re-peopling the country with Arabs. As soon as that intention had been known at St. Petersburgh, a declaration of the strongest character had been issued, stating that the first attempt to execute it would be held to justify the most decided measures on the part of the powers of Europe for its prevention. The abominable outrage by which so many unoffending women and children had been carried into captivity, seemed to be a sort of remains of the project of 1825; and merited the promptest notice by this country. He could not doubt that the inquiry, in which the government was engaged, referred to the most convenient measures for restoring the unhappy victims to their country, and he trusted that every effort would be made, not only to disclaim any acquiescence in such an act on the part of England, but to repair, as far as possible, the consequences of it. With respect to the great general question connected with this subject, he should at present abstain as far as possible from making any comments on it, although it was a topic upon which he and those who thought with him observed silence with difficulty; and how much longer it would be possible for them to persevere in a silence which cost them so great an effort, and which might be liable to misconstruction, it was impossible for him to say. It was a little extraordinary, that, while the other powers, which were parties to the Treaty of London, had declared their intentions plainly, England alone should refuse to speak out. In, France, the full explanation of M. Peyronnet, left no question as to what the policy of that country would be. Russia, in a communication which was substantially official, had avowed to all the world the motives of her policy, and she was at that very moment probably on the eve of executing it. Even the Turks themselves had made known the whole course of fraud and delusion which they had been practising upon all the powers of Europe for a series of years. Under these circumstances, he would, shortly after the recess,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0728"/>
<col>1441</col>
call the attention of the House to the situation and duties of this country under the treaty of the 6th of July. The more he reflected upon the treaty in question, the more firmly he was convinced of its justice, lawfulness, and wisdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01329"><member>Mr. Bright</member><membercontribution> said, he had never been convinced of the wisdom of the treaty upon which the learned gentleman had laid so much stress. He called upon ministers rather to revise their course of policy, than allow their feelings to hurry them into a war.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01330"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, there was one point of the speech of the learned member for Knaresborough upon which he must observe, lest he should be supposed to acquiesce in it. The learned member said, that he presumed the "inquiry," of which he (Mr. Peel), in a former address to the House, had spoken, could be nothing else than an inquiry into the best mode of restoring that part of the population recently carried from the Morea to their country. Now, he was not aware that it was possible entirely to go that length. Undoubtedly, if the instructions of government had been strictly complied with, the transportation of those persons would have been prevented. No blame was to be attached to the conduct of our fleet, the physical powers and means of which had been cramped by the battle of Navarino: but the orders, if it had been possible to have executed them fully, were to prevent any movement of the hostile fleet, unless one which should be sanctioned by the English admiral, and of which the object should be to transport the Egyptian forces employed in the Morea back to their own country. As the intelligence at present stood the extent of the spoliation that had been committed was uncertain. Unfortunately, too, those slaves had been landed in Egypt, and sold in the public market. If the ships which contained them had been taken at sea, there could have been no difficulty about their disposal; but now they were probably divided, and the property of private individuals. At present he would go no further than to repeat, that within forty-eight hours after the arrival of the news, the most active inquiry had been entered upon by government, as to all the facts connected with the case. Sufficient information had not yet been received; but the investigation was going on.</membercontribution></p>

<title>OFFENCES AGAINST THE PERSON BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01337"><member>The Marquis of Lansdowne</member> moved the order of the day for the third reading of the bill to consolidate the laws respecting Offences against the Person.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01338"><member>Earl Grey</member><membercontribution> said, he had no objection to the passing of the bill, but he rose to object to one of its clauses. Their lordships would find in the clause directing the punishment for the crime of murder, the usual punishment of the dissection of the criminal's body was omitted, and power was given to the judge of ordering the criminal to be hung in chains. He was certainly not one of those who on common occasions contended for severity of punishment. It had, indeed, been remarked, that the law of this country was much too sanguinary. The punishment of death was unhappily extended to many offences of an inferior nature to the crime of murder; and the distinction made by dissecting the murderer's body appeared to him to give an additional terror against
<image src="S2V0018P0I0729"/>
<col>1443</col>
the commission of that greatest offence next to treason, and it was for the interest of the community that the distinction which had hitherto prevailed between that and minor offences should be kept up. That no effect would be produced on the individual murderer, who had made up his mind to the completion of the horrible crime, by the punishment and the consequences which would follow the act, he must perhaps, admit; but still the additional punishment of dissection had operated, by a salutary terror on the community, to keen up that horror of the crime of murder for which the English people had hitherto been distinguished. The ground on which the alteration in the law was now proposed was, according to the statements of the petitions which had been presented to their lordships, the great difficulty which existed in procuring subjects for dissection, by which the science of surgery was impeded, to the great detriment of the community, whose interest it was to have surgeons properly educated. He believed that that difficulty was complained of with some foundation, but he was of opinion, that that difficulty was not likely to be diminished by public discussion in their lordships' House. That difficulty was, however, the ground upon which the clause had been introduced; because it was presumed, that the dissecting the body of the criminal had the effect of a stigma, or acted as an aggravation of punishment on the feelings of society, which increased the dislike in people to give up the bodies of their relations for dissection after death. That might be the case; but their lordships would see that it was purely theoretical and speculative, and that there was great doubt whether it was founded in truth; and if theory and speculation were put in the balance, in contradistinction to established fact, the one could not be considered in any degree of comparison with the other. He did, therefore, wish their lordships to reconsider the clause, and alter it; and if that were the opinion of their lordships, he should suggest, that they leave the punishment of murder as it now stood by law. About thirty years ago, a bill of a very different character was introduced in the other House of Parliament, which went to extend the punishment of dissection after death to burglaries and highway robberies. He remembered that that bill was most ably and eloquently opposed by
<col>1444</col>
Mr. Serjeant Adair, who stated, that it was of importance to confine that aggravation of punishment to the crime of murder; because it had the salutary effect of increasing that general terror which existed in this country against that species of crime. On these grounds he opposed the extension of the punishment of dissection to other crimes than murder. And, as the converse of that position, he thought it not expedient to continue the clause as it stood, which removed almost the only distinction which existed between the punishments of the most aggravated and the minor offences, to which the punishment of death was unhappily affixed. Hanging the murderer in chains, as provided by the present bill, would not operate in the same salutary way on the minds of the people. He had thought it his duty to submit his doubts to their lordships, and to suggest the expunging of that part of the clause which took away the punishment of dissection, on grounds theoretical and speculative.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01339"><member>Lord Tenterden</member><membercontribution> concurred in the sentiments expressed by the noble earl. When the bill was committed a first time, the noble marquis proposed the alteration in the law now alluded to. It was then understood, that he had no objection to the clause, though he desired another opportunity for further consideration on the subject, when the bill should be recommitted. Upon that occasion he happened not to be present, and had lost the opportunity of expressing his opinion. If it were not now too late to make an amendment, he should be desirous that the clause should be restored to its original shape. The object of omitting the punishment from the bill was, because it attached a stigma to the practice of dissection, which, if done away with, would give greater facility for a supply of subjects, and thereby promote the science of surgery. Whether that would be the case he had great doubt; and when it was a matter of doubt, he should be unwilling that any alteration should be made in the law as it now stood, which law he hoped would serve as an additional terror to induce persons, if any thing could induce them, from the commission of that most horrible of crimes. He perfectly agreed in what the noble earl had said, that when a man had made up his mind to the commission of murder, no consideration of the punishment could divert him from it; but
<image src="S2V0018P0I0730"/>
<col>1445</col>
he thought that when the first idea arose in the mind of the commission of that unlawful act, it might be checked, from a consideration of the disgraceful punishment of dissection; and if such a circumstance were only to take place once in twenty years, the law would have proved beneficial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01340"><member>The Marquis of Lansdowne</member><membercontribution> said, that the ground on which the punishment of dissection was omitted in the clause, was the statement of persons in the surgical profession, who represented that they would rather remain without the assistance of that small supply of bodies which the law afforded them, if by that means a stigma would be removed, by which removal they hoped to obtain a sufficient number of bodies for purposes of science, without being obliged to make use of a system, which had the effect of exciting crime in another direction: he alluded to the practice of body-snatchers, a practice which placed men in a situation, by which they were gradually led on to the commission of other crimes. So long as the present law afforded the only supply of bodies for surgeons, a road would be kept continually open to crime. As long as the supply of subjects was inadequate to the purposes of instruction, the medical student would be driven out of this country to complete his education. It could not, however, be an idle theory, that condemning the murderer to be dissected operated to prevent people from giving their bodies, after death, for the same purpose. As long as it was thought necessary to preserve this distinction between murder and other crimes, by adding dissection to death, so long would innocent persons have an abhorrence to submit to what was regarded as a great punishment. No persons would voluntarily expose themselves or their friends to that which was inflicted on murderers; though it was of great importance to science that persons should, after death, be dissected. He would not, however, persevere; and it was yet quite time for his noble friend to move his amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TURNPIKE TRUSTS BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01342"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> said, he rose to submit to the House
<col>1446</col>
the Resolutions, of which he had given notice, on this subject. He had brought forward Resolutions last year with a similar object; namely, that of relieving the parties from the heavy fees and charges now imposed on the renewal of Turnpike Trust acts. He would briefly state the grounds on which he felt himself entitled to call on the House to agree to the abolition of these fees and charges. He did not share the opinion of those gentlemen who held that fees on private bills should be altogether abolished. He believed that fees were generally advantageous to the public; as he was certain that in many cases they were necessary to protect property, and prevent the undue consumption of the time of that House. But he would not agree to continue the fees on the renewal of Turnpike Trust-bills. It had already been the subject of discussion in two select committees. The latter of these had been appointed at his own instance, the session before the last; and he could not express himself so concisely as in the terms of the first paragraph of their Report [The hon. gentleman then read the passage]. The committee appointed in 1821, on the motion of his hon. friend (sir Davies Gilbert), to inquire generally into the fees taken on private bills, agreed to recommend the abolition of fees on the renewal of Turnpike-bills, though in every other case they considered the retention of the fees a matter of public importance. The recommendation of this committee had, however, not been carried into effect, and the heavy fees to which Turnpike-bills were subject were still exacted. Those fees were double what were required in other instances, such, for example, as a Naturalization-bill, and were, in many cases, raised to treble the amount of the private bills; indeed they were sometimes increased to an indefinite extent. The charges had been so excessive, that they had been matter of complaint throughout the country. The present system of fees could not go on without some change. The whole mortgage debt of the Turnpike trusts in England, within the last two or three years, was 4,474,530<i>l.,</i> and the interest overdue amounted to 500,581<i>l.</i> In Wales, the debt was 238,168<i>l.,</i> and the interest 34,078<i>l.</i> In Scotland, the debt was 1,327,946<i>l.,</i> and the interest 263,975<i>l.,</i> making altogether a total of 6,839,278<i>l.</i> This was independent of the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0731"/>
<col>1447</col>
great annual charge for making and repairing roads throughout the United Kingdom. The question before the House was, whether, under these circumstances, they ought not to make less frequent and less onerous, the necessity of applying to parliament for the renewal of these trusts. He had received a variety of communications, as to the grievance of fees on the renewal of Turnpike trusts. He found that, in many instances, the trusts were breaking down under the weight of their debts. In England, Wales, and Scotland, the whole receipts of the trusts for two years would be insufficient to meet the expense of their renewal, if it recurred, as now, once in every seventeen years. This charge could only be adequately met by increasing the tolls. The ordinary amount of fees on a Turnpike-bill was about 148<i>l.,</i> of which 83<i>l.</i> were exacted in that House, and 65<i>l.</i> in the House of Lords. The average amount of the items in fifteen bills of costs, for soliciting Turnpike-bills by Mr. Dorington, in 1826, was in the House of Commons 94<i>l.</i> and in the House of Lords 64<i>l.</i> The average cost of printing was 26<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>; and the whole charge in both Houses amounted, on the average, to 184<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> But these bills were all of the most favourable description in point of cost. In a letter he had received from Devonshire, a gentleman stated that he had solicited three bills on which he had paid fees to the amount respectively of 278<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.,</i> 280<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.,</i> and 273<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> It was unnecessary to detain the House longer with statements of this kind, which, he was aware, were open to the answer, that the expense was caused by the including of a great many districts, and by the separate application of the funds. But he would refer to one case among the poorer counties&#x2014;that of Glamorganshire, where the whole expenses had been more than 1,000<i>l.</i> He knew there was a great variety of trusts in this case, but he knew also that this county was very poor, and the charge he considered as excessive. The receipt of a small trust, in the neighbourhood of London, was frequently greater than the whole receipts of such a county as Glamorgan. The remedy he proposed was stated in the resolutions he intended to move. The first resolution was, "That after the present session of parliament, all bills, which, among other matters, should be for the renewal, or repeal and renewal
<col>1448</col>
of Turnpike trusts, should be exempted from the payment of all fees now chargeable according to the table of fees of that House." This measure would be advantageous to the trustees of the Turnpike roads, not only to the extent of the fees saved, but in another material respects The very existence of those fees rendered it necessary for the parties to attend twice before the House. Otherwise, as in the case of Inclosure bills, the opposing party might turn round upon them and say, they had not complied with the Standing Orders of the House, by not attending in the first instance. But if the House relieved them from the payment of fees, there would be no reason why the attendance of the Solicitor and witnesses should not be dispensed with altogether on the petition. This alone would be a great saving, where the parties, came from distant places. The second resolution accordingly stated, that committees on the petition should be dispensed with, and the parties bound to give their attendance only on the committee on the bill. By this arrangement these bills would be reduced to the same conduct as public acts. By the next resolution, for the future, the expense of engrossing and printing these bills would be borne by the public; but if, in any instance, the Standing Orders were not complied with, the expense should be charged to the parties. He was aware that, under colour of these resolutions, parties might be induced sometimes to make extensive alterations of the line of the road. He proposed to meet this objection by a provision, by which these bills would be confined to a limited extent, while ample scope would be allowed for improvement. The last resolution went to extend the usual term of twenty-one years to the term of thirty-one years; the result of which would be, the saving of one half of the expense of these bills. If the House could be induced to adopt this resolution, the total saving would, on an average, including the abolition of fees amount to 234<i>l.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01343"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that with respect to the question of fees generally, he would only remark, that the propositions of his hon. friend applied to the principle on which fees were taken on all private matters brought before that House, and he thought it would be well for the House, before it acquiesced in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0732"/>
<col>1449</col>
these resolutions, to consider what effect they would have on the other branches of private business that came before it. Those fees were appropriated to public objects, by acts of parliament, and if these resolutions had the effect of reducing the amount of the fund so raised, it would be incumbent on the House to provide other means to defray the expenses heretofore paid out of this fund. He was inclined to say, that where the bill was merely to renew a trust about to expire, that would be a fair case for consideration; and, if he did not mistake, by a resolution of the House, bills to renew expiring trusts were already subject only to the lowest class of fees.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01344"><member>Sir C. Burrell</member><membercontribution> approved of the principle of the resolutions, and quoted an instance where a very important road in the western part of Sussex was obliged to be neglected, in consequence of the great expense that would be incurred in procuring a bill to alter the provisions of the act now in being.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01345"><member>Sir T. Lethbridge</member><membercontribution> expressed his approbation of the resolutions. It appeared to him that Turnpike-bills, though treated as private bills, were, in fact, bills of a public nature.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01346"><member>Mr. R. Gordon</member><membercontribution> said, it was exceedingly unfair, that any portion of the expense attendant on the furtherance of public business should be defrayed out of fees paid by private individuals. The House was not perhaps aware, that there was no charge for engrossing public bills; the whole expense was charged on private bills. Why such a system should be adopted he knew not. Certainly it was very unjust.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01347"><member>Mr. H. Drummond</member><membercontribution> complained that the existing system pressed very heavily on Scotland. In some instances the whole income of a Turnpike trust was swallowed up in procuring the renewal of a bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01348"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> could not see how any resolutions of that House could effect the object contemplated by the hon. member for Staffordshire; since the fees complained of might, and most probably would, still be exacted in the other House.

<p id="S2V0018P0-01349"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> could not conceive, even if the Lords did not choose to give up those fees, why the Commons should abstain from taking a step that would be satisfactory to the country. It was very probable, if the Commons agreed to the

<title>CORPORATION AND TEST ACTS REPEAL<lb/> BILL.]</title><p id="S2V0018P0-01351"><member>Lord Holland</member> moved, that the 13th Charles 2nd, and 25th Charles 2nd, and 16th George 2nd (all referred to in the preamble of the Bill of Repeal), should be read at the table. After this,</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01352"><member>Lord Holland</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke to the following effect:&#x2014;<lb/>
I have now, my lords, to propose the second reading of that bill which, as I observed when it went through its first stage, is anxiously expected by large, loyal, and respectable, classes of the community; a bill solicited by numerous petitions to both Houses of Parliament, amounting, exclusive of those laid upon the table this day, to not less than eight hundred and sixty-one; a bill, which has been brought up from the Commons of the United Kingdom, and recommended to your adoption in. the shape in which it now stands by a vote of that branch of the legislature nearly unanimous<lb/>
Your lordships well know, that, if you give this measure a second reading you sanction its principle; in other words, you thereby express your conviction, that it is just, expedient, or necessary, and perhaps all, to abrogate the Sacramental Test as a qualification for civil and temporal office, and to substitute for it, a plain and simple declaration, that the powers conferred by such office, shall not be employed to weaken, injure, or disturb, the church established by law. Such is the principle of the bill, and although this measure, or measures of this nature, were, during the last century, frequently proposed in another place, and even more frequently agitated and discussed in pamphlets, public meetings, and, I believe, I may add pulpits; yet the principle was never distinctly brought under the consideration of this House of Parliament since the period when our great deliverer, William the 3rd, recommended the adoption of the very measure now proposed in some memorable words,<sup>*</sup> to which I shall probably have
<quote><sup>*</sup> "I am, with all the expedition I can, filling up the vacancies that are in offices and</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0733"/>
<col>1451</col>
occasion to advert in the course of these proceedings. It is indeed well known, that another illustrious prince, George the 1st, at the period of his accession, was, as well as his ministers, anxious to introduce some measure of this description, and a clause for the purpose was actually proposed to be inserted in <i>"A Bill for strengthening the Protestant Succession."</i> The bill passed into a law; the clause was proposed by earl Stanhope, then Secretary of State<lb/>
That clause would, I believe, have accomplished the object, but in a way at once so indirect and unusual, not to say ludicrous, that it can excite no wonder that it was rejected by your lordships' ancestors<lb/>
With that exception, no such proposal has been made to this House since the period of the Revolution; and I think it a fortunate and auspicious circumstance, that, up to the time at which I am speaking, no opinion directly hostile to the measure I recommend, has ever been expressed by a British House of Lords. Here, then, is a bill, which, after having glided smoothly through all those perilous passes which proved so fatal to its predecessors, has safely arrived at this
<quote>"Region mild of calm and serene air,"<sup>*</sup></quote>
where, until this day, not a breath of adverse wind has blown upon it,
<quote>&#x2014;" semperque innubilus &#x00E6;ther</quote>
<quote>"Integit et large diffuso lumine ridet."&#x2020;</quote>
My lords, I hail the omen; I consider it auspicious, both as to place, and as to season&#x2014;as to place, for the reason I have stated; as to season, because there is no cloud in the political horizon, no factions in the state, no schism, no controversy in the church, to intercept or molest its progress; all this is auspicious indeed of success, and not of success only, but of benefits likely to result from that success, when it shall fortunately be obtained. Happy indeed will it be for this House, creditable to this parliament, and glorious to the
<quote>places of trust by this Revolution. I know you are sensible there is a necessity of some law to settle the Oaths to be taken by all persons to be admitted to such places. I recommend it to your cave to make a speedy provision for it; and, as I doubt not but you will sufficiently provide against Papists, <i>so I hope you will leave room for the admission of all Protestants that are willing and able to serve."</i>&#x2014;</quote>

<col>1452</col>
reign in which we live, if future historians shall have to record, that an Act of Mercy, which alike broke asunder the chains of the Crown, and the fetters of the people, was as obviously and undeniably the result of deliberate wisdom and dispassionate justice, as the laws imposing those chains and fetters had been obviously and undeniably the offspring of precipitation, fear, suspicion, and alarm.<lb/>
I am well aware that an important duty devolves upon the individual who proposes for adoption a measure with such an object; that in order to give to it its due character of deliberation and solemnity, he is called upon, to state at full length and with all possible clearness, the nature, history, and operation of the laws he proposes to repeal. I proceed to that undertaking, not altogether calm and confident, but yet, I trust, undismayed; though I cannot but reflect upon the intricacy of the subject, and the difficulties that surround the origin of these statutes, passed in one of the most interesting, but complicated, periods of our history. When I recollect that the state of the law is involved in many technicalities and perplexities, I fear I have been rash (though I can assure your lordships, not unsolicited by others) in stepping forward to engage in a task much above my powers, and, in some respects, inconsistent with pursuits, so entirely unprofessional as mine. Your lordships, therefore, must forgive me if, from anxiety to be clear, I should unfortunately deviate into prolixity&#x2014;but enough of this. Instead of detaining you with idle apologies and excuses about myself, producing the very evil I deprecate, I will now proceed to call your lordships' attention to the statutes themselves. It was with that view I moved that the Corporation and Test acts should be read, and requested the gentlemen in attendance to lay several others on the table, which, though not touched by the bill now under consideration, are necessary, or at least useful, in illustrating the state and operation of the law; I did so in the hope that, should I fail in correctly explaining myself, your lordships might collect my meaning by a ready reference to the acts; and that, should I be mistaken or incorrect in my views of them, your lordships should have every opportunity of rectifying my mistakes.<lb/>
The Sacramental Test rests upon two statutes of the reign of Charles 2nd,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0734"/>
<col>1453</col>
commonly known by the names of the Corporation act and the Test act, which resemble each other in two particulars; they both require, that a person elected or appointed to office, should receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, according to the rites of the Church of England, and they were both passed in the reign of Charles 2nd. In every other respect, they form a contrast, not a parallel. It is scarcely possible to point out two statutes passed at any period of our history more dissimilar or even opposite in their origin and intentions. The Corporation act, as it is called, was introduced into the other House without being accompanied by any Test of the sort. It was brought in with other designs, for the purpose of expelling immediately from the then existing corporations, persons who before that date had taken an active and an offensive part in the recent troubles and were obnoxious to the government then lately restored. It was a temporary, I may say a party, measure, struck out at the heat of the moment, to gratify, animate, and strengthen, the triumphant&#x2014;begotten in the hey-day of zeal and loyalty, and partaking somewhat both of servility to the Crown, and of violence to those who were the objects of its resentment; a resentment which was, perhaps, naturally to be expected and even excused at such a period. In its object, tendency, and provisions, it was at first merely temporary. As it is, great part of it has expired, and all the rest of it has been repealed except<sup>*</sup> this very Sacramental Test we are now considering. I believe, however, it will be the shortest, and certainly the clearest, way for me to state what were the provisions of the Corporation act, which have expired or have been repealed. Its object being to expel from corporations Presbyterians and others then in actual possession; one declaration and one oath were for that purpose devised; the first to disclaim the "Solemn League and Covenant," the other to express abhorrence of the doctrine, that it is lawful to take up arms under the king's authority against his person. The penalty annexed to the omission of signing this declaration, or taking this oath, was very unlike that of the Test act. It was merely a loss of the office, nothing else. In the
<quote><sup>*</sup> His lordship should have included in this exception the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy which are still required by 13 Chas. 2nd.</quote>
<col>1454</col>
third place, a commission was appointed to administer the oath to the then members of all the corporations in England, and to; expel such as would not take the oath prescribed, it was imperative upon them to do so, but they had, moreover, the power of expelling such <i>as did</i> comply with the act, and take the oath and declaration; in short, they were, in fact, empowered to expel whom they chose, and they were no doubt expected, if not instructed, to expel all whom they thought adverse to the court. This commission was only to last two years; and in this shape the bill was originally framed. It was brought up to this House; a proposition was here made to make the commission permanent; that proposition was resisted by the Commons, but though finally rejected, a compromise seems to have been resorted to, and in the course of it the Sacramental Test for the first time introduced. But here we must define what the nature of that provision and what the Sacramental Test actually was.<lb/>
Your lordships may be surprised to hear, that, although the clause obliging every member of a corporation, to take the Sacrament according to the rites and usages practised in the Church of England, sounds like the clause in the subsequent law called the Test act, yet it neither meant at the time, nor could mean at the time, any such thing. In the first place, two years were to elapse before the clause was to have any effect, and we must first ask, for the understanding of the words, what was the state of the country and of the church at the time of the enactment. Why&#x0021; the benefices, the livings of the church, were three to one, aye, perhaps four out of five, in the hands of the Presbyterians. No act of uniformity had passed, so that to say, according to the <i>"Rites and Usages of the Church of England as now practised,"</i> was in truth to say nothing, for it was a matter of question between two parties how they should then be practised. Nay, more strong hopes were held out to the Presbyterians, that their rites and usages would continue part of the rites and usages of the Church of England, that is to say, of the church in possession. It is idle therefore to assert, that the meaning of the Sacramental Test at that time could be to exclude Presbyterians or Protestant Dissenters from Corporations. I may be asked, "what was the meaning?" I confess the subject is involved in some ob-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0735"/>
<col>1455</col>
scurity. The conjecture I am about to hazard may not be actually proved by history, but yet, whatever might be the intention of the clause, I confidently assert, that it was not, and could not be, to prevent Protestant Dissenters from being or becoming members of corporations, and that for the reasons I have stated, and others that I will state by and by, but perhaps the House will give me leave now to explain what my conjecture is and what are the grounds upon which I rest it. I desire your lordships to receive it as conjecture only; I do not pronounce it as fact, <i>"Valeat, quantum valere potest."</i><lb/>
In explaining it, I must mention a fact, curious indeed, but yet not redounding to the credit of men otherwise entitled to our respect. I fear I must include in the censure, that truly patriotic nobleman, lord Southampton, who, at the period of which I speak, seems to have taken an active part in this House, as active indeed, as lord Clarendon himself. The fact I allude to is related by Carte, in his Life of the Duke of Ormonde,<sup>*</sup> and has been confirmed by the testimony of contemporaries, which subsequent publications, in the course of the last half century, have disclosed. The duke of Ormonde, while residing abroad with Charles 2nd at Cologne, discovered,

<quote>"He" (Ormonde) "had kept the discovery of the king's change a secret from his friend the chancellor all the time they were abroad together, but <i>now</i> he thought it necessary to discover it to him and the earl of Southampton, that they might agree on <i>some measures</i> to prevent as well the king's being prevailed upon to declare himself, as the Roman Catholic priests publishing his secretly embracing their religion. They apprehended very ill consequences from either of them, and agreed that, as soon as the new parliament should meet, a clause should be inserted in some act to make it a <i>pr&#x0153;munire</i> for any person to say, that the king was a Papist.&#x2014;This was the first act that passed for the security of his majesty's person and government."</quote>

to his sorrow and dismay, that the exiled prince, whose fortunes he was following, was unquestionably a Roman Catholic. He discovered the circumstance by an accidental disclosure of his habits of devotion; and his discovery was confirmed by the concurrent testimony of sir Henry Bennett, afterwards lord Arlington, and of lord Bristol. He felt all the importance, he dreaded all the consequences of the fact he had discovered; but he kept it secret from his friends, and even from his dearest friend, lord Clarendon, nor did he divulge it to him, until after their arrival in England. Soon after the Restoration it was found that the king, from motives unknown to Clarendon or Southampton, had determined to marry a Roman Catholic, the Infanta of Portugal. The duke of Ormonde, naturally suspecting the real, but hidden, motive of this determination, disclosed the result of his observations and inquiries about the king's religion, to his two great political friends and associates. Hereupon the three statesmen held a council as to what was to be done on so momentous and alarming an occasion. My lords, I blush to relate the result of this grave deliberation, It is painful to expose the iniquities of men generally good. They thought, and justly thought, that the knowledge of the fact might renew the troubles of the kingdom, create suspicion among Protestants, and by elating the hopes of the Roman Catholics, encourage them to promote plots both at home and abroad. They thought, moreover, that, combined with the king's connection with the court of France, the fact itself might facilitate designs against the liberties of the country. Well, then, what did they do in this emergency? <i>Oh Gloria &#x0021;</i> these wise and good men, for such I allow them, especially lord Southampton, generally to have been, determined to bring in a law, to make it a Pr&#x00E6;munire to say that the king was a Papist&#x0021; A law to despoil every man of hisproperty, for saying that which they had ascertained to be true; and to do so because they had ascertained it to be true-One is really sorry to relate such anecdotes, and yet when noble lords talk as they are a little too prone to do, of the virtue and wisdom of our ancestors, it is, I own, somewhat tempting, and may prove not altogether unwholesome, to bring to light the peccadilloes, which some of the best of them committed in their time. These great states-

<col>1457</col>
men knew that the king was a Papist; they knew it from the duke of Ormonde, and yet they devised and passed a law to subject any innocent or honourable man who should do by others what the duke of Ormonde had done by them, namely, communicate what was true, to the forfeiture of his goods and chattels, and to all the heavy penalties of a pr&#x00E6;munire. I would fain believe, and I do, that they and especially Southampton, when they resorted to such shameful and unjustifiable means of protecting the prince from annoyance, were equally anxious to do something for the security of the people. I am inclined to think that, with that view, the test to which I have been referring was introduced by this House, and perhaps by lord Southampton himself, into the Corporation act. They might, from the discovery they had made, have become anxious to keep Roman Catholics out of corporations. They might reasonably argue thus&#x2014;" we are driving out of corporations large bodies of these Covenanters and Puritans; we really have not cavaliers and partizans enough who are Protestants to fill the vacancies. The consequence will be, there will be many Roman Catholics elected, and when the king shall find that party strong, for which he has a secret predilection, he may harbour further designs, and avow them; and when they, the Papists, learn that the king is of their religion, they may be tempted to aspire to an ascendancy, of which, in any other circumstances, they must despair. To provide against all this, let us endeavour to keep Roman Catholics out of corporations; and here is an opportunity of doing it, as it were, clandestinely:&#x2014;slip into this Corporation act a test which none who is not a Protestant can possibly take."<lb/>
As I before remarked, I give this merely as a conjecture.&#x2014;It is however clear, from our Journals, that Southampton attended the bill constantly; and history reports him as taking an active part in the progress of it.&#x2014;But, while I am not prepared to describe my conjecture as unquestionably true, I am prepared boldly to defy contradiction, when I say, that there is no ground for supposing that the clause was directed against Protestant Dissenters.&#x2014;It could not apply at the time to any Protestant Dissenters.&#x2014;All, or nearly all, would have taken it without scruple. It has indeed been said, that Independents would not; but, even if there is any truth
<col>1458</col>
in that exception, which I doubt, it extended to very few of that denomination.<lb/>
The truth is, that occasional conformity was practised by all Protestant Dissenters, down to the time of the reign of queen Anne, when the act against it was passed, and at the period of which I am now speaking, it was not only practised and allowed by the strictest among them, but actually enjoined as a duty.&#x2014;Baxter, their great authority, so considered it. He, and they who followed him, deemed schism a crime; and, wherever a Protestant church was established, even though it retained rites which in their judgment were objectionable, nay actually abominations, they nevertheless remained in communion with that church, and enjoined occasional conformity as a duty.<lb/>
The reverend lords will bear me out in this statement.&#x2014;The practice of an occasional conformity continued, with some individual exceptions, through the whole reign of Charles 2nd&#x2014;and endured to the time of queen Anne. This your lordships should bear in mind; for, when people talk of the authority of an act of Parliament, of the wisdom of our ancestors, the test of long experience, and other matters of that kind, as affecting this question&#x2014;let it be always recollected, that these vaunted acts, so wise, so expedient, so provident, have never been in actual force, never practically executed for more than three or, at the most, seven years, during the whole hundred and fifty-six that they have remained on your Statute-book&#x2014;that is the period between the passing the Occasional-Conformity-bill, and its repeal, which was, if I mistake not, in 1718.<lb/>
This remark applies to both the acts&#x2014;but I return to the Corporation act, and, though the effect of it has, in some respects, been greater than that of the Test act, I insist upon its spirit, its intent, and its enactments, being entirely different.&#x2014;Not only the penalty inflicted for omission was milder, but it must never be forgotten, the test imposed, though by subsequent events it became the same, was, at the time of passing the first act, unknown, uncertain and undetermined. They who imposed it could not know what it was, nor positively foresee what it would be, nor consequently whom it would admit or whom it would exclude.&#x2014;The penalty was merely the loss of the place, nor did the act insist on a man taking the Sacrament on his ac-

cepting office. That holy rite was not made the stepping-stone to worldly advantage. The person elected, or appointed, was obliged to bring proofs, or certificates, of having, within a certain time, two years I think&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01353"><member>Lord Eldon</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;One year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01354"><member>Lord Holland</member><membercontribution>.&#x2014;I thank my noble and learned friend; one year, then, taken the Sacrament, according to the rites of the Church of England&#x2014;and this provision was not to take place till two years after the passing of the act. Now, how could the legislators of that day anticipate future legislation any more than we can do? Unless they did, how could they know, before-hand, what the test they were prescribing would, two years afterwards, be? Suppose the act of Uniformity had not passed, what then would have been the effect of the Corporation act which passed before it? Why, it would have stood thus: All persons accepting office in a corporation must have taken the Sacrament according to the rites of the Presbyterian church, or rather according to the individual whim of the officiating parish minister, who might decide what those rites, in the particular instance, should be.&#x2014;The general design of the Corporation act was to effect a purpose possibly salutary, possibly necessary, but certainly of a temporary nature. Many of its provisions have expired; others are repealed; and in those points, as in others, it forms a complete contrast to the Test act, and is as much at variance with it, in its subsequent fate and treatment, as it was in its original design, history and principle.<lb/>
The Test act, to which I now come, was founded on a distrust of the exercise of the prerogative; it sprung from a deep-rooted suspicion in the public, of the possessor of, and a yet deeper of the presumptive heir to, the Crown. It was wrested from the king&#x2014;he had recourse to every subterfuge to avoid it. The Money-bill was actually withheld until the Crown had given its consent to the Test act.&#x2014;It was, in truth, a stigma, perhaps well merited, but a stigma fixed on the reigning prince and his family, and it was known and felt to be an invasion of what had always been the true, ancient, and lawful prerogative of the Crown.<lb/>
That such was the case, no man who reads the history of the times, can, for one moment, doubt. It followed the Declaration of Indulgence, and the strange, in-
<col>1460</col>
consistent, I know not how to describe the sudden conversion of that extraordinary man, lord Shaftesbury. It arose out of cabals, irritation and violence, scarcely paralleled in our history.<lb/>
But, why do I argue such a point? Read the act: look to the ingredients of the drug; look to the label upon it, and doubt, if you can, what disorder it was intended to remedy. What say the title and the preamble; for they are mixed up together, and are, in truth, one and the same.&#x2014;Do they say, the act is directed against Protestant Dissenters?&#x2014;that it is to enforce conformity?&#x2014;to secure the Crown?&#x2014;to form a bulwark for the church?&#x2014;to strengthen alliance between church and state? &amp;c. &amp;c.&#x2014;No &#x0021; not a word of all this. It is, "to prevent the danger arising from Popish Recusants, and for quieting the minds of his Majesty's subjects." It was not, then, intended to strengthen the Crown, nor to defend the church, nor to unite it with the Crown, then in possession of the enemy it most dreaded: it was passed to allay the suspicions of the people, with respect to the-designs of the prince upon the Throne. With proofs of this the debates and memoirs of the time abound.&#x2014;I could go through them in detail; but it would waste your lordships' time, and your recollection, or a reference to the historical documents will satisfy you, that the view I have given of the transaction is not to be denied.&#x2014;One fact is conclusive&#x2014;all the Dissenters in the House of Commons, no inconsiderable number, voted for the Test act.&#x2014;I do not know that all the bishops in the Lords' did.&#x2014;I am inclined to think not, but, I do not know&#x2014;that it was supported by the Dissenters I do.&#x2014;And yet, true it is, that some of those Dissenters, very few I believe, but some, had begun to differ by that time, with Baxter's doctrine, and had grown somewhat scrupulous about occasional conformity with the church. There was one distinguished for his honesty, in those troublesome times, who had served in parliament in Charles 1st time, and lived to see the Revolution of 1688.&#x2014;I mean Mr. Love.&#x2014;He stated, when the Test act was in the Commons, that it might aggrieve him and some of his brethren, but, that they would vote for it in full expectation of a speedy measure of relief. Such, indeed, was the understanding; and there was at that very
<image src="S2V0018P0I0738"/>
<col>1461</col>
moment a bill actually in the House for the ease of Protestant Dissenters.&#x2014;A bill to relieve them, by a side wind, from the pressure of the Test, or I should rather say, to accommodate the Test in a way not to aggrieve them, but admit them into the church. That bill was intended to go side by side, <i>pari passu</i>, with the Test act; but before they reached their destined goal, the Dissenters, to use a vulgar phrase, were jockeyed out of their relief; and, by some crossing and jostling, the Test act got the start; and the Money-bill having passed also, the king was not sorry to prorogue the parliament, and leave the Dissenters in the lurch.&#x2014;Truth is, my lords, the great and wise men of that day&#x2014;and great and wise men there were among them&#x2014;who contributed to pass the Test act, accepted it or resorted to it as a substitute for something they thought better, but could not attain and durst not attempt.&#x2014;Throughout the reign, they were all suspicious of the king, and yet more of his brother.&#x2014;It was thought he had designs&#x2014;it was known he had connections with foreign countries. These public men were too well read in the constitution, too deeply imbued with the true principles of liberty, not to know, that the confirmation of their suspicions would justify, and, in prudence, require, the exclusion of a family engaged in such designs.&#x2014;They knew that a king, who could not safely be trusted with the just prerogatives of the Crown, was not fit to reign, and should be expelled or excluded. But they could not achieve that object, nor attempt it, without danger, and they satisfied themselves with that which, if less fit, was more attainable, namely, a limitation and restriction of the prerogative.&#x2014;In this many persons, especially Church of England men, who shuddered at the notion of exclusion, or of any interruption in the succession, were willing to acquiesce.<lb/>
This is the key to the whole transaction, and the Test act was consequently passed to guard against a Popish prince and a Popish successor&#x2014;then, to all appearance, an inevitable inconvenience.&#x2014;But, now all such dangers have vanished: we have fortunately got rid of the Stuarts; they and the dangers they menaced are buried and gone with all the Capulets. We have no dread of a Popish prince or a Popish successor. We have neither; the thing is impossible, and the provisions then devised against its consequences are
<col>1462</col>
now clearly unnecessary, and inapplicable. Our laws secure us a Protestant prince, and a Protestant succession; and even with respect to our Roman Catholic fellow subjects, the danger, if any, of their admission to their rights, is otherwise amply provided against&#x2014;I think, unnecessarily, and unwisely&#x2014;I would, as the House well knows, most gladly remove those restrictions; but be that as it will, the acts now before us neither are necessary, nor useful, to the maintenance of them.&#x2014;Persons anxious to keep out Roman Catholics will have their object as completely secured by the laws which will remain after this bill is passed, as they could be by those which it repeals.<lb/>
I will not dwell on the dreadful penalties inflicted by the Test act, not only for non-compliance, but for mere neglect of its provisions.&#x2014;My lords, they are terrible&#x2014;loss and incapacity of office, incapacity of inheriting legacies, of acting as guardians or executors, and fines to an enormous amount. Punishments, in short, equivalent almost to civil death and outlawry itself.<lb/>
What I have endeavoured to prove is, that the original intention and present effect of the act are at variance&#x2014;that the principles from which it sprung are almost the reverse of those which its continuance on the Statute-book sanctions, and on which its supporters defend that continuance.&#x2014;It meant to protect, assist, and cooperate with, Protestant Dissenters&#x2014;it now oppresses or degrades them&#x0021; It was directed against Roman Catholics only&#x2014;they are now excluded by the operation of other acts. The principle which the existence of this act now establishes is that of jealousy of a Protestant prince, and of a Protestant people. It is one injurious to the prerogatives of the Crown, injurious to the privileges of the people, oppressive to the Dissenter, invasive of the rights of the Church itself, and inconvenient to the state. The prerogatives of the Crown were not given for the personal gratification of the prince, but for the benefit of the people; they form part, and an essential part, too, of their privileges. Noble lords may smile at hearing me extol the prerogative; but it is, and has always been, my opinion, no act or conduct of mine, during my whole political life, is inconsistent with that opinion, and I could cite more than one which would prove my adherence to it in practice as well as in theory. Prero-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0739"/>
<col>1463</col>
gative is privilege. Parliament and people may advise the king in the exercise of it, They may, and sometimes ought, to enforce that advice by the exertion of other privileges, with which the constitution ha; invested them; but I repeat it, they cannot trench, by positive law, on the just and ancient prerogatives, and, above all this particular prerogative, without injury to themselves, and injustice to the community. For what is this prerogative?&#x2014;The right of the prince on the throne to call on the services of all his liege subjects, and the right of rewarding them for the honest and zealous discharge of those services. What power more grateful to a generous mind, more congenial to the feelings of a prince of the House of Brunswick, or more conducive to the real benefit of the community?&#x2014;Why, then, are such portions of our fellow-subjects to be debarred of the honour of serving a monarch to whom they are attached, and why are we to withhold from him the prerogative of rewarding them?&#x2014;
<quote>&#x2014;"Reward,</quote>
<quote>The part of Heaven in Kings; for Punishment</quote>
<quote>Is Hangman's work, and drudgery for Devils."<sup>*</sup></quote>
It is that noble and godlike prerogative which this iniquitous, impious, and unnecessary, law, in principle, seeks to disfigure and abridge. The principle it would establish is this, that a man's religion, not his character, his talents, or his actions, fit him for office, or entitle him to reward. The lesson it teaches is this&#x2014;that the gratitude of the state shall be limited to those with whom it agrees in religion, not extended to those on whom it depends for support, or from whom it derives strength and prosperity&#x2014;that the zeal, the labour, the devotions of the subject shall be checked, if he cannot, on matters purely speculative and abstract, on which Providence has ordained that we should almost all differ, either agree, or affect to agree, with certain dogmas and theories of authority.&#x2014;After he has
<quote>"Scorn'd delights and liv'd laborious days,"</quote>
animated with a zeal to serve his prince and his country, and to raise his name among the benefactors of mankind, and, when he expects to find the fair guerdon of his exertions, then steps forward this accursed law, and says" No; you have earned these honours, it is true, but I shall
<quote><sup>*</sup> Dryden.</quote>
<col>1464</col>
snatch them from you; you have shewn the zeal, and borne the burthen, of a subject, but the fame, the reward, the distinction, shall never be yours&#x2014;and why? because (oh, shame&#x0021;), because you have some conscientious scruples about the manner of taking the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper."&#x2014;and, are there men, and Englishmen, who will maintain, that this is no persecution, no hardship, no injustice? Can they, with the praises of the constitution flickering on their lips&#x2014;of that constitution, one principal maxim of which is, that he who contributes to the state has a share of its power, that all born under it are eligible according to their merits&#x2014;can they, I say, after vaunting their attachment to such a constitution, have the face to assert, that those who are debarred from its enjoyments, suffer no injury, and have no right to complain? Shall they tell me that I am indulged with paying the taxes and performing the duties of a subject, and that that is a circumstance which must endear to me the government of the country; that the privation of power, emolument, and fame, is a mere trifle, a nothing.&#x2014;I can have no right to political power; I may be thankful for living in a country where I may enjoy my personal liberty, my property, and my opinions&#x2014;while they, forsooth, revelling in the possession of that very power, striving to procure it, enjoying it when obtained, and attached to the constitution from whence they derive it (for it is a little remarkable, my lords, that those who maintain that the privation of political power is no great evil, are, in their own persons, mighty lovers of that same article, and annex no small value to the monopoly of it) kindly undertake the task of persuading me, that it is no grievance to be excluded, without fault of my own, from enjoyments so gratifying to them, and to which, but for these statutes, I might have reasonably aspired? Such is the lesson these laws inculcate, such the language by which they must be defended.<lb/>
Another principle sanctioned by the Test act is the right of the state to render religious ordinances subservient to purposes purely political.&#x2014;I approach this subject with some delicacy and apprehension&#x2014;I feel a reluctance in commenting on the inferences which men draw from their sense of religion, because I am conscious that I am speaking to many who are more earnestly impressed than myself with the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0740"/>
<col>1465</col>
solemnity of such topics, and I should be deeply concerned, if a phrase should escape me, that gave them the slightest pain, either as irreverent in itself, or reflecting on their sincerity.&#x2014;I must, however, acknowledge, that it always has been a standing wonder with me, how persons sincerely and deeply impressed with a sense of religion, and with the importance and solemnity of that rite of religion in particular, could reconcile to their consciences, the selection of the Lord's Supper as a test and qualification for worldly offices&#x2014;I do not question their sincerity, I am, on the contrary, satisfied of it; but I own I consider it as one among the many humiliating proofs of the strange contradictions in the human understanding&#x2014;for mark the operation of this law, and consider the extent and consequences of the profanation, which, if it does not compel, it tempts so many to commit&#x0021;&#x2014;In the first place, to the scoffer, to the man of no religion, it prostitutes the most holy ceremony of the Church. He has no scruple, though he may have no desire, to take the Communion; but this law makes it his interest; and, to serve his interest, the Church must administer it to him; and this, too, for its security&#x0021; What security in a test which its bitterest enemies can take, and which is not so likely to disarm their enmity, as to invite their impiety and derision?&#x2014;The hypocrite and the infidel are admitted&#x2014;the conscientious Dissenter is excluded.&#x2014;What is the justice&#x2014;where is the sense of such a proceeding? What is the nature of that device which, miscalled protection, lets in your enemy, if enemy you have&#x2014;lets in the unprincipled, and excludes none but the conscientious? If a man is sincerely a Dissenter, this law exposes him to temptation. Does he resist it?&#x2014;the state is deprived of the services of an honest man. Does he yield?&#x2014;where is your security against his opinions, or, if you will have it so, his hostility? Do you think it is disarmed or mitigated, because you have galled him in the tenderest point, wounded his conscience, and disturbed his repose?<lb/>
But not Dissenters only are exposed to such painful trials by this law&#x2014;look to its operation on the churchmen&#x2014;for they, too, are exposed to temptations, they, too, may be betrayed by its operation to commit a sin which may embitter the rest of their lives with self-reproach and remorse. The strict doctrine of the church, with
<col>1466</col>
respect to this holy rite, is, if I mistake not, no less than this:&#x2014;Every communicant must approach the altar with faith, charity, repentance, and a stedfast purpose to lead a new life; he must be prepared to partake of the Lord's Supper in a temper suitable to so solemn a covenant with the Deity&#x2014;nay more,&#x2014;the absence of such disposition, at such a moment, is a sin, and visited with anathemas dreadful even to repeat. He that eats of the bread and drinks of the cup unprepared, eats and drinks, according to the strict interpretation of the church, his own damnation.&#x2014;Such, if I mistake not, is the awful denunciation, the orthodox principle, of the Church of England. What, then, says the law?&#x2014;It says to the member of that church, when appointed to office&#x2014;"You must either renounce your prospects and your office or you must take this awful Sacrament without reference to your being properly prepared to do so or not."&#x2014;It says to him, at the moment his ambition is gratified, and worldly prospects are opening before him, that is, in the hour of his elation and prosperity, a season surely not particularly propitious to self-abasement and repentance, "Eat and drink at the risk of your salvation hereafter, or refuse at the certain loss to yourself and your family of all worldly advancement and prosperity here." Gracious God, my lords, can there be a system more horrid, or torture more refined, than this?&#x2014;One's reason revolts, one's heart recoils, at so iniquitous, so cruel, an alternative. The ingenuity of man can scarcely devise a more exquisite torment for a mind impressed with religious awe, and at the same time glowing with zeal and affection for his country, his family, and his friends. Nor is it the communicant alone who is exposed to these cruel dilemmas. The clergyman who, in the discharge of his sacred functions, is sincerely and painfully anxious to administer the Sacrament in a manner agreeably to the injunctions of his church, and pleasing in the sight of the Deity himself, is placed by this law in a cruel and perplexing predicament. He is exposed both to self-reproach and to ecclesiastical censure, if he administers the Sacrament to the unworthy, and he is equally exposed, if I am rightly informed, to penal consequences, or at least to legal vexations and humiliation, if he refuses it. I know not how far a beneficed clergyman can be compelled to observe the rubrick
<image src="S2V0018P0I0741"/>
<col>1467</col>
and the canons, but I conclude there is some process, and I am sure if there is not the means of enforcing the obligation, he has by his oath and his office contracted that of observing them.&#x2014;Yet by the legal consequences arising from these Test and Corporation laws, that observance may expose him to temporal punishment, or at least to being questioned in temporal courts. The canons, and I think the rubrick, say, he shall not administer the Sacrament to bad livers, to the profligate, to the blasphemers, to persons who live in enmity with their neighbours&#x2014;but if any of those, on appointment to office, come to take the Sacrament, and he refuses it, an action against him for damages will lie&#x2014;at least, I believe so. I see a noble and learned lord seems to doubt it, and I may be wrong; but even if be, it is equally favourable to my argument. I have a dilemma from which there is no escaping, as I shall presently explain.&#x2014;It certainly is the general opinion, and not an unreasonable one, that while these laws are in force, an action will lie in the common courts of law against a clergyman who refuses the Sacrament to a man who applies to be qualified for an office by taking it. There is a civil injury and damage&#x2014;and if it is said that the clergyman may justify, his spiritual functions are equally subjected to the cognizance of a secular tribunal. Now mind, my lords, what might happen&#x2014;I will suppose it possible,&#x2014;an extreme case, perhaps, but yet possible&#x2014;that a king should appoint a lord chancellor not quite so moral as the famous lord Shaftesbury, and a Secretary of State not quite so pious and religious as the equally famous lord Bolingbroke. I will further suppose, that to some subordinate situation in the law, was advanced, at the same time, a smart barrister, who was more remarkable for his ready acuteness, learning, and vivacity, than for sweetness of temper, or mildness of disposition. Well, we will conduct these three persons together to church to qualify for their recent appointments, and there we will further suppose that the parish priest, without being an absolute parson Adams, has yet the simplicity to imagine that his spiritual duties supersede all other considerations, and that, in observing the injunctions of his ecclesiastical superiors, and the canons of his church, he can incur neither injury nor reproach, or offend the laws of God or of man. Well, then, when
<col>1468</col>
the two noblemen and the lawyer present themselves, he says to the first, "My lord, I really am very sorry, but I cannot receive you at the communion table; really there are some circumstances so notorious in my parish respecting your lordship's moral character and conduct, that I must conscientiously consider you as one of the 'bad livers,' from whom I am compelled to withhold the Sacrament&#x2014;and as to you, my lord," turning to the Secretary of State, "I really have seen in manuscript and in print such writings, and have heard from credible authority, such language of your lordship's, respecting the very ceremony I am about to administer, and the Deity, whose altar you now wish to approach, that till I am enjoined by my ecclesiastical superiors to communicate with blasphemers and infidels, I must decline handing the bread and wine to your lordship.&#x2014;As to you, Sir," turning to the lawyer, "it is equally impossible for me to admit you. Why, it is notorious, you have brought lawsuits, and stirred about disputes among my parishioners. You are not upon speaking terms with one half of them, and there is a want of charity and good-fellowship in all your conduct in the parish, that clearly brings you within the description of persons to whom I am precluded from offering the Holy Sacrament."<lb/>
Now what, as the law now stands, would be the answer to the clergyman so conducting himself, according to the strict duties of his sacred profession? The two lords possibly would withdraw themselves in silence, and with that politeness and courtesy, which the habits of such high station, and the intercourse with members of this House so naturally create. But, not so the little lawyer, who, by the terms of my hypothesis, is a captious, sharp, and disputatious, practitioner. What then could he, and what in probability would he, say? Something like this:&#x2014;" You won't give me the Sacrament, Mr. Reverend, won't you; Very well, we'll see who'll gain at that game.&#x2014;We'll have you <i>in Banco Regis</i> in no time.&#x2014;I'll have swinging damages of you. You have spoilt my preferment, lost me my place, and you shall pay for it.&#x2014;I'll let fly my little <i>Per Quods</i> at you, and we shall soon see who'll smart for the costs." Oh, but it may be said, the clergyman may justify, may plead the fact and the law, and get a verdict in his favour. Be it so, and be the judges and

jury (the latter of which may, by the by, all be Dissenters) as impartial, as just, and as discerning, in such a case, as the Ecclesiastical Court itself; still there is the anomaly of a Secular Court deciding on a matter purely spiritual, namely, the fitness of a man to take the holy Sacrament, and the propriety of the conscientious motives which induced the priest to refuse it. My lords, this anomaly is, as far as it goes, an indignity to the clergy. Let me not be told, that no church, but the church of Rome, would so consider it; that no priesthood, but such as are Popish, hold their heads so high, or view with any jealousy, even an unnecessary and unusual interference of secular authorities. It is not so; all churches&#x2014;and Protestant churches&#x2014;feel in some degree such a jealousy. I will not quote bishop Gibson, and others of minor authority. I will go to the first and greatest authority among Protestants, to the early Reformers themselves. What will the learned lord say to Luther himself?&#x2014;Speaking of the mania of meddling with ecclesiastical matters, which it seems that some of the learned profession of the law were affected with, even in his day, he has the following passage;&#x2014;but when I read part of it, I must beg the House, and the right reverend prelates to recollect, that certain strong phrases in it are not mine, but those of an intrepid and sanctified reformer.&#x2014;"I could wish," says he, "the lawyers would appear in the game, so would I thoroughly try and teach them what <i>jubjectum Juris</i> is. I acknowledge <i>Jus</i> is a fair spouse, so long as she remaineth in her own bed, but when she strideth into that of another, and will rule divinitie in the church, then she becometh a great strumpet and&#x2014;" (<i>Illud quod dicere nolo</i>, my lords, for the word is too strong for polite ears) "I never read such fundamental and fearful examples of heart's-hardening as in lawyers. They far surpass the Jews, Pharaoh and the others. In a word, they are next neighbours to the devil. My heart panteth and quaketh whenever I think of them."<sup>*</sup><lb/>
But to return to the question, whether such an action against a clergyman, as I have made a lawyer describe would lie or not? I will tell your lordships my authorities, without pretending they are conclusive, and with this remark, that it is indifferent to my argument whether they be so
<sup>*</sup> Luther's Works translated into English, p. 418.<lb/>
<col>1470</col>
or no, because either way, the anomaly produced by the statute in question, injurious in one case to the clergy, in the other to the state and the community is a grievance. I have no positive rule of law or dictum of a judge to justify me in the supposition that such an action would lie; but there has always been a persuasion, that it would, and that persuasion expressed, if not by great lawyers, yet by grave, sedate, and learned men. I will not quote Oldmixon as one, though with all his partiality and bitterness, he is a writer by no means despicable for his acuteness, and knowledge; and on this point more intitled to notice, as living, and writing near the time between the passing, and the repeal of, the Occasional Conformity bill; when the provisions of the Test act were actually and strictly executed, and the real practical operation of the law might be ascertained. But this opinion is strongly confirmed by what passed on the repeal of the Occasional Conformity bill, and to which I have before alluded; I mean the clause moved by lord Stanhope in this House, On the 19th December, 1718. The preamble of that clause runs thus:<sup>*</sup> "Whereas great complaint has been made by the clergy of the Church of England as by law established, that they axe, <i>frequently threatened with vexatious law suits</i>, and exposed to other hardships in case they refuse to administer the holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper to such persons, as by reason of their offices or places of trust, are obliged to receive the same." Lord Stanhope was not, indeed, a lawyer, and I allow that his (object in this clause, being, in truth, to relieve the Dissenters from the test), his recital in the preamble, of the hardship felt or apprehended by the clergy, was a pretence on which to engraft the strange enactment that followed: namely, that no clergyman should be sued for refusing the sacrament to a person appointed to office, and that a person so appointed, and writing to offer to take the sacrament, and receiving no answer, should be considered as having taken it, for all the purposes of the Test act. But, acknowledging this, I still think the clause is some evidence of the law and the practice, or at least the opinion of the law, at that day; for lord Stanhope, in addition to his personal knowledge and abilities, was Secretary of State, and it is hardly credible that
<quote><sup>*</sup> See Lords' Journals, 1718.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0743"/>
<col>1471</col>
he should have recited, as the reason or the pretext of a measure he recommended, an allegation, which, if not true, he must have known to have been false, and which could so readily have been refuted. But no matter how this really stands. Suppose the action does not lie&#x2014;suppose the clergy are exposed to no such hardships as I have described, and the clause of lord Stanhope professed to remedy; what, then, is the consequence? why, different indeed, but if possible yet worse. The clergy, as I have shewn, do not wish the secular to interfere with their spiritual jurisdiction. Still less, give me leave to say, for the people of England, do we laymen and subjects, wish the spiritual to interfere with secular jurisdictions and rights. Now, if the clergy can refuse the sacrament to whom they please, or at least, to whom their spiritual courts please, and if the refusal of the sacrament is a bar to advancement in the army, in the law, in all civil employment and professions, it then follows, that the clergy and ecclesiastical courts, have a veto on the king's prerogative; though not the distribution of patronage, the power of intercepting all civil promotion. Where could such power be more improvidently, more improperly, lodged? Is there any man who would submit to transfer this ancient prerogative of the Crown to the clergy, to the parson of the parish, to the judges of those spiritual courts, whose tedious process is at once the nuisance and laughing-stock of the country? Either way the principle and effect of the act, if really enforced, is anomalous and injurious. Parsons and civilians, the individuals least qualified to exercise such a discretion, have a veto on the king's prerogative, and a voice in the promotion of the king's subjects, or the courts of common-law have a right to interfere in a question purely spiritual, and to decide, not on the actions, but on the religious principles of individuals, and their fitness and preparation for ghostly and spiritual comfort; absurd, and objectionable, all ways, and absurdity and objections, flowing as direct consequences from the law I now propose to repeal.<lb/>
But the best way to expose the iniquity, the monstrous iniquity of the law, would be to, suppose what is nearly impossible that it should really be unchained and let loose on society, that the Annual Indemnity bills, as they are miscalled, should not pass. What would ensue? Such a scene of confusion, injustice, and oppression, as no
<col>1472</col>
tongue can tell, and no country, accustomed to a regular administration of law, and to the enjoyment of freedom, could endure to submit to. I wish to speak with decency and respect, but my hypothesis, the hypothesis that the law should be enforced&#x0021; is revolting in itself. Why, I speak: within compass, when I say, that two thirds, nay, three fourths, of the persons employed in all branches of the public service have never complied with this law. And if so, I say parliament will not, cannot, in spite of its omnipotence, which I do not wish to disparage, parliament, I say, or wag on the point of saying, dare not let the law be enforced. Imagine only&#x2014;figure to yourselves&#x2014;what would follow. Your magistrates at one fell blow converted into criminals; your admirals and generals, your navy and your army turned out outcasts, beggars, and delinquents, on society, and pointed at as slaves and felons in the land which they had saved.<lb/>
But I may be told, "this is all good for declamation and rhetorical flourish&#x2014;but you are describing what neither is, has been, or can ever be: your grievance is imaginary, great, no doubt, but such as can never occur. The Indemnity bills prevent all this mischief, and will continue to prevent it; and therefore no change in the present state of things can be necessary." If such be the answer, I reply first (without, however, granting the fact of the Indemnity acts removing all practical grievance, to which I shall come presently) with a question to those who answer me:&#x2014;And I say, if my grievance is imaginary what is your security?&#x2014;The security must be imaginary if the grievance is so, but the converse of the proposition is not true, and the grievance may be real, and in many senses it is real, though the security is imaginary.&#x2014;Persons may not be practically excluded; and, if not, the security offered by the law is defeated; and yet the admission, the manner of the admission, the condition of those so admitted, may be, and in truth it is, a great and galling grievance. Surely, surely, we are not disposed to harbour such grovelling sentiments&#x2014;to admit of so false as well as so degrading a system of philosophy, as to deem nothing a grievance that does not touch our pockets, rob, or deprive us of pounds, shillings, and pence, or injure our mere interests &#x0021;&#x2014;What? is there no passion but avarice and sordid selfish ambition in mankind, and, above all, in Englishmen?
<image src="S2V0018P0I0744"/>
<col>1473</col>
&#x2014;No love of glory, no zeal for one's country, no ardour for distinction, no jealous sense of honour, no honest pride?&#x2014;Will not every man of common observation, or of common feeling, will not, I repeat it, every Englishman, I will not say this House, whose very essence is honour, spurn the miserable sophistry which denies that degradation, unmerited inferiority, and exposure to reproach, where there is no moral turpitude, is a hardship, a grievance, and almost an intolerable one? Is it no mortification to the conscientious magistrate who discharges his useful duties with advantage to the public, to feel that he is there by sufferance&#x2014;to feel he is there by another and inferior tenure than that of his colleagues and brethren&#x2014;to feel that because he has some notions on speculative points, (for which, as the involuntary results of his judgment, he is entitled neither to praise nor censure) he may be taunted with evasion and breach of those laws which it is his duty to administer? His brother magistrate, nay the parties he tries, might say to him, "You act indeed as a magistrate and are one, but you are not the less a delinquent. The sword of justice is hanging over you. You escape, indeed, from year to year, but you are neither innocent nor pardoned." This, I contend, is a moral grievance which the Indemnity bills leave untouched, or rather create. A grievance to the subject, and I may add an injury to the state&#x2014;for it is not to be supposed that your laws can be suspended on false pretences, that your Statute-book can exhibit subterfuge, impotence, and hypocrisy; and that those who administer them can be placed in the situation of "respited felons," without impairing in the public mind that reverence for the law, and that confidence in those who administer it, which in a wholesome condition of society, should always be preserved.<lb/>
But I return to actual grievance, and I say that these annual acts which by a misnomer are called Indemnity acts, but are merely acts for postponing the period of punishment: I say these acts may mitigate some, and may in truth annihilate much of the grievance, but they do not remove it.&#x2014;I have known in the circle of my own acquaintance, some fit for office and willing in other respects, who have been deterred by scruples from placing themselves in the situation I have just
<col>1474</col>
been describing&#x2014;and this too, not from, pride, but from conscience, from extreme, perhaps overstrained, reverence for the laws, and unwillingness, even in theory, to violate them. This may be over scrupulous, it may be a conscientiousness your lordships neither admire nor approve; but at least it is not one of a nature to disqualify men from office, since it arises from a feeling that peculiarly renders a man useful and honest in the discharge of political duties.<lb/>
Other grievances, too, still remain. Dissenters in corporations may be borne harmless by the Indemnity bills. After six months unmolested enjoyment of their offices, they are safe by the fifth of George 1st; but they may still be defeated in their endeavours to get there by the operation of the 13th of Charles 2nd. Notice that they are not qualified at the moment of the election will vitiate the votes given in their favour, and might, nay, I believe has, in some few instances, enabled a minority to carry an election against them.&#x2014;I will not press what I think a sound but somewhat nice and subtle argument, on the effect of these Indemnity bills. Practically, I know that persons in office, who have neglected to qualify, from whatever motive, can and do take the benefit of the act, and the astuteness of lawyers cannot certainly discover the means of ascertaining the motive of an omission&#x2014;above all when so loose a word as "accident" is admitted as a justifiable plea. Yet it has been urged, and it is true, that these bills do not profess to do more than to give time to qualify to those who from illness, accident, or absence, have omitted to do so; and those who omit to do so from scruple or dislike might, I have heard it urged, be debarred the benefit of these temporary respites. Even if such exception be impracticable, and if it be the real though concealed intention of the legislature, to rescue wilful as well as accidental negligence, from the penalties of the old acts (and it no doubt is so), the method of effecting the purpose is mean, indirect, cowardly, and highly discreditable to our legislation. I believe this construction has had some practical effect on those whose overstrained scruples and consequent exclusion from office I have before adverted to. It is whimsical however, that one of the most practical grievances which the present state of the law actually produces, falls exclusively on members of the Church of England. The
<image src="S2V0018P0I0745"/>
<col>1475</col>
grievance I allude to has shifted. It lay during the first half of last century, heavy on the Dissenter, but now it is shifted in a more mitigated shape upon the Church-of-England-man. In either case it elucidates that great truth, that a vicious principle cannot be admitted in legislation without inflicting injustice in some quarter or another, in a greater or a less degree. Your lordships know that in most corporations there are places of burthen as well as emolument. Now by common-law all subjects are obliged, under certain penalties, to take those offices, when imposed on them by the corporations to which they belong. In the course of last century this usage, combined with the Corporation act, was ingeniously but wickedly perverted to the purpose of extorting money from the Dissenters, who scrupled taking the Sacrament. Such was the case in London. The corporation was in the habit of choosing non-conformist sheriffs&#x2014;they knew they would not qualify, and they compelled them to pay the fine: I am sorry to mention such a practice in a body like the corporation of London, but I rejoice to think that that very body who, fifty or sixty years ago, acted with such bigotry and injustice, has justly and liberally petitioned this House to repeal those odious laws, which they formerly held in such superstitious veneration, and which they turned to; such iniquitous purposes. I am afraid the magnificent pile of the Mansion-house was raised out of these fines, and has been for that very reason somewhat severely, but not inaptly, called "the Palace of Intolerance." The practice went on till one who had, in his own sphere of life, that sturdy, honourable, and persevering spirit, which distinguished the immortal Hampden, and which is of more common growth in English bosoms than in any other, was marked out as its victim, Mr. Evans&#x2014;for the names of such unbending and useful men should be commemorated&#x2014;resisted the attempt; he fought his case intrepidly in all the courts of law, and through all the fields of chicanery and persecution, where his enemies were enabled to drag him, he finally appealed to this House. That appeal drew forth the ever memorable judgment of lord Mansfield, one of the greatest magistrates, and accomplished orators that ever graced the forum or the Senate. That speech and that judgment, whatever may have been his political delinquencies, and I am sure
<col>1476</col>
I do not know of any, though he was lavishly accused of them in the libels of the day, but I repeat, whatever they were, that noble speech and judgment, teeming with wisdom, philosophy, justice, and philanthropy, made a large amends for them all. They secured justice at the time; they have perpetuated benefits to posterity. He said in that speech, that he read the preface of De Thou every year of his life, and never without tears of gratitude and admiration for the just sentiments of religious liberty which it inculcates. My lords, one may say without extravagance, that the very speech in which his study of that great and impartial historian is recorded, should be studied as earnestly and as frequently by all who wish to imbibe the true principles of philosophical toleration and Christian charity in legislation. He decided, that the Toleration act had not, as some narrow minds had imagined, merely rescued the Dissenters from punishment and persecution; it had acknowledged their rights, protected their worship, and in some senses established their religion. After such an acknowledgment you could not (he said) convert their adherence to that dissect which you had legalized into a crime, and visit it with fine and punishment. Just and benevolent judgment, which rescued the Dissenter from extortion and vexation&#x2014;but what were its other consequences?&#x2014;Why, it threw on the members of the Church of England in corporate towns, an undue proportion of the burthens. The Dissenter urges his dissent, and escapes his fine&#x2014;the Church-of England-man must bear the burthen. It comes in consequence more frequently upon him, and he must pay the fine. Pass this bill, and both are on an equality&#x2014;in that respect some opulent Dissenters will lose money, and that speedily too, by the repeal which they are so active in soliciting. They know this well, but they do not and they will not relax in their endeavours. I honour them for it. It proves their spirit, their true English and honourable spirit, which prefers far above such considerations of pelf, the sense of conscious independence, the pride and satisfaction of equality before the law.<lb/>
My lords; I think I have proved that the original intention and view of these laws have been long since answered; that they are not, and cannot be, contemplated. in our times. That they were, in truth,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0746"/>
<col>1477</col>
distinct and different from, and in some senses actually opposite to, the principles which the continuance of these laws on the Statute-book now sanctions and inculcates. I think I have shown, that the principle, or rather the theory, of the law which is to be gathered from their present existence, is abhorrent to the spirit of our common-law and constitution, injurious to the prerogative of the Crown, and to the privileges of the People, derogatory to the Church, unjust to the Clergy, cruel to the Dissenter, and utterly repugnant to the temper of the times and the feelings and disposition of our society. I think I have shewn, that were such laws to be really executed, a scene of such confusion and iniquity would ensue, as no free and enlightened community could endure. I hope I have demonstrated, that the clumsy and disingenuous contrivance by which these consequences are eluded, are at once imperfect, disgraceful, and injurious to the State.<lb/>
Here, then, I close my case.&#x2014;If I have proved all this, I have a right to expect, nay to demand, of your wisdom, your charity, and your justice, the repeal of these laws&#x2014;I do so, loudly and confidently.&#x2014;I conjure you by every sense of duty, to cleanse your Statute-book of a pestilent humour, which, even in its quiescent state, taiuts the complexion and sours the aspect of our laws; and which, if any accident were to bring it into activity, would distort and disfigure, and perhaps destroy, the very frame of your constitution and society.<lb/>
My lords; I am aware that it is customary, in proposing the enactment or the repeal of any law which has been much discussed, to forestall the objections, after one has alleged the reasons for the measure one recommends. I prefer on this occasion, a breach to an observance of that custom&#x2014;not that I do not well recollect in my own time, and have not read in the works of others, many vehement and powerful remonstrances against the repeal of the Test act. But, though many of them proceeded from great politicians and great divines, they were at the time combated and answered by politicians as great, and divines as learned and as authoritative, of the same day. They were all too abstract, too metaphysical, and above all, too virulent and too polemical to make the revival of their controversies prudent, necessary, or useful&#x2014;I wish to avoid such topics.
<col>1478</col>
I think it advantageous to the peace of the world, as well as to the fair and dispassionate consideration of this measure, that they should not be introduced.&#x2014;All I will remark in them is this, that the same forebodings and predictions&#x2014;for they were such rather than arguments or inquiries&#x2014;were resorted to on the same subject, and urged with as much, or perhaps more, talent and success in Ireland as here. Dean Swift, in a work written in 1708, and reprinted in 1734, when a repeal of the Irish Test act was contemplated, a work distinguished by as much wit and acumen, and if possible by more acrimony than usual, paints in lively colours the effect of the Repeal.<lb/>
"When the door," says he, "is open to let Dissenters into the commissions of the peace, to make them high sheriffs, mayors of corporations, and officers of the army and militia, I do not see how it can be otherwise, considering their activity and our supineness"&#x2014;here the Dean, to borrow one of his own phrases, eats a little into his own cloth&#x2014;" but that they may, in a very few years, grow to a majority in the House of Commons, and consequently make themselves the national religion, and have a fair pretence to demand the revenues of the Church for their teachers."<lb/>
Such, were Swift's predictions, and the dread of their completion no doubt retarded the repeal of the Sacramental test in Ireland many years. Even when it passed in 1780, though the traces of so recent a transaction are wonderfully scanty and imperfect, it is clear that such apprehensions were not entirely extinct; for in the Journals of the Irish House of Lords is a protest, signed by four respectable prelates (one of whom was an archbishop), in terms vague indeed enough, but sufficiently alarming. They dissent, "because the bill makes an alteration in the Constitution of this kingdom, <i>the consequences whereof are much to be apprehended, though possibly they may not all be foreseen to their full extent."</i> The right reverend alarmists seem, indeed, not to have been very distinct in their prognostics of evil; and the calamity apprehended, to all appearance, will remain as unknown to posterity as it was unforeseen by those who most dreaded its approach.&#x2014;Near fifty years have elapsed&#x2014;the Church of Ireland, which surely is not built of stronger materials, or founded on a steadier rock than that of England, has been exposed
<image src="S2V0018P0I0747"/>
<col>1479</col>
neither to danger, nor even to panic, from the admission of Dissenters.&#x2014;None of its various perils are traced to that source: and, on the contrary, you have evidence upon oath, both from Churchmen and Dissenters, given before committees of this House, that the admission of Dissenters to office has produced no inconvenience, and much good-will, and that the revival of the Sacramental test would be a fearful experiment, deprecated both by Churchmen and Protestant Dissenters.<lb/>
As far, then, as the two cases are analogous, we have experience in favour of the repeal, and proof that alarms may be entertained on subjects of this kind by sincere men and zealous divines, which in experiment turns out to be groundless and visionary. With respect to more modern objections connected with our own times, I cannot answer them, for I have, with the exception of two, heard none whatever brought forward. Those two I will not refute, I will barely state them, and let them refute one another.&#x2014;It was said by that witty man to whose works I was just now alluding, that in the Custom-house "two and two do not make four;" and a much older author, Hesiod, I think, has said, in speaking of frugality, that he is a fool that does not know that the half is bigger than the whole.<sup>*</sup> One might parody such riddles in speaking of political logic; for it is possible that one objection enforced by authority, and urged with vehemence, might be too many for me; but when two such as I am about to repeat come together, I know pretty well how to deal with them. The first of the objections is, that this bill, if passed, will promote, accelerate, and perhaps secure&#x2014;the second objection is, that it will impede, retard, and perhaps defeat&#x2014;the measure which, for convenience sake, we call Catholic Emancipation. Now, both these speculations cannot be true, and they may well pair off together. Indeed it would require no great stretch of ingenuity to argue from the equal weight of authority which has maintained each of these conflicting propositions, that neither could be true, and that the bill, if passed, would probably neither promote nor impede, nor have any effect whatever, on the fate of the other impending discussion. Be that as it will, I certainly cannot with one poor
<quote>*<img src="Images\S2V0018P0I0747.jpg"/>&#x2014;Hesiod, <i>Opera et Dies</i>, v. 40,</quote>
<col>1480</col>
syllable deny, that, if I thought it would assist the Catholic measure, that circumstance would enhance its merit in my eyes&#x2014;that if on trial it shall be found to promote it, I shall rejoice&#x2014;but I can with truth profess, that such is not my motive for proposing or for urging it. If, on the other hand, it should prove injurious to the claims of the Roman Catholics, I shall deeply deplore such a result; but I shall not and cannot repent of the share I am taking in promoting this measure.&#x2014;I am so satisfied of the justice of this bill, that even if I apprehended such unpleasant consequences from it, I would not, I could not, from any such apprehension, alter my vote or relax my endeavours to carry it. God forbid that I should consent to perpetuate the injuries and insults inflicted on one class of men, for the purpose of swelling the grievance, strengthening the argument, or adding to the auxiliaries of another. Such crooked and iniquitous policy shall never guide my conduct, here or elsewhere. Such motive of action would be unparliamentary and unconstitutional; it would be worse, it would be base, immoral, and unjust; and I hope and believe I should disdain to resort to it.<lb/>
Having said thus much, let me add, in fairness to the Roman Catholics themselves, that some, most eminent among them for their rank and virtues, with whom I have conversed, openly and honourably applaud this sentiment. They have approved this view of the subject; nay, they have urged me, even if I deemed the measure unfavourable to them, to act justly by others, and not with reference to the advancement of their own claims&#x2014;they have told me, that they wished, on all such subjects, that what we deemed right we should do, and that on justice, not on contrivance, still less on the sacrifice of other men's claims or interests, they relied for the final success of their own cause.&#x2014;These are feelings that become them as Englishmen; and it is but bare justice to record them.<lb/>
It remains for me to say one word on another subject; namely, the part of the bill relating to a Declaration to be signed by those who take office. My lords, it is unnecessary for me to tell you, that that provision formed no part of the original bill, and it would be disingenuous in me not to acknowledge, that it is one which I should never have suggested either as necessary or useful, and that if the bill
<image src="S2V0018P0I0748"/>
<col>1481</col>
were without it, it would equally have my warm and zealous support; but yet I can with perfect honesty and sincerity, recommend the adoption of this part of the measure; for though, in my judgment, unnecessary, it allays, I am told, the fears of some, and gratifies the feelings of others.&#x2014;If the enactment of such a Declaration reconciles one conscientious mind to the measure I not only recommend, but cordially and earnestly urge its adoption, as giving to the great work in which we are engaged, not the character of victory, but that more desirable one, of peace, union, and conciliation.&#x2014;It is in that spirit I acquiesce. I recommend and support it. One reserve, however, I must make to protect myself on any future occasion from the charge of disingenuousness or inconsistency. My acquiescence in the Declaration, as here applied, does not preclude me from objecting to it strongly, if it be attempted to transfer it elsewhere. I see no objection to it as it stands&#x2014;I can hardly conceive that any man called upon by this bill to sign it, can object to it: at least, I am sure that were I to be appointed to office&#x2014;not a very likely event I acknowledge&#x2014;I should have no scruple whatever in signing it; but should any security-grinder, as they have been termed, at any subsequent period endeavour to transfer it, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, from office to seats in parliament, I must frankly avow that I should earnestly and strenuously resist it. Indeed, I hardly think I could, in my character of member of this House, sign it, or any promissory engagement, myself. I have not, God knows, nor am I likely to have, any intention, wish, or design, of subverting, weakening, or disturbing, the church established by law; but as a legislator I could not declare, that in no possible emergency I would consent to laws that might have that effect. Such scruple does not arise from any hostility to the Church. It applies to a promise of this nature with respect to any human institution. I should feel equally unwilling to declare as much in the character of legislator, in favour of the trial by jury, the privileges of parliament, the prerogatives of the Crown, the liberty of the press, or the rights of the people. The supreme power of parliament must, in my judgment, be always left at full liberty to legislate for the good of the country, as emergencies arise, and the exigencies of the State and the community may require. No shackles,
<col>1482</col>
no promises, no pledge, ought to bind a legislature, which, unless it is free and unfettered, cannot, in the vicissitude of human affairs, be sufficient to provide for the security and welfare of the community.<lb/>
My lords; I have done. I fear I have been dreadfully prolix, but your lordships must attribute that fault to its real cause&#x2014;my earnest desire that the merits of this great question should be fully understood by the House and the country; that the vote of this evening should be, and should be felt to be by the public and posterity, the result of calm and peaceable deliberation, not the termination of an angry contest; that it should be, not the triumph of one class of men over the prejudices of another, but the just and wise decision of the House for the interests and happiness of all. That so it may prove is my earnest prayer and confident hope.<lb/>
The Archbishop of <i>York</i> said:&#x2014;It is with the greatest reluctance that I, at any time, offer myself to your lordships' notice; but, my lords, there are occasions&#x2014;and, in my opinion, the present is certainly one of those occasions&#x2014;when, holding the situation which I have the honour to hold in the Church of this country, it may become my duty, almost, not to confine myself to a silent vote on the question before your lordships.&#x2014;It may seem, indeed, the more incumbent upon me to state my own feelings respecting it, as my most reverend friend, the primate of our Church&#x2014;whose sentiments on this subject I have the happiness to know accord entirely with my own&#x2014;is unhappily prevented, by severe indisposition, from attending in his place this day. That nothing but severe indisposition could have deprived the House of my most reverend friend's valuable assistance on this occasion, your lordships, who have so long witnessed the zeal and partiality which he has uniformly manifested in the discharge of his parliamentary duties will, I am persuaded, readily believe.&#x2014;It will not, however, my lords, be necessary for me to trouble your lordships, in this instance, with more than a very few words, as it is my intention to direct what I have to say to one single point.&#x2014;I have, then, my lords, no hesitation in declaring, that I feel bound, on every principle, to give my vote for the repeal of an act, which has, I fear, led, in too many instances, to the profanation of the most sacred or-

<col>1483</col>
dinance of our religion. My lords: religious tests, imposed for political purposes, must, in themselves, be always liable, more or less, to endanger religious sincerity. Nothing, therefore, but paramount necessity&#x2014;I mean some obvious and urgent danger apprehended to the state&#x2014;can, in my opinion, justify their being so imposed; and, of course, it follows that they ought to be discontinued, whenever the necessity which first called for them; shall appear no longer to exist.&#x2014;At the same time, my lords, I will venture confidently to affirm&#x2014;notwithstanding what has been asserted to the contrary by the noble baron&#x2014;I say, I will venture confidently to affirm, that these acts were originally designed, expressly and most particularly designed, for the protection of the Church of England&#x2014;that Church, therefore, my lords, has a right to claim at our hands, aye, and to expect also, if these acts are now to be repealed, that something shall be substituted for them, which shall not only avow distinctly, but secure likewise, as far as it may be possible to secure, that most important object. Whether the provisions in this bill, as they now stand, may prove sufficient for that purpose, or what amendments it may be right to make to them, will best be ascertained when the bill itself shall come into the committee&#x2014;and in the earnest hope that the measure may eventually be rendered such as to afford satisfaction to all parties, I shall give my vote for the second reading of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01355"><member>The Earl of Winchelsea</member><membercontribution> said, he thought it imperative upon their lordships to insert in this measure some clause rendering the support and maintenance of orthodoxy necessary on the part of those Dissenters who were appointed to public offices. The Church ought to be protected against the machinations of persons who avowedly professed Deism and Infidelity. It was not his intention to oppose the second reading of the bill; but when it went into a committee, he should propose such alterations in the preamble as would, in his opinion, have this effect. Was it not, he asked, right to have some provisions made against blasphemy and irreligion? He hoped that if he should have the honour to propose any such clauses, he should receive the support, not only of every friend of the Established Church, but of every real friend of civil and religious liberty. It had been repeatedly used as an argument for
<col>1484</col>
the total repeal of the Corporation and Test acts, that they were passed at a period of anticipated danger to the constitution in Church and State; that no such danger as then existed was now to be apprehended; and that therefore there was no just ground for not repealing them. But let their lordships inquire if danger of a different kind did not exist in this their day, which called for the vigilant attention of the legislature. The danger which he feared, arose from the active exertions and machinations of certain individuals, for the dissemination of blasphemous and infidel principles, striking at the root of the doctrines, not only of the Established Church, but of Christianity itself. Among the numerous instances of these demoralizing designs which might be alleged, and of which their lordships were probably aware, he needed only to call their attention to the existence of a society, which, for the last few years had, absurdly enough, denominated itself "The Society of Freethinking Christians." This society had laid a petition upon their lordships' table, which they had made a vehicle for the most bitter attacks, not only upon the Church of England, but upon Christianity itself. It was against such persons as these that their lordships were called upon to guard the constitution in Church and State. He would say in the words of the immortal Burke, "that the most horrid and cruel blow that can be offered to civil society is through Atheism and Infidelity. An infidel is an outlaw of the constitution, not only of this country, but of the human race. He is never to be supported, never to be tolerated." It was his opinion, that if their lordships did not repel the attacks, and crush the efforts of such miscreants, they would soon see their principles propagated in every direction among the people, who would be taught to scorn, as obsolete, every institution which served as prop to good government, every doctrine which was essential to the maintenance of genuine Christianity. In rejecting Christianity, as this bill at present rejected it&#x2014;for he called on the reverend bench of bishops to point out to him any clause in it which would prevent Infidelity from legislating for the country&#x2014;in rejecting Christianity he said, which had hitherto formed an integral part of the constitution, they were endangering the existence of their own liberty. In taking away the belief of a future state of existence, and of reward and
<image src="S2V0018P0I0750"/>
<col>1485</col>
punishment after death, they were striking at the sanctity of judicial oaths, they were undermining the validity of moral evidence, and they were preparing for their country the greatest and most irremediable calamities. The people would soon follow the disastrous course which had flung France into so much bloodshed and misery, and which had hitherto disabled her from enjoying that liberty for which she had dared and suffered so much. It was to prevent such a catastrophe that he now called upon the bench of bishops to stand forth manfully in defence of those doctrines which they were pledged by their holy profession to support, and to give to the country a security that, in future ages as in the past, Christianity shall in this country still be connected with the state. He would remind them of another expression of the same great statesman, whose noble sentiments he had before quoted to their lordships. That illustrious statesman had truly said, that the cause of the Church of England was included in that of Christianity, and that of Christianity in the Church of England. There was nothing but an empty appellation of security in the present bill. What security could there be for the temporalities of the Church, when Infidelity stalked through the land, and in insolent disdain cast off the mask in which it had so long arrayed itself. No one would go further than he would, to tolerate the various sects into which Christianity was divided; but to the atheist and infidel he would afford no toleration. He felt convinced that the word of God was not an empty fable, and that Christianity was not a vain boast. A Socinian, a Unitarian, and an Infidel held no opinions in common with those of the real Christian. He hoped to see some clause inserted in this bill which would give the country a security that Christianity would still be connected with the state within its dominions, and which would prevent Infidelity from being exalted to offices of high trust and importance in the empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01356"><member>The Bishop of Lincoln</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;My Lords, in expressing my concurrence in what has fallen from the most reverend prelate, I feel it necessary to advert to the origin of those laws which it is now considered expedient to repeal. I feel this to be the more necessary, because the noble baron, in urging their repeal, has dwelt at considerable length, on the circumstances in which the country was placed when they
<col>1486</col>
were first passed, on the precipitation with which they were hurried through parliament, and also on the ferment which then existed in the public mind. I do not mean to deny the general correctness of the representations of the noble lord. The Corporation act was passed at a time when the injuries which the Church of England had received from the Puritans were fresh in the recollection of men, and when the dominant party were inclined rather to consult their resentments or their fears, than the dictates of prudence and moderation. With regard to the Test act, it was passed at a time of great excitement, when the public mind had been roused to a state of frenzy by plots, and rumours of plots, against the Protestant religion, and when such was the alarm of all classes, that the Protestant Dissenters consented to their own disqualification, in order to facilitate the exclusion of the Roman Catholics from offices of trust and power. It should be recollected, however, that both these Acts were continued at the Revolution, in which the Protestant Dissenters cordially co-operated. Your lordships, therefore, cannot attribute the continuance of them, at that period, to any irritation which existed in the bosom of parliament, against the Protestant Dissenters; they were continued deliberately, and on principles of sound policy; for, combined with the Toleration act, they constituted the system by which the wise and great men of that day hoped to prevent the recurrence of those contests and animosities, which, from the time of the Reformation, had divided England against itself, on the score of religion.<lb/>
After the Reformation, the legislature was called upon to provide against a danger which had not before arisen. Up to that period, all the subjects of the state professed, or were supposed to profess, the religion of the state. No dissent from that religion was tolerated; nor, in this respect, did our first reformers contemplate any deviation from the policy of those who had gone before them. They conceived that in what they had done they had restored the Church of Christ to its primitive purity; but the outward unity of the Church was a principle maintained by them as strongly as by the Roman Catholics. They wished to make all the inhabitants of this country of one religion; the religion which they had purified from superstition and error. The
<image src="S2V0018P0I0751"/>
<col>1487</col>
circumstances of the times, however, prevented them from carrying their wishes into effect. Before the Reformation all persons had bowed, with implicit deference, to the decisions of the Church of Rome. After the Reformation, their reason was unshackled; and it was not at all surprising that many abused, at first, the liberty to which they were unused, ran into the opposite extreme, and rejected authority altogether. In our own country, numbers of persons were dissatisfied with the extent to which the Reformation had been carried. They thought that enough had not been done to purify the old religion&#x2014;they thought that every ceremony which savoured of it ought to be abolished&#x2014;and they soon evinced their determination to make the Established Church what they wished, or to subvert it. This spirit, which first showed itself under the reign of queen Elizabeth, became more visible under the feeble reign of her successor, who, though he had sagacity enough to foresee the consequences to which it was leading, had neither sufficient wisdom nor firmness to avert them. The true policy for the government of that day to pursue would have been to say to the dissatisfied party&#x2014;" We wish not to interfere with your religious opinions; we recognise the right of every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience; if he errs, he is amenable for his errors not to man but to his Maker; if, therefore, you cannot conscientiously join in the worship of the Established Church, separate yourselves from it, but separate quietly; do not disturb the peace of the community." Such was the language which, in my opinion, ought to have been held to the Puritans; but the notion to which I have alluded, respecting the necessity of maintaining the outward unity of the Church, and the prejudices of James respecting the extent of his authority, prevented it. James was determined to effect, at least, an outward conformity. He first tried what is called a Comprehension:&#x2014;he assembled the leading divines of the opposite parties at Hampton-court, in the hope of bringing them to an agreement; but, though eminently qualified, both by the natural bent of his genius, and his acquirements, to moderate in the theological schools, he soon found that he had undertaken a task far beyond his power. Foiled in his attempts at conciliation, he resorted to less gentle and less justifiable modes of
<col>1488</col>
producing Conformity, which were pursued with increased violence by the advisers of his unfortunate son, till at length the elements of religious, being mixed up with those of political, discord, a storm was raised which swept away both the Church and Throne in its fury. After the Restoration another attempt, equally ineffectual with the former, was made to reconcile the contending parties; and on its failure recourse was had, for the first time, to the policy of excluding from office all who dissented from the Established Church. This policy was continued at the Revolution, and combined, as I have already observed with the Toleration act&#x2014;by which the Dissenters obtained, what they had never before enjoyed&#x2014;legal protection in the exercise of their religion, while the security of the Church was provided for by their exclusion from political power.<lb/>
This, my lords, is, I believe, a true account of the origin of these laws; and notwithstanding all that has fallen from the noble lord, I must confess my inability to discover any injustice in their principle. If the Church is, as the preamble to this bill declares it to be, inseparably united with the State, the state is justified in enacting such laws as it deems necessary to preserve that union inviolate; and if the avowed principles of any body of men afford sufficient ground for concluding that they will employ any political power which they may obtain in attempts to disturb the union, they may without injustice be excluded from political power.<lb/>
But the noble baron says, that tests punish religious opinions, and that religious opinions cannot, without injustice, be made the subject of punishment. I am aware, my lords, that the noble baron can appeal to high authority in support of this proposition&#x2014;to the authority of his illustrious uncle; but much as I am disposed to defer to that authority, I must think that the proposition, stated thus broadly and without limitation, cannot be maintained. It is not, however, necessary for me to enter into the discussion of the abstract proposition. I contend, the intent of a Test law is not punishment: it is a measure of self-defence; and I believe that in the very case in which lord Mansfield delivered the celebrated opinion alluded to by the noble baron; the ground of the decision was, that the Corporation and Test laws were designed not as punishments, but as restraints. In
<image src="S2V0018P0I0752"/>
<col>1489</col>
providing for my own security, I may do that which operates as an inconvenience or hardship on those against whom I am guarding myself, but I cannot, with any propriety of language, be said to inflict a punishment on them.<lb/>
The noble baron urged another argument, which has frequently been used, that the Test law excludes only a conscientious Dissenter, while the man without religion takes it without scruple; but the conscientious Dissenter was the very person whom these laws were designed to exclude, for it was from the conscientious Dissenter that danger was apprehended. The statesmen who continued these laws at the Revolution, had either lived themselves, or conversed with those who had lived, at a time when men&#x2014;goaded on, I admit, by the harshest and most impolitic treatment&#x2014;succeeded in persuading themselves that they were bound in conscience to aim at the subversion of a Church, containing anything in its rites or discipline, for which an express warrant could not be found in Scripture. In proportion, therefore, to their sincerity in the opinions which they professed, was the danger to be apprehended from their admission to political power. The same reason appears to have guided the framers of these laws in the choice of the test which they adopted. They wanted a test which no conscientious Dissenter could take, and the most effectual test for their purpose was a religious test. Your lordships must not suppose that I am defending the sacramental test, I am only accounting for its selection; notwithstanding all the ingenuity which has been exerted, and never was greater ingenuity exerted, than in defence of the Sacramental test, I feel that the mind can never be thoroughly reconciled to the idea of making a participation in one of the most solemn ordinances of religion, a passport to secular office, or of holding out a worldly inducement to the performance of an act which ought to originate in purely religious feeling.<lb/>
But to turn from the origin of these laws, to the question immediately before the House, I think that a Test-law can only be justified as a measure of self-defence; as a provision against danger, and that not an imaginary danger, such as may be conjured up by the fears of timid, or the artifices of designing men, but a real danger. A mere surmise, a remote probability of danger, does not afford a suffi-
<col>1490</col>
cient reason for excluding a large body of the subjects of the realm, from eligibility to office, and thereby depriving the state of their services. It has, I think, been satisfactorily shown, that at the time when these laws were passed, the avowed principles of the Protestant Dissenters, with reference to the Church, afforded a sufficient ground for their exclusion. But the question for the consideration of your lordships is, whether that ground still continues to exist? I must confess that I am not prepared to answer the question in the affirmative. I am persuaded that the toleration which the Protestant Dissenters have enjoyed since the Revolution, has produced its natural effect, of softening the hostile feelings entertained by their ancestors against the Established Church. The angry passions which induced men to contend for a trifling rite or ceremony, with as much bitterness as if religion itself was at stake, have long since subsided; and I believe that many of those who are called orthodox Dissenters, are sincerely anxious for the preservation of the Established Church, which they regard as a powerful bulwark against the aggressions of the Church of Rome. But it may be said that although danger may not exist at present, it may arise hereafter, and that while these acts remain unrepealed, the Church possesses the means of protecting itself, by resisting the passing of the Annual Indemnity bill; but if these laws are once repealed the Church will be left entirely without protection. My lords, when the hour of danger arrives, the feeling of the legislature and the country will either be favourable to the Established Church, or adverse to it. In the former case, it will experience no difficulty in procuring the enactment of laws necessary for its protection; in the latter, it will in vain attempt to resist the passing of the Annual Indemnity bill. The truth is, the principle of these laws was exclusion; that principle we have long since abandoned in practice either because we were unable, or because we saw no necessity, to maintain it; and, though I attach little importance to the Declaration contained in the present bill, as a security, I think it at least as effectual as the mere existence upon the Statute-book of laws which, from year to year, we regularly suspend.<lb/>
In the remarks which I have addressed to your lordships, I have confined myself to that which I deem the real question
<image src="S2V0018P0I0753"/>
<col>1491</col>
before the House: the expediency or inexpediency of repealing the Sacramental Test. With respect to the Declaration, I have already said I attach but little importance to it as a security; but, if the bill pass into a committee, I hope that some endeavour will be made to ascertain more precisely the description of offices, the holders of which shall be required to make that Declaration. It is my conviction, as firmly as it can be that of the noble earl who spoke last, that the cause of religion in this country is intimately blended with the safety of the Established Church. I am aware that such a declaration, proceeding from a member of the order to which I belong, exposes him who makes it to the invidious remark, either that he is positively actuated by interested motives; or that at least his interest biasses his judgment, and that his opinions are consequently entitled to little weight; tout, feeling this conviction, I should feel it my bounden duty to resist the repeal of the Sacramental Test if I thought that the safety of the Church of England would be compromised by the repeal. I entertain no such apprehension; the best security of the Church of England is the hold which it possesses on the esteem and affections of the people. The legislature may, undoubtedly, contribute essentially to its stability and well-being; not, however, by throwing around it the external fences of restrictive laws, but by defining more accurately the privileges which belong to it as an Established Church, by improving its internal polity, and by providing it with less expensive and less circuitous modes of administering its discipline.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01357"><member>The Bishop of Durham</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;My lords, on a question of such a kind, and of such importance to the great interests of Church and State, as that which is now before us; your lordships will probably not be surprised that more than one of the episcopal bench should be desirous of offering their opinions; and although much of what I might have been disposed to say, has been anticipated by the most reverend prelate who spoke earlier in the debate, and by the right reverend prelate who has just sat down, yet, considering not only the magnitude of the question itself, but the manner in which it has been treated, both in and out of parliament, by its advocates on the one hand, and its opponents on the other, I cannot but feel
<col>1492</col>
anxious briefly to state to your lordships the grounds and reasons of the vote I intend to give.<lb/>
My lords; I have laboured with great earnestness and sincerity, to satisfy myself that the measure now proposed may be acceded to, with safety and with credit to the Established Church. And I should have had less difficulty in bringing myself to that persuasion (as at length I have done) had not some of the advocates of the Dissenters, and the Dissenters themselves, in their petitions to parliament, and other accredited documents, grounded their pretensions upon certain abstract rights, to which I cannot possibly accede. It has been assumed that it is a natural, inherent, and inalienable right, belonging to every member of the community, to be deemed eligible to offices of trust and power in the State, without regard to his religious opinions, and even if his opinions be diametrically opposite to those which the State has adopted as its own. Such a principle as this can only be admissible in some state of society wholly different from that in which we are placed; in some imaginary state, some Utopian commonwealth, or, rather, in some state antecedent to the formation of any regular government whatsoever. In a state like ours, where for ages, there has subsisted an established mode of government, founded upon principles altogether opposite to these notions, I conceive that all such reasoning on them is misplaced and irrelevant; nor can it be necessary on this occasion to attempt to refute them. In themselves, I hold them to be altogether fallacious and visionary; and if they were ever to be advanced in this House as fit topics of discussion, I should be ready to encounter them. But, at present, they need not be even taken into consideration; nor shall I waste either your lordships' time or my own, with any further notice of them. Any trouble of this kind is indeed spared (and I am glad that it is so) by the very bill itself now brought before us; the preamble to which distinctly and unequivocally recognises the true and only sound principle, on which the whole discussion should rest. The preamble sets forth, that the Protestant Episcopal Church of England is established permanently and inviolably. This is the principle which I mean, therefore, to assume in the present inquiry. I ask no more, and I can be content with nothing less.<lb/>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0754"/>
<col>1493</col>
It is impossible, however, my lords, to separate this question from historical evidence. But my right reverend friend has gone so fully into this part of the subject, that I need not do more than take a very general and cursory view of it. It will be sufficient to remind your lordships (and it is the one main point on which I would insist), that the history of our country clearly shows the connexion between religion and government, the inseparable alliance between church and state, to have been the fundamental basis of our political constitution, from its earliest periods&#x2014;certainly, ever since we have been a Christian community. Your lordships well know what was the state of the case from the sixth to the sixteenth century, during the domination of papal power. I need not enumerate the statutes against heresy during that period, nor the various coercive measures adopted, to prevent any one from moving even his little finger against the authority of the Church of Rome&#x2014;measures and enactments somewhat more oppressive than mere exclusion from offices of trust and power. Thank God those times are past; but we may be thankful, also, that those who liberated this country from such tyranny and oppression, did not, in so doing, discard religion from its place, nor separate it from its union with the State. It was the glory of the Protestant Reformation in this country, or rather, I should say, it was its peculiar felicity, providentially so, that it was enabled to preserve the Church entire, and to maintain its connexion with the State, by uniting both under one supreme head&#x2014;the sovereign of the realm. In this respect, few, if any, of the foreign churches that embraced the Reformation experienced the same advantages. These advantages, my lords, might have been continued, by the exclusion of Papists only from office, had not dissatisfied and turbulent spirits arisen between that period and the Restoration, by whom the Church and the monarchy were overthrown. On the Restoration, it was found necessary to exclude these also. Thence arose the Test-laws, which, whether or not they were, in the first instance, directed chiefly against the Papists, were certainly, afterwards, by the Toleration act, applied to the exclusion of Protestant Dissenters also. At the Revolution, the great statesmen who placed king William on the throne, found
<col>1494</col>
it necessary to renew and re-establish the connexion between the Protestant Episcopal Church and the State, and to determine that such connexion should be permanent and inviolable; not only to ward off present and immediate dangers, but effectually to guard against the recurrence of such evils as had been, for so long a time, experienced.<lb/>
It appears then, my lords, that these acts, now so much spoken against, originated really in state-necessity, using that term in its proper and most favourable acceptation. They were, in truth, measures of self-defence&#x2014;defence, that is, of the constitution itself, and, consequently, of the best interests of the whole community. And thus matters have continued to the present day. The Established Church is still an integral part of the constitution, and under this system our country has attained to the highest degree of national prosperity. Nor is it difficult to discern why our Protestant Episcopal Establishment has obtained this preference and ascendancy; experience having amply proved, that it is, of all others, the best adapted to the political form of government with which it is united, and best harmonizes with all its civil institutions.<lb/>
Upon this principle, my lords, it is evident that the Test-laws were founded. From the evils that had been experienced, both before and after the Reformation, it was deemed necessary to confine offices of power and trust to members of the Established Church. And this being determined upon, the Sacramental test was resorted to, simply, as the most direct and unequivocal evidence of church-membership. There was, evidently, no intention to compel any man to take the Sacrament against his conscience. But it was conceived, that every person in communion with the Church, must be in the habit of performing that duty, and could have no difficulty or scruple in complying with it. And when viewed simply in this light, I own I cannot regard it as deserving of all that obloquy and vituperation that have been cast upon it. I have no great partiality, my lords, for this particular test; but I cannot help saying thus much, to rescue from unmerited and unmeasured reproach, some of the greatest and best men who have vindicated this, now so obnoxious, measure. My lords, when I find such men as Bishop Sherlock, with a host of others, only lesser luminaries than him
<image src="S2V0018P0I0755"/>
<col>1495</col>
self, coming forward in its defence, I am inclined to pause before I join in ascribing to it all the profanation and impiety which have been charged upon it. And whoever reads the masterly tract of Bishop Sherlock upon the subject, will find that, in his defence of it, not a trace can be discovered of irreverence towards that solemn and sacred ordinance. Yet, my lords, as I have just said, I am not disposed to uphold the use of this ordinance for such; purposes. Were it only used by persons in communion with our Church, or by persons accustomed to use it, independently of any secular object, no profanation, perhaps, could fairly be charged upon it; and I should be at a loss to perceive the harm of merely producing a certificate that it had been so performed. But this is, evidently, no longer the case. It is no longer a decisive proof of church-membership, nor, indeed, was it ever entirely so, since there were many conscientious Dissenters, in former times, who did not object to receiving this Sacrament in our Church. We know, also, that it is continually taken (if at all), merely as a qualification for office; and, not unfrequently, it is to be feared, under circumstances that indicate even an intentional desecration of it. Its continuance, therefore, certainly may give occasion to scandal and offence; and I believe a great majority of our own clergy feel this so strongly, as to be far from disinclined to abandon it, and to provide some less exceptionable substitute in its stead.<lb/>
The substitute, my lords, proposed in this bill, is a political, instead of a religious, test&#x2014;not proving church-membership, but disclaiming hostility to the Church. Its primary object, however, is the same&#x2014;that of giving security against injury or molestation to the established religion of the State; which is to be done by a prescribed form of words, instead of a religious rite. How far the Declaration, as it now stands, may be deemed sufficient for that purpose, or what other previsions or amendments in the bill may be desirable for carrying it more completely into effect, may be points for consideration when the bill goes into a committee. At present, my lords, I confess, the greatest security I look to in the bill is that which is contained in its preamble. So distinct and positive an affirmation, by the two Houses of Parliament, and, eventually, by the Sovereign himself (should this bill pass
<col>1496</col>
into a law), that our Protestant Episcopal Church is established permanently and inviolably, cannot, I should hope, but have its due weight upon the public mind. It will show that, in the view and intention of the legislature, this union of the Church with the State, as an integral part of the constitution of the realm, is not to be disturbed. I conceive, also, that the Declaration itself, to be taken by the parties concerned, ought, in fair construction, to be understood, in connexion with the preamble, as pledging the individual to an acquiescence in that acknowledgment.<lb/>
My Lords; I have made these observations, from the anxious desire of not being considered, by my concurrence in this measure, as compromising this great and fundamental principle. And I am the more anxious in this respect, from a firm conviction that, under Providence, the Church of England is, at this moment, and has been, ever since the Reformation, one of the strongest bulwarks of pure Christianity, not only in this country, but throughout the Christian world. But, in claiming thus much for our national church, I do not mean to disparage or depreciate the pretensions of those who separate from us. I cannot forget what obligations we owe to them in literature, in arts and sciences, in religion, in biblical criticism, and even in government itself. No one can more willingly recognise these services than I do. Many such there have been among them, and many such, I trust, there still are. Yet, I persuade myself, that such men, when not under the influence of agitators unlike themselves, will be most ready to allow the necessity of upholding that fabric of civil and ecclesiastical polity which has so long subsisted among us, even for their own sakes. They cannot be so unread in the history of our own country, as not to know the evils that ensued on the overthrow of our church and monarchy, during the Commonwealth. They cannot but know, that when, on that overthrow, a struggle took place for the ascendancy, the party that first prevailed denied toleration to the rest: and the party that next succeeded were still more intolerant than their predecessors. I could mention to your lordships innumerable publications, in those times, written expressly against toleration and religious liberty. And what could be expected now, if our present establishments were subverted? Under which of the several parties that might
<image src="S2V0018P0I0756"/>

My Lords; I will not trouble your lordships with further observations, having been only desirous to express my own strong feelings, as to the necessity of upholding, permanently and inviolably, our long established and venerable institutions in church and state, and the reasons which induce me to concur in the second reading of the present bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01358"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> said, he did not think it consistent with his sense of the importance of the question before their lordships to give a silent vote upon it. To him it was most painful to witness what labour had been used by some persons to resist the principle that the Established Church was inseparable from the State, and that it was impossible to destroy the connection between the Church and State without destroying the constitution. The Roman Catholics were in the habit of saying, that they were unjustly deprived of the benefits of the constitution. Now, if they would say that their object was to secure the benefits of the constitution, and not to alter that constitution, he would come to issue with them on that point. It gave him particular satisfaction to think, that in opposing the repeal of the Corporation and Test acts, he was supporting the original intention of their enactment. Their lordships had learned, that though this measure was at first manfully opposed in the other House, yet those who had done so had ultimately acquiesced in it. To be sure there was a strong majority in its favour; but then, though there might be some elsewhere who thought it consistent with their own interests to give up the interests of the State, and that against their own opinions and in compliance with the opinions of a majority, that was no reason why he or their lordships, should yield up their opinion to the majority of the other House of parliament; on the contrary, he felt it to be his duty, and that of any other peer, to act on their own conscientious conviction and even though they should have a majority of their lordships' House against them. He had heard much of the march of mind and the progress of information, and of persons changing opinions which they had held for years; but he did not think it possible that the march of
<col>1498</col>
mind could have been so speedy as to induce some of the changes of opinions which he had witnessed within the last year; least of all did he expect that such a bill as that proposed would have ever been received into their lordships' House, even under the idea of making amendments on it. The bill was said to stand on the principle set forth in its preamble. But what was that principle? Why that it was expedient&#x2014;"expedient" &#x0021;&#x2014;a word used by those who had nothing else to say. But their lordships ought not to be satisfied with the bare assertion that such a measure was expedient. They ought to take care that the provisions of the bill proved the expediency of it. Then, looking at the provisions, they contained no such proof; for, as to the Declaration, it would be more consistent to bring in a bill at once for the unqualified repeal of the Test-laws, than this bill, every clause of which militated against the constitution. But what was it expedient to do? To repeal the Sacramental Test. Now, if it could be shown to him that the intended substitute for that test was a sufficient security for the Church, it would be all right, and he would require nothing more; but he must say that he had never heard greater misrepresentations on any subject than on the Sacramental test. But to go to the other clauses of the bill, the next ran thus:&#x2014;" Whereas, the Protestant Church of these realms, is established and inviolate." How? By the existing laws. If thus the existing laws constituted the defence, and contributed to the inviolability of the Church, surely the repealing of those laws could not be the way to keep that Church established by law; nor was the removal of her defences the way to preserve her inviolate. Then, as to the proof that the Declaration was a sufficient defence in place of the Test-laws, he believed it was required by the existing law of persons taking offices in the Universities of Scotland, to make a sort of confession of faith; but he was sure that, some of those learned and reverend persons must have found considerable difficulty in making that confession of faith, when he remembered the opinions they acknowledged in their petitions on this question. But what was the substitute for the Sacramental test? A simple Declaration. Instead of making the taker of office describe himself as belonging to some sort of religion&#x2014;whe-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0757"/>
<col>1499</col>
ther a Unitarian, a Catholic, or a Freethinker, it did not require him even to say&#x2014;he had only to answer, that he was of the Christian faith; neither did it call on him to observe the Declaration by such phrases as "lam a Christian," or "as I stand in the presence of my God." The confidence to be reposed in the proposed Declaration did not rest upon the faith of the Christian, or on the confession of any faith whatever.&#x2014;He had never been more surprised than when he heard the noble lord who opened the debate, inform their lordships that while the Declaration was to be extended, not merely to corporate offices, but to all offices of trust and emolument under the Crown, the bill left it entirely to the king to say, with respect to these latter functionaries, whether his majesty would require such a Declaration or not. He could not but object to the provisions of such a bill, the object of which was, to take away the Sacramental Test, merely on the ground of "expediency," and to substitute in its place a Declaration, which, in some instances, might or might not be taken, according to the will of the sovereign. The principle of the proposed law went to destroy the Sacramental Test for the purpose of substituting this Declaration, and unless their lordships approved of that substitution, they ought not to consent to the second reading of the bill. He differed extremely from all he had read and heard respecting the propriety of omitting to maintain that great principle of the constitution; namely that the Church of England was not an establishment erected for mere purposes of convenience, but was essentially and inseparably a part of the state. The Sacramental test was well calculated to effect that great object, and it signified not what they substituted for it, so long as what was substituted was of inferior efficacy. Further, he maintained that, in compliance with our existing constitution, the Church of England must be supported; and could best be supported by the admission of only its own members to offices of trust and emolument. Such had been the principle of the constitution of this country for ages. Their lordships should take good care that they did not disunite those whom the constitution had joined together; and if they did any thing towards disjoining them, they should be equally careful to use some sort of cement, and enable the Church and
<col>1500</col>
State Establishments to protect each other by mutual service and support. The ground of expediency set forth in the preamble to that bill he could not help thinking afforded a low principle on which to legislate. He objected to the repeal of laws hitherto preserved with so much anxiety and care as the Corporation and Test acts. The Corporation Act did not require any man to take the sacrament. He meant, it did not impose upon him that duty against his inclination: it only said, "you shall not be elected a member of a corporation, except, in the twelve months antecedent to your application for office, you shall have received the sacrament." The fact was, its provisions were directed towards members of the Church of England, and to them originally was the act intended to apply. The Test Act required the taking of the Sacrament on the acceptance of office. The inference was, that if such provisions for the security of the Church had not been necessary they would not have been made. He supposed no noble lord would maintain that it was not desirable to have an Established Church; and he was prepared to contend, that the necessary effect of the proposed enactment must be to weaken its foundation, and consequently to militate against its permanency. He would venture to say, if noble lords would read the petitions presented to parliament on this subject, they would hardly find a single sentence in one of them which their lordships would be willing to affirm in the preamble of an act of parliament like the present. Those petitions evinced hostility towards the Established Church, at the same time that they denounced all religious Tests as pernicious. On referring to one of them, he found it affirmed that the Church of England, had its foundation in Rome&#x2014;that it derived its origin from Heathenism and Popery&#x2014;and that it wielded the sword of persecution; together with other statements of a similar nature.<lb/>
The sentiments contained in the petitions were so extravagant that perhaps they were not deserving of attention. But he looked to the sober principle involved in the present measure. It was said, that the Corporation Act was originally directed against the Sectaries&#x2014;the Test-act against the Papists: that the Test-act had never been intended to operate against the Dissenters; yet it did happen that both acts operated against
<image src="S2V0018P0I0758"/>
<col>1501</col>
them. In the reign of Charles 2nd. the act related to the Dissenters; but when they came to the Toleration act, there was no doubt that the Test and Corporation act was directed against both. He alluded to the law passed in the reign of William 3rd; from which it was evident, that the acts referred to had been directed both against Dissenters and Papists. They went on in silent operation until the reign of George 2nd, when the act of indemnity was passed. The legislature passed act after act to enlarge the time for taking the Test. It was evident that parliament was anxious to have it taken; and with a view of accomplishing its object, it extended the time within which persons holding office could comply with the law. It had been said, that it was an extraordinary thing to go on passing Indemnity acts year after year, instead of at once abolishing the law which they were intended for the time to supersede. However, he maintained that those Indemnity acts, passed year by year, were neither more nor less than acknowledgments and recognitions on the part of the legislature, that the Corporation and Test-acts ought not to be dispensed with. He desired to know whether the passing of these acts from year to year, was not rather confirmatory of the opinion of parliament that the law should not be repealed, than that it ought to be abolished? Forty years ago, in consequence of his firm conviction of their propriety, be had voted against the repeal of these acts. He had thus voted at a time when a great many noble lords whom he then saw around him, were not born; and he might say the same of some of the reverend Prelates who now supported the measure before their lordships. In 1787, the question was brought forward in the other House, and was rejected by a majority of that House. In 1789, the question was again discussed, when the majority against it was 20; but in 1790, on its being once more introduced, its opponents out-numbered its supporters by 187. The question had not since been brought forward until the present occasion. The majority by which it was rejected in 1790 was not extraordinary, when it was considered that its opponents, who then constituted the supporters of our happy establishment, found that mines had been laid under the Established Church, which only waited for the match to explode them. If any joy could be felt at the unfortunate
<col>1502</col>
events that occurred in other countries about that period, it arose from the consideration, that those events rendered Englishmen more alive to the attempts made to disjoin the Church and State; and, accordingly, the parliament of that day voted to prevent the destruction of the alliance which had hitherto subsisted between our establishments. What was to prevent Corporations from being made up entirely of members of the Church of Rome if nothing more than the Declaration now suggested was required? He had examined the question deliberately, and in detail, for the purpose of ascertaining whether he had been wrong or not. The result of his investigation was, that he had been right; and he could not, therefore, consent to give up the constitution, as well as the Church Establishment, to the extent that the present bill proposed. He could not do this: it must be the work of others. Be they within or without the Church it mattered not to him. His prayer to God was, that the individuals who promoted this measure might have afterwards the satisfaction of thinking, that as they had intended no mischief to the Church, no mischief had ensued. But at the same time, that he gave them credit for sincerity, he claimed a similar allowance for himself, when he solemnly said, as he then did from his heart and soul, "Not-Content" to the present bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01359"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;I did not mean to trouble your lordships with my opinions on the present measure in this stage of the proceedings, and I should have reserved what I intended to offer for a future opportunity, had it not been for the statements of my noble and learned friend, relative to the line of conduct adopted by government, when the present bill was first brought forward in the other House. It is certainly true, that my right hon. friends in the other House did oppose the bill when it was first introduced to their notice: and the principle on which they opposed it was, that although they did not approve entirely of the existing law on the subject, they had found it to conduce so much to the advantage of Church and State, without impairing the religious peace of the country&#x2014;a peace which has been enjoyed by this country in a greater degree than by any other&#x2014;that they conceived we might risk the loss of our present advantages, if the system under which those advantages had been
<image src="S2V0018P0I0759"/>
<col>1503</col>
attained and preserved should be inconsiderately abrogated. That principle it was on which they opposed the bill in the first instance. Afterwards, however, on finding that a large majority of the House of Commons agreed to the bill, and that many who opposed it, opposed it on grounds not applicable to the measure now before your lordships, my right hon. friends adopted the measure with an amendment, which, in their opinion, afforded ample security to the Church, at the same time that the bill itself as modified, appeared to be calculated, so far from impairing, to improve the religious peace which this country has so long enjoyed. On that principle it was, that the measure, which had been originally opposed by my right hon. friends connected with government in the other House, afterwards received their concurrence and support. I fully agree with my noble friend, that the security of the Church of England, and the union existing between it and the State, depend neither on the law about to be repealed by the present bill, nor upon the provisions of this measure itself. That union and security, which we must all desire to see continued, depend upon the oath taken by his majesty, to which we are all, in our respective stations, parties, and not only on that oath, but on the act of Settlement, and the different acts of union from time to time agreed to; all of which provide for the intimate and inseparable union of Church and State, and for the security of both. The question we have to consider is, what security does the existing system of laws as they now stand, afford the Church Establishment. My lords, I am very dubious as to the amount of security afforded through the means of a system of exclusion from office, to be carried into effect by a law which it is necessary to suspend by an annual act, that admits every man into office whom it was the intention of the original framers of that law to exclude. It is perfectly true, it was not the intention of those who brought in that Suspension-law originally, that Dissenters from the Church of England should be permitted to enter into corporations under its provisions. The law was intended to relieve those whom time or circumstances had rendered unable to qualify themselves according to the system which government devised. It has also been said, that the Dissenters availed themselves of the relaxation of the law for
<col>1504</col>
the purpose of getting into corporations; and this the law allowed. What security then, I ask, my lords, is to be found in the existing system? So far from Dissenters being excluded by the Corporation and Test acts from all corporations&#x2014;so far is this from being the fact&#x2014;that some corporations are absolutely and entirely in the possession of Dissenters. Can you suppose, my lords, that the repeal of laws so inoperative as these can afford any serious obstacle to the perfect security of the Church, and the permanent union of that establishment with the State? The fact is, that the existing laws have not only failed completely in answering their intended purpose, but are anomalous and absurd&#x2014;anomalous in their origin, absurd in their operation. If a man were asked the question, on his election to any corporate office, whether he had received the Sacrament of the Church of England, and he said "No," then he lost every vote that had been tendered on his behalf, and there was an end of his election; but if, on the contrary, by accident or design he got in without the question relative to the Sacrament being put to him, then the votes tendered for him were held good, and his election valid; so that no power could remove him from the office which he held. I ask my noble and learned friend, is there any security in that? My noble and learned friend says, that the original intention of the framers of these acts was, that the Sacrament should not be taken by Dissenters; but the law requires that a man, on entering into any corporation, shall receive the Sacrament without regard to his religious belief. Thus, my lords, an individual whose object it is to get into a particular office, may feel disposed, naturally enough, to take the Sacrament before his election, merely as a matter of form, and thus a sacred rite of our Church is prostituted to a shameful and scandalous purpose. I confess, my lords, I should have opposed this bill if I thought it calculated to weaken the securities at present enjoyed by the Church. I consider the opposition offered in the first instance, by my right hon. friends in the other House of Parliament, as arising out of a desire to preserve the religious peace of the country, at the same time that they secured the integrity of the Establishment. My right hon. friends at first contemplated the existing system as having given religious peace to this country for forty
<image src="S2V0018P0I0760"/>
<col>1505</col>
years. I repeat that, during forty years, that peace has never been disturbed, nor the question which is now before your lordships agitated. But, my lords, the subject of security and of religious peace was fully discussed in the other House, through which the bill before your lordships was carried by a large majority, and it now comes before your lordships and is opposed by a small minority here. Under these circumstances, I conceive that the present measure comes before you with no trifling recommendations. You have had petitions from many parishes in this kingdom, and from various societies of professing Christians, all tending to shew that religious rancour and animosity can alone be generated by a perseverance in the present system, and that their contraries may be expected to arise out of a departure from it. To these sentiments I think it is our duty to consent, taking the chance for religious peace which the majority of the House of Commons consider as likely to arise, and to be continued, out of the present measure, conjoined with some degree of security&#x2014;perhaps all the security necessary&#x2014;offered to the Church. I, therefore, think it advisable to entertain the proposition submitted to you by the noble lord. By agreeing to it, you will attain the advantages to which I have alluded, at the same time, that you will ensure a security fully equivalent to the security, if security I may call it, which your lordships are about to repeal, by agreeing to the bill now before you.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01360"><member>Lord Goderich</member><membercontribution> said, that after the able, eloquent, and perfectly satisfactory, speech of the noble mover, and after the sentiments which their lordships had heard from several right reverend prelates&#x2014;sentiments which did no less honour to themselves than to the assembly to which they were addressed, and the Church to which they belonged&#x2014;it would ill become him to go at large into the general arguments which might be adduced in favour of the second reading of the bill. He felt great satisfaction at the opinion expressed by the noble duke at the head of his majesty's government, and the commencement of his intention to support the measure, which it might have been the original purpose of government to oppose. Little was he, who was favourable to the bill then before their lordships, disposed to quarrel with the determination of government. Of one thing he felt confident, that if his
<col>1506</col>
majesty's ministers considered the repeal of the existing acts calculated to endanger the Church, or to put in hazard its union with the State, they never would support it. If he could bring himself to think that the proposed measure would, in any degree, shake the foundation on which the Church of England stood, he would be ready to fight side by side with the noble and learned lord, and to support him to the uttermost: for he fully concurred with him in considering, that the union subsisting between Church and State could never be violated with impunity, and he trusted in God it would always prove inviolable. He thought the present measure supported by many and urgent motives; not the least of which was, that it would have the effect of removing much religious difference and animosity which at present existed; at the same time, that, so far from weakening the Church, it would conciliate a great, number of individuals in her favour. These, in his mind, were sufficient reasons for passing the bill. He could not bring himself to think with the noble and learned lord, that because in the preamble nothing was set forth but its expediency, it ought not to pass. He admitted that it had been customary, in former times, to assign the grounds for the adoption of a particular measure, in the preamble of the bill which was to carry it into effect, and perhaps that was not an unwise practice. It afforded some historical information, at the same time that it assigned the reasons for the adoption of the particular measure. However, the custom had of late years fallen into disuse, and a general expression of the expediency of the measure was resorted to. He could never concede that an individual was prevented from voting on a law, because the grounds of its enactment were not distinctly stated in the preamble, provided he was convinced that the law was a wise one. The reason why he thought it expedient to abrogate the present law was, because he felt that it was frequently conducive to a profanation of religion, by imposing the necessity of taking a Sacramental Test for temporal purposes. He could not believe the present acts to be consistent with a right Christian feeling of the nature and object of the Sacrament. One thing might be said in its favour, that the existing system was not frequently called into operation: but that was no argument for its continuance, for, if in-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0761"/>
<col>1507</col>
operative, it was idle to maintain it. Though many noble lords had, doubtless, held various public offices, few had ever been called on to qualify themselves for office, by complying with the Sacramental Test. He himself had never been so called oil to qualify, except when he was appointed chancellor bf the Exchequer. And why then, he could not tell, except, perhaps, that the chancellorship of the Exchequer was a very dangerous office. Soon after he had been nominated, he was told that it was absolutely necessary that he should, upon a certain Sunday, in a certain church, qualify himself for retaining office by taking the Sacrament. God knew he had not the smallest objection to do that; but it so happened, that he had received it shortly before his appointment, and he naturally said to his informant, "Won't that do?" But the answer was, "Oh &#x0021; no, not at all, by no means." He complied, and to the church on the day intimated he proceeded, for the purpose of receiving the Sacrament; and he would say it was one of the most painful duties he had ever been called upon to perform, considering its object, and combining, as it did, two duties, of the combination of which he could not approve. Suppose he had refused&#x2014;suppose he could not have made up his mind to mix together temporal and religious duties&#x2014;or suppose he had been a rigid Presbyterian&#x2014;he should be curious to know what the noble and learned lord would have said to him when he went before him to take the oaths necessary to be taken previous to acting as chancellor of the Exchequer. The law required, before he could exercise the office of chancellor of the Exchequer, that he should take the oaths, either in the court of Chancery; the court of Exchequer, or before the Sessions, and that he should produce a certificate of having taken the Sacrament according to the Church of England. If, trusting to the bill of Indemnity, he had not taken the Sacrament, and his noble and his learned friend had not asked the question, he might have fulfilled the duties of his office; but if his noble and learned friend had asked the question, he could not have been allowed to take the oaths, and he could not have held the office. He mentioned this to show that the Test act imposed a painful sacrifice even on the members of the Church of England, without any adequate benefit to the public, or
<col>1508</col>
adding to the security of the Church. He thought this bill ought to pass; and if it did, he saw in it no reasonable ground for alarm. If the bill passed, the Church of England would present the magnificent spectacle of a Church strong in the purity of its doctrine&#x2014;strong in the affections and attachment of the great majority of the people&#x2014;strong in its connection with the State&#x2014;strong in its wealth, to which it had as much right as their lordships had to their estates; but, above all, strong in its faith and its discipline, subsisting in its own strength, unprotected by restrictions, and unimpaired by exclusions; and long, he would say, might it flourish, dispensing its blessings over the country, and preserving its faith and its discipline for the benefit of those who received its succour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01361"><member>The Bishop of Chester</member><membercontribution> said:&#x2014;My lords, I should not trespass upon your lordships' patience at this late hour, were it not that I feel it to be my duty, as a prelate of the Established Church, and as a member of the legislature, to assign to the public, and particularly to that part of it with which, by my station in the Church, I happen to be more immediately connected, my reasons for adopting the course which I think it necessary to take in relation to the subject now under your lordships' consideration.<lb/>
My lords, although I am fully prepared to Concur in the present measure&#x2014;and I do most cordially and unequivocally concur in it&#x2014;yet I should be extremely sorry if, by giving a silent Vote, I should be considered as acquiescing in the censure which has been passed upon the acts in question, upon the persons with whom they originated, and those by whom they have been since defended and maintained. I find it impossible to give my consent to the measure, without protesting against the doctrine, that the laws which this measure is intended in part to repeal, and the persons who procured their enactment, are to be branded with the imputation of intolerance. The Corporation and Test acts have been repeatedly characterized as odious and unjustifiable restraints on religious liberty and civil rights, equally opposed to the plainest principles of toleration and the soundest maxims of good government.<lb/>
My lords, it is not my wish, on the present occasion, to go into a discussion of general principles. If it be assumed as a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0762"/>
<col>1509</col>
postulate, that the general good of the community requires the maintenance of an Established Church, it is obvious that the legislature is bound to extend to it that kind and degree of protection which is necessary for its security. And if there be any description of persons in the state who hold themselves bound in conscience, or at least are of necessity disposed, to do all in their power to subvert that establishment, I maintain that the state has a right to exclude them from such offices as might confer upon them the power of injuring the Church;&#x2014;it being a principle universally acknowledged, and acted upon to a great extent in the institutions of this free country, that the civil rights of subjects may be circumscribed and limited, for the general good. And it is extremely inaccurate, not to say disingenuous and unfair, to describe such limitation, as a stigma affixed by intolerance to the profession of certain religious opinions. The opinions themselves may be perfectly true; and those who profess them may be thoroughly sincere: yet as long as those opinions render their professors disaffected towards the Church Establishment, which the public good requires to be maintained&#x2014;so long may they be considered to disqualify them from certain offices. It is not a whit more unjust to exclude a man from office on account of his moral or intellectual peculiarities, than it is to exclude him from physical incapacity, or to deprive him of the right of choosing his representative, because he is not possessed of a certain amount of property.<lb/>
If the experience of the middle part of the seventeenth century had made it apparent, that the indiscriminate admission of non-conformists to offices of power and trust, was incompatible with the safety of the Church, the legislature was justified in restricting a right, the conditions of exercising which, every legislature must reserve to itself the power of prescribing. As reference has been made to the sentiments of the House of Commons on the subject now under consideration, I wish, my lords, to direct your attention to the observations made by the Lords, in their conference with the Commons, when the bill for preventing Occasional Conformity was discussed. The Lords, at that time, took the liberal side of the question, and defended the principles of Toleration in opposition to the more vehement Commons. Yet the managers of that con-
<col>1510</col>
ference, though liberal to a certain extent, did not compromise nor relinquish that principle of protection, which, if it be once lost sight of, or neglected, the safety of all our establishments, my lords, must hang upon a thread. The same persons who declared, that the greatest misfortune which could befal a man was, to be placed in a state of incapacity to serve his sovereign, made also the following declaration; "The Lords look on the fixing of qualifications for places of trust, to be a thing so entirely lodged with the legislature, that without giving any reason for it, upon any apprehension of danger, how remote soever, every government may put such rules, restraints, or conditions, on all who serve in any place of trust, as they shall see cause for."<sup>*</sup> I am not prepared, my lords, to go quite so far as this; for I agree with my right rev. friend, that there must be an urgent, and undoubted case of necessity and danger, to justify a legislature in the adoption of severe, restrictive measures. It was therefore not the Church, which stigmatized the Dissenters in their character of religionists; but it was the legislature, which, having determined, for the sake of the general good, to protect and uphold the Church, said to the Dissenters we are persuaded, and the experience of the last thirty years has proved to us, that you are bent upon destroying the Establishment; we cannot, therefore, in justice to ourselves and to the state, admit you into offices, which will give you the power of accomplishing your designs.<lb/>
But, my lords, when I maintain that our ancestors were justified in excluding non-conformists from offices of power and trust, I maintain it only on the supposition of their being convinced, on reasonable grounds, that no measure, short of exclusion, would secure the constitution from danger. For, undoubtedly, when we assert that a restraint, upon the civil rights of subjects is justifiable, we must be understood to mean the lowest degree of restraint, which is adequate to the demands of public expediency.<lb/>
In point of fact, the Corporation and Test acts have not answered the purpose of absolute exclusion, except against the Roman Catholics, and not even against them under the government of a popish king. The more moderate Non-conformists do not consider a single act of communion
<quote><sup>*</sup> Parliamentary History, vol. vi. p. 81.</quote>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0763"/>
<col>1511</col>
with the Established Church as separating them from their own sect, or affording an infallible mark of connection with us. Accordingly, many of them have, at all times conformed to the provisions of the Test act. However, my lords, I admit that the effect of the Sacramental Test has been, to alienate more completely from the Church the most conscientious of the Dissenters. That conformity, at which they did not scruple, as an evidence of Christian charity, they revolted from as a means of obtaining office. The less scrupulous among the Dissenters do not object to occasional conformity; and thus find it an easy matter to evade the provisions of the law.<lb/>
But in point of fact, it is of little consequence to inquire whether or no these laws answered their exclusive purpose for the first fifty or sixty years after their enactment. During the last eighty years the passing of an annual Indemnity bill has afforded every facility that could be desired for accepting office, to those who do not regard as sinful, all communion with our Church. Many have qualified for office, and many more have taken office without qualifying at all, under cover of the Indemnity acts; at the same time, I am aware, that these acts were intended rather to protect the careless Churchman, who neglected to qualify, than the artful Dissenter who purposely omitted so to do. What the case may be in other corporations, I know not; but I believe that, in the corporation of London, although the aldermen may qualify, it is not usual for the members of the Common Council to do so. I, therefore, confess I am quite ready to give up a security which has long ceased to be exclusive in its operation, and which, except in so far as it is exclusive, is no security at all. My lords, I wish the bill to pass, if for no other reason, yet for this&#x2014;because the present laws do not answer their purpose. If it be indispensable to the safety of the Church to retain a test, I cordially concur in all that has been said against employing the sacrament for this purpose.<lb/>
I object to the adoption of the Sacramental Test on higher grounds than those of mere political expediency. I know all that can be said in its behalf. I know that it is required merely as an evidence of Church membership; and that it is an evidence, which every member of the Church is bound to exhibit to the Christian world, whether he

take office or not. I know that, as the State commands no man to take upon him an office of power or trust, so it compels no man to receive the Holy Sacrament, who is unfit to be a partaker of it; and that he who receives it unworthily, does so at his own peril, in defiance of the warnings and admonitions of the Church. But, my lords, in all questions of this nature it becomes necessary to look at the practical effects resulting from the adoption of a particular system. In the present state of the Christian world, it is impossible to deny, that a test of this description leads directly to a profanation and abuse of the most holy ordinance of our religion; I have no hesitation in saying, that the Test act, which compels the clergy of our Church to administer the Holy Sacrament to persons, whom by the spirit, if not the letter of their ministerial instructions they may be directed to repel, is a burthen upon their consciences; and I must confess, that I have no disposition to retain, as a political security for the Church, that which is a religious grievance to her ministers, and a scandal to her godly discipline.<lb/>
I wish to refer your lordships to the opinions of bishop Warburton upon this subject. No person has spoken more strongly in favour of a test than that prelate&#x2014;indeed, all that can be said for an exclusive test has been said by him, as all that can be said for a Sacramental Test has been urged by his illustrious contemporary Sherlock. In his celebrated work, "The Alliance between the Church and State," he gives no opinion on the Sacramental Test, except incidentally, where he says in a note, "I am fully persuaded that the use of it may be well defended;" and refers those who doubt, to the treatise of Sherlock. This was in 1736; subsequently, however, in 1765, Warburton wrote some remarks on "Neale's History of the Puritans," which he communicated to his friend Hurd, and these were his expressions&#x2014;" I think a test absolutely necessary for the security of the Established religion, where there are diversities of sects, but I think the Sacramental Test the worst that could have been chosen, for it is both evaded and profaned." Now, my lords, with regard to the Declaration contained in the bill, the Church, I think, has reason to be satisfied with it, as affording quite as valid a security as the laws, which are about to be in part repealed.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0764"/>
<col>1513</col>
Indeed, I feel perfectly persuaded that in passing the proposed bill, we shall be taking a security (to say the least of it) as ample as that we are about to relinquish. In saying this, however, I would not be understood as precluding myself from assenting to any amendments which may be hereafter proposed, with a view to render the bill more complete, without rendering it more offensive to the Dissenters.<lb/>
It would be unreasonable for us to concur so absolutely in the bill as it now stands, as to tie ourselves up from adopting any improvement which may be suggested, and of which the measure shall appear to be capable, with the view of reducing to a more perfect and effective form. But on the whole I think with the present bill the Church has abundant reason to be satisfied. The object of the exclusive test is to shut out from office those who, of necessity, and upon religious principles, are considered inimical to, and disposed to subvert or essentially and fundamentally to change, the Establishment. Yet that test has proved to be ineffectual. If the Declaration now proposed be taken by a conscientious Dissenter, it will prevent him from endeavouring&#x2014;at least from directly endeavouring&#x2014;to injure the Establishment; and that is more than the Sacramental Test, if taken, could effect; if it be taken by a person who does not conscientiously intend to observe it, that person would not be kept out of office by any test whatever. Much has been said, if not now, yet on former occasions, on the subject of bulwarks. My lords, there is a great deal in the sound of a word. When a thing has been called a bulwark for years, people are apt to take for granted, without inquiry, that it really is so; and when once they have got the idea of bulwarks into their heads, they imagine, naturally, enough, that to take away the bulwarks must weaken or destroy the edifice. I confess, my lords, I have no very high opinion of the serviceableness or importance of those bulwarks which it has been necessary to prop up year after year with the shoring of an Indemnity act, lest they should fall on the heads of those whom they were intended to protect. If bulwarks they were, they were tottering bulwarks, and it was hardly worth while to maintain them; they menaced danger, rather than promised security. But granting that they once served for the purposes
<col>1514</col>
of defence, I think they are no longer required. I think, my lords, we have within the citadel itself abundant materials of resistance and defence, not so much against the conscientious Dissenters, who stand aloof from us in minor points of difference, as against the enemies of all religion, who are endeavouring to sap and undermine the fortress of Christianity itself. I think we have within the citadel, that which renders unnecessary these hornworks and counterscarps without. If your lordships will encourage, or if need be, compel the engineers who are stationed on the ramparts to do their duty, we shall then overawe the more violent of our adversaries by the moral strength of our position, and by and by induce the more moderate to seek for refuge and protection within the walls of that fortress, which they were once confederated to beleaguer and destroy.<lb/>
But, my lords, we are accused of relinquishing a principle. It is true: and if the principle be either intrinsically vicious, or true in itself, but no longer applicable to the circumstances of our case, we consult both our credit and security by relinquishing it. But what is the principle which we abandon? Not the principle that Dissenters are only to be admitted to office upon giving the requisite security; but that they are not to be admitted at all, offer what security they may. Now this, my lords, is a principle which I am not prepared to contend for, in the case of any Christian sect whatsoever. If all can give reasonable security, let all be admitted to the exercise of their constitutional rights. From one description of persons you may receive a security, which which will not be satisfactory in the case of another; but if sufficient security be offered, exclusion becomes indefensible.<lb/>
But, my lords, I find it impossible to concur in the sentiments which have fallen from a noble earl opposite, on the subject of the laws as they now stand, affording a test of Christian principle in this country. Neither can I agree with that noble lord, in thinking that if we do away with these acts, the necessary consequence will be, to deteriorate the character we have hitherto maintained as a Christian country; at the same time that we afford encouragement and support to Atheism and Infidelity, which are already too rife among us. My lords, all I have to say in answer to the first of these observations is, that I have no desire to make the Cor-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0765"/>
<col>1515</col>
poration and Test acts serve a purpose for which they were never intended. Those acts, my lords, were never yet designed to be a test or distinction between Christians and Infidels; but only between one sect of Christians and another; and even then, rather as regards their political notions, than as it respects their religious principles, except as the latter might be affected by the former.<lb/>
The second of the noble earl's objections is, indeed, of a very serious kind. But I have no fear, lest the religious character of this country should be impaired by the measure now under consideration. This was a Christian country before these acts were passed, and will be so when they are done away. Its constitution is essentially Christian; not in virtue of the Test acts, but as having Christianity taken for granted, and interwoven in its whole texture, and made, from the very first, part and parcel of the law of the land. What, my lords, are we to be alarmed for the Christian character of this country, because we repeal a restrictive regulation, when we have the Episcopal Church, on one hand, in one portion of our dominions, and the Presbyterian Church, on the other hand, in Scotland&#x2014;while we are able to boast the Bill of Rights, the Act of Settlement, and other important securities for the maintenance of the Protestant religion?<lb/>
My lords, I am convinced there is no reason to fear that this country will suffer in its Christian character by the abolition of the Corporation and Test acts. I trust in the character of the Church itself&#x2014;in the purity of its doctrine. I trust in the ability and care of its governors&#x2014;in the faithfulness and activity of its ministers. I have confidence, my lords, in the feelings and principles of the conscientious Dissenters themselves; and in all these I find a more certain safeguard for our Christian reputation, than in the continuance of any system of exclusive laws. If I were called upon to point out the quarter from which danger is really to be apprehended to the character of this country as a Christian land, I would take leave to direct your lordships' attention, not to the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts, but to an exclusive measure of a far different kind&#x2014;I mean the exclusion of religion from the public institutions of the country&#x2014;to the countenance and support given to an institution for the instruction
<col>1516</col>
of youth, the doors of which are shut against religion under every form and modification. My lords, when I see a seminary of that description established, and about to be opened&#x2014;when I observe that its pretensions, as regards education, are of a high order&#x2014;that it has been founded under the most flattering and imposing auspices&#x2014;and when I find that, although set on foot for the education of youth, it excludes Christianity by name, I must confess that I am somewhat alarmed. When I see attempts daily made to depreciate the value of religion&#x2014;when I see her formally excluded from a province in which she has hitherto maintained an undisputed and legitimate pre-eminence&#x2014;when I see that it is attempted to obliterate the very name of Christianity from the cycle of useful knowledge, and to withdraw the education of youth from those hands to which it has long been beneficially intrusted;&#x2014;I confess I perceive some danger as likely to result to us in our character of a Christian people. And yet, my lords, after all, perhaps there is no great cause for alarm, for sure I am that no sooner shall the first-fruits of this sort of education be evinced&#x2014;no sooner shall this device of Infidelity show its front, and develop its tendencies, than the whole body of sincere Christians in this country will rise in condemnation of it.<lb/>
I feel confident that when the danger shall be clearly visible, there will be a cordial and uncompromising co-operation of all who are attached to the Catholic Church of Christ, and especially of all who belong to that branch of it which has ever formed the strong hold of true religion, and the best security of civil liberty in this country. They will all unite to prevent the results likely to ensue from a system of education carried on independently of religion. I repeat, my lords, this is the quarter, if any, from which I apprehend danger; but so far am I from thinking there is any ground for alarm in the adoption of the present measure, that I have always considered it advantageous to the Established Church, and conducive to her strength and security, to remove all exclusions and disabilities which are not absolutely requisite for her safety, and to render her as little odious as possible to those who differ from her. My lords, I attribute the state of religious quiet, which we at present enjoy, in great measure, to the operation of the Toleration acts, in
<image src="S2V0018P0I0766"/>
<col>1517</col>
the adoption of which the Church of England has not been reluctant to proceed on principles of liberality and Christian charity. I am sorry, my lords, that I have been obliged to trespass so long upon your lordships' patience; but I thought it my duty, as a bishop of the Established Church, to say what I have now said on this important occasion, when it is proposed to repeal acts long supposed to constitute important props and supports of the Establishment. Under these circumstances I deemed it necessary to state more at large, than I should otherwise have done, my reasons for offering my cordial co-operation and concurrence in the present measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01362"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution> said, that the consideration for their lordships was, whether they would repeal acts which had hitherto proved the best bulwark of the Church, for the purpose of substituting a Declaration, of the effect of which, having no experience, they could not properly judge. If the present law was proved to be oppressive and offensive, let them calmly investigate the evil, and modify it as might, appear necessary; but the necessity should be clearly and distinctly made out: and he doubted whether it had been made apparent on the present occasion. If some sufficient declaration were substituted, he had no objection to the repeal of the laws; but as for the proposed Declaration, he looked upon it as insufficient and insecure. Had a motion been brought forward for a committee to consider what ought to be substituted for the existing laws, he would not have offered the least objection; but he felt himself called upon to oppose the bill as it then stood.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CATHOLIC EMANCIPATION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01366"><member>Mr. H. Maxwell</member><membercontribution> rose to present a Petition from certain Protestant inhabitants of the county of Cavan, praying that parliament would grant no further concessions to the Roman Catholics. The petitioners said, that while they were opposed to that species of emancipation which the Roman Catholics claimed as a right, they were willing to assist them in procuring the only emancipation which would be really serviceable, to them; namely, emancipation from the trammels of a factious and disloyal priesthood, who disseminated principles that were injurious to their flocks. The petitioners expressed their conviction, that to grant political power to the Roman Catholics; would be fraught with mischief to the Protestant establishment of this country. The petitioners, seeing that the Roman Catholics had changed their tone from supplication to threats and intimidation, put it to the House whether persons who thus endeavoured to effect their object by terror and menace were entitled to favourable consideration. The petitioners, further observed, that the existence of the Catholic rent, which was enforced by a bigotted and disloyal priesthood throughout the country, was calculated greatly to alarm the Protestants of Ireland. The organization of simultaneous meetings in every part of Ireland; the measures of threat and intimidation to which the Roman Catholics had resorted; together with the seditious and insulting language which on every occasion was vented against the Protestant establishment at the Catholic Association, induced the petitioners to make this appeal to the wisdom of parliament, to curb the proceedings of that Association, whose existence they considered incompatible with the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland. They therefore, under all the circumstances, prayed that no farther concessions should be made to the Roman Catholic body. He agreed in the propriety of the prayer of the petition; But before he brought it up, he wished to put a question to the Home Secretary. During the recess, reports had gone abroad that negotiations had been entered into
<image src="S2V0018P0I0768"/>
<col>1521</col>
between the English government and the Court of Rome for the purpose of obtaining a Concordat. Those reports had given great uneasiness to the Protestants. He knew the question was of an awkward nature, and he did not wish to put it in such a way as would elicit an answer in the affirmative; because, if such an answer were given, those who were implicated in the negotiation would, under the existing law, be liable to the penalties of a <i>pr&#x0153;munire</i>. He should therefore ask, whether the reports in question were totally destitute of foundation; whether it was utterly unfounded that the English government did open such a negotiation with the Court of Rome; directly or indirectly, through themselves, or by the instrumentality of any other persons whatsoever; whether in his majesty's own immediate dominions, or on the continent; and whether it was equally false, that any other power of Europe was employed in carrying on such a negotiation, with reference to the affairs of the Roman Catholics of this country, to which England was likely to become a party.</membercontribution></p>

<title>POOR LAWS&#x2014;PAYMENT OF ABLEBODIED LABOURERS OUT OF THE POOR<lb/> RATES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01369"><member>Mr. Slaney</member><membercontribution> rose to bring forward the motion, of which he had given notice, respecting the necessity of an inquiry into the state of the Poor-laws; and, in doing so, he could not avoid remarking on the very limited attendance of members on the occasion&#x2014;a circumstance which he attributed, not so much to their want of interest for the subject in general, as to the claims of more important avocations on their time. He, however, was prepared on his side to perform the duty which he had assigned to himself. He felt it would be impossible for him to bring before the House the subject of his motion in a manner capable of exciting a due degree of attention, without trespassing on their time to an extent which otherwise he
<col>1522</col>
should be sorry to occupy. He was not discouraged by the paucity of attendants on this occasion, because he knew that there were many subjects brought before the House, which, however important, were not necessarily of a nature to command immediate attention. However, he trusted that the House would give its indulgence to one who was not much in the habit of addressing them, and who had spared no pains to obtain the very best information.<lb/>
Without further preamble, then, he should proceed to the question itself. The importance of this subject no man could doubt. Its interest was two-fold. As regarded the rich, the immense increase of the poor-rates now accumulated to an alarming degree of magnitude; and threatened, if not arrested in their progress, to overwhelm the agricultural interest in ruin. But the consequences of the Poor-laws were, in another point of view, still more alarming, and were productive of consequences more deplorable in the eyes of every man who wished well to his fellow-subjects; they had had the effect of depressing those whose only possession was their labour, of degrading the most numerous class of the community, of undermining the comforts of a body of men, who were formerly justly proud of their independence&#x2014;the peasantry of the country. To show the fallacy on which a part of the present system of Poor-laws was founded, with the further view of inducing a consideration of those laws, was the object with which he ventured to address the House. This peculiar time was auspicious for such a purpose; for parliament had now under its consideration a measure which had for its object to prevent the fluctuations that were formerly constantly taking place in the price of grain. If it were shown that, among the causes of the depression of the poor, the fluctuation in the price of grain held a leading place, then the time for doing away that fluctuation was the opportune moment for considering the state of the poor, and the abuses of the laws which affected them.<lb/>
The Poor-laws divided themselves into three distinct parts. First, the rating&#x2014;a branch of the subject so complex and so full of difficulties, as to deter him from any attempt at an investigation of its merits. The second division related to the law of settlement, on which an enlightened committee, and one from
<image src="S2V0018P0I0769"/>
<col>1523</col>
whose labours he anticipated the most valuable results, was now sitting. With that part of the question he did not mean at present to meddle. The third division embraced the law of relief, and to that division alone he meant to confine himself. With respect to that class of persons whom the early law enumerated as being the proper objects of relief; namely, the lame, the impotent, the old, and blind, he wished distinctly to be understood as having no intention to interfere with the usual relief afforded to them. He was sure that the feelings not only of the members of that House, but of every man in the country, would sanction that forbearance, and would second him in rather attempting to augment the measure of relief to such objects, by withdrawing that portion which was now absorbed by persons, who, in his estimation, had not so good a title to gratuitous support. The second class of persons to whom relief was afforded, and that whose case he now meant to consider, was the class of persons who were able to work. It must be obvious to any one, that this class comprehended two principal divisions; the first of which consisted of the artizans, manufacturers, mechanics, and their families. He begged to say that no one, in or put of that House, was more disposed to sympathise in the privations, when they did occur, under which that description of persons laboured&#x2014;no one could be more ready than he was to mitigate their sufferings; and, at all events, if he had it in contemplation to stop the means of relief on the one side, it was only in the certainty of being able, on the other, by measures of gradual amelioration, to do away with the necessity of such persons seeking relief at all. The other class to whom he alluded, consisted of the agricultural labourers, and others, who were able to work. With respect to the manufacturing poor, to whose case he had already alluded, the House would permit him to say, that no inquiry could be of more importance than one whose object was to ascertain with correctness the causes of the fluctuations to which the means of subsistence of that class were subject. What could be more dreadful than to see those industrious persons one month enjoying comfort, and the next, by some sudden revolution in commercial affairs, by some vicissitude over which they could have no control, plunged into destitution,
<col>1524</col>
without any prospect of support? He should then say, that until some sure mode was provided whereby the recurrence of these fluctuations&#x2014;which it was ascertained returned about every seven years&#x2014;should be guarded against, it would be a most unwise, most imprudent and unsafe, as well as cruel measure, to take from them that source of relief on which alone they at present rested. He trusted that the House would lend itself heartily to this great object, and sanction an inquiry into the best mode, not of avoiding those fluctuations&#x2014;for that was impossible&#x2014;but of procuring temporary employment for those who were liable to be deprived of it. For the present he would confine himself to the employment of another class of persons&#x2014;the agricultural labourers; who stood in very different circumstances from those of the manufacturing community with respect to the demand for their services, and the fluctuations to which that demand was liable. The tendencies of the people themselves to provide a security against the vicissitudes to which they were liable might suggest to the legislature, that the difficulty of providing an effectual security was not so great as they might at first imagine. This was one of those cases in which benevolence might go hand-in-hand with wisdom in determining the means of giving constant employment to the labouring class. The provident dispositions of the people began to manifest themselves; and, as a proof of the extent to which the influence of prudential considerations had reached amongst them, he would merely state, that the number of persons enrolled in those excellent institutions called Benefit Societies, as appeared by the last return, amounted to nine hundred and twenty-five thousand. And looking to the returns of the amount of deposits in Savings' banks, which had been comparatively but a short time in play, he found that the aggregate amount of deposits in the United Kingdom amounted to the enormous sum of fifteen millions sterling. It was usually calculated that 15<i>l</i>. was on the average, the deposit of each person; and that being the case, it appeared that the number of depositors was no less than one million. This fact showed the willingness of the people to avail themselves of any means within their power of providing against the vicissitudes to which their condition was liable.<lb/>
<image src="S2V0018P0I0770"/>
<col>1525</col>
He now returned to the consideration of the case of the able-bodied labourers. There were some general observations applicable to the Poor-laws, which he was sure would excite general interest. There was, no doubt, a class of the public, to whom the prospect of being exempted from part of the burthen of poor-rates, independently of any other considerations, would be a source of pleasing anticipation; and since the realization of that prospect was one of the objects, though not the chief, which he had in view, he hoped to receive the support of the House. He begged, first of all, to call the attention of the House to the amount of the poor-rates at different periods in round numbers. For the three years 1748, 1749, and 1750, the poor-rates averaged 700,000<i>l</i>. a-year. In 1783, 1784, and 1785, they were something under two millions sterling. In 1803 they increased to upwards of four millions. In 1815 they amounted to upwards of six millions sterling for each year; in 1818 to 6,800,000<i>l</i>.; and in 1821 to upwards of seven millions sterling, being the greatest amount to which they had ever attained. In 1824, the amount was near six millions. In 1825, it was 5,780,000<i>l.</i>; in 1826, 5,900,000<i>l.</i>; and in 1827, it had increased from a sum less than six millions to 6,440,000<i>l.</i>, being an increase on the general amount of poor-rates in the kingdom of nine per cent. There was, however, one thing consoling in the accounts; namely, that the abuses prevailed chiefly in the southern parts. He could mark with a line the places where wages were good, and poor-rates low; and other places where the wages were low, and the poor-rates high. He found, however, that a vast increase in the rates took place last year in the manufacturing districts, where the increase could not be attributed to the abuse of the Poor-laws. In looking at the state of those laws, he found that the vast increase of the rates last year, being an increase of nine per cent on the amount of the former year, did not arise from the abuses of the Poor-laws. He wished to ask a question, which appeared to him of some difficulty, and which might, perhaps, be answered by some member from that part of the country&#x2014;how came it to pass, that in Westmoreland, where confessedly the best system of Poor-laws was established, the poor-rates increased 19 per cent above the
<col>1526</col>
last year? In Lancashire they increased 47 per cent; in the West Riding of Yorkshire 34 per cent; in the county of Chester 24 per cenr. This arose from fluctuations in the demand for manufacturing labour, which, though deeply to be lamented, did not spring from any lasting source of depression, but was almost already passed away.<lb/>
Some person might say, that the amount of the poor-rates for the last year exhibited a diminution, as compared with their amount in 1821. But the hon. member said, that the price of corn was the great barometer of the price of labour, and that, of course, the state of the poor would be always materially influenced by the price of corn; and after referring to the amount of the latter at different periods, he contended that, in the whole there was a gradual, constant increase of the cost of maintaining the poor. And what rendered this increase the more remarkable was, that it took place notwithstanding the operation of the Select Vestry act&#x2014;an act pregnant with wisdom. He asked, must not the tendency of these rates to increase be very strong indeed, when they were found to augment, in spite of the existence of two thousand, eight hundred and sixty-eight Select Vestries throughout the kingdom, and no less than three thousand special overseers? If, then, the poor-rates advanced, even under such checks as he had described, was there not good ground furnished, in that fact, to justify him in calling on the House to look into the principle of those laws? He begged to refer the House to a return worthy of particular recommendation, on account of the small-ness of its dimensions, but which at the same time contained a great many facts, placed in a very clear manner, with reference to this subject. The work he alluded to was the "Appendix to the Poor Rates' Abstract," which was reprinted in November, 1826. He begged to read a few of the curious items which were to be found in this account. Upon a comparison made of the rates of different years, from 1806, it appeared that the cost of maintaining the poor doubled every twenty years, whilst the cost of law and litigation doubled every twelve years. According to the returns of rates made in March, 1826, it appeared that the land contributed five sevenths of the whole amount, while the manufacturing interest paid only a proportion of one twenty-fourth. He
<image src="S2V0018P0I0771"/>
<col>1527</col>
begged to be understood as not stating these facts with the view of making any invidious comparisons, or drawing any inferences from them; they were simple facts stated in the document to which he had referred, and as such he stated them.<lb/>
He had now to address himself to a part of the subject to which it was impossible to look without sincere feelings of commiseration and regret: no man could contemplate it without fear, and almost horror, considering the mass of wretchedness it displayed. The House would recollect that, in pursuance of the provisions of the 43rd of George the 3rd, returns were made of the number of paupers who were relieved by the poor-rates, consisting of persons who were totally dependent on poor-rates, with their children, and those who were only partially dependent on that fund. It appeared that the number of persons of all these descriptions amounted in 1801 to one million, and forty thousand persons; being one in nine according to the population returns of that year. In the return for 1811 he found that the children of those dependent on the poor-rates had been omitted; but having added those persons in a proportion equal to that which existed in the returns for other years, he found that the number of persons subsisting on poor-rates, either partially or wholly, amounted to one million, three hundred and forty thousand, being an increase to one in eight on the population of that year. In 1821, the number increased to one million, five hundred thousand, supposing them to augment only in the same ratio with the population; and every circumstance showed this was the case. In 1826 the number of persons receiving, or dependent on, parochial rates, had swelled to one million, seven hundred thousand; and in 1827, adding that proportion which was equivalent to the increase of the rates in that year, viz. nine per cent, the number would be one million, eight hundred and fifty thousand persons.<lb/>
He ventured to implore the House to pause a moment to consider the effect upon the prosperity of the country, as such an immense body of persons, amounting in the latter period to near one seventh of the community, each discontented with his condition, restless and anxious for change, with every temptation to crime which want could give. It was, indeed, a melancholy reflection that in this country, so justly celebrated for the wisdom of its
<col>1528</col>
institutions, and the general happiness of the people, such an extensive exception should appear among those classes whom, above all others, that House was bound to protect and assist. He ventured to refer members to the contrast afforded by Scotland in this respect, as displayed in the 3rd Report on the Poor-laws, of the 26th of May, 1818. He called the attention of the House to that country, because, if he were to select any country in which the laws were best administered, it would be that. The whole kingdom was only assessed at 43,000<i>l</i>., which was less, by 6,000<i>l.</i>, than the assessment in the county of Cumberland during that year, 1818, and one seventh the amount of the assessment of the single county of Sussex; and notwithstanding that, by avoiding the abuses which had made their way in some districts, and devoting the rate to legitimate purposes, the peasantry of Scotland, who had so little done for them, were then in a happier and more independent state, than the peasantry of England, who had so much done for them. Another cause of difference between the two countries&#x2014;and which it was impossible entirely to pass over&#x2014;was the superiority of the Scottish population over the English in point of education; but he trusted that difference was diminishing. Ignorant persons had sometimes attributed the increase in the rates to the manufacturers; but their prejudices were founded in mistake, for, by the returns made in 1825, it appeared that, in the county of Lancaster, the poor-rate was only 4<i>s</i>. a head; in the West Riding of Yorkshire, only 6<i>s</i>. a head; whereas in Suffolk it was 18<i>s</i>. a head; and in Sussex 1<i>l</i>., being five times the amount of the rate in Lancashire.<lb/>
Having made this statement (regretting at the same time that he had been obliged to go into these dry details), he would now come to the causes of the abuses which had been spoken of, and of the distresses of the agricultural labourers in this country. He thought the fluctuation of the currency had something to do with it, but that was now set at rest; but there was another, which gentlemen did not always advert to; he meant the fluctuation in the price of corn. What he was about to state would show, to any gentleman who thought we ought to return to those enormous high prices which existed in former times, that his majesty's government was doing right when they brought forward a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0772"/>
<col>1529</col>
measure calculated to prevent such fluctuations, and by that means consolidate the happiness and comfort of all classes, but more especially of the poor. He had consulted the returns of an honourable and learned friend of his, now in the East Indies (sir Edward West), in his able work on the "Wages of Labour and the Price of Corn," in order to show the effect it had on the prices of labour. From 1768 to 1793, the beginning of the Revolutionary war, the price varied from 40<i>s</i>. to 60<i>s</i>. per quarter. It was only twice below 40<i>s</i>., and never exceeded 60<i>s</i>.; on an average it was about 52<i>s</i>. So that there was then no great fluctuation in the price of the principal article in the purchase of which the wages of labour were expended. In 1795 the price amounted to 62<i>s</i>.; in 1796 to 82<i>s</i>., being higher than it had ever been before. In 1798 and 1799 it fell to 55<i>s</i>.; in 1800 it rose to 110<i>s</i>. In 1801, it was 150<i>s</i>. a quarter, being nearly treble the average of the former twenty-five years. In 1802 it decreased all at once to 72<i>s</i>. less than half the preceding-year. In 1804 it was 60<i>s</i>.; in 1805, 6, and 7, it rose to 86<i>s</i>. In 1808 it was 72<i>s</i>.; in 1809 it rose to 98<i>s</i>; in 1816 to 116<i>s</i>.; in 1811, 104<i>s</i>.; in 1812 and 1813, 126<i>s</i>.; in 1814, 96<i>s</i>.; in 1815 82<i>s</i>.; in 1816, 71<i>s</i>.; in 1817, 110<i>s</i>. It then fell, in four years, to 63<i>s</i>., by steps of 10<i>s</i>. each, and since then it had been much more steady.<lb/>
He paused a moment to ask gentlemen to reflect on the consequences of this fluctuation to the poorer classes. They had no means of shielding themselves. They had a certain amount of wages, and then suddenly, without the least warning, the bread was doubled in price. Was it possible for any man to say what his expenditure would be when the price was liable to such fluctuations? The misery caused by this fluctuation was greater than any gentleman could imagine. These were sad balances against the high rents. Some gentlemen might think it was some consolation to have got high rents; but when they found that these high prices had saddled their own estates with a burthen which threatened to take from them all rent, they would see it was far from their interest to have any system continued, under which such fluctuations must continually take place. The Committee on Labourers' Wages, in 1824, expressed themselves in their Report in, these words:&#x2014;" That
<col>1530</col>
though the system of paying part of the wages of labour out of the poor-rates began early in some districts, it had originally been introduced on the great fluctuation in the price of provisions during the last thirty years." Another cause of the depression of the labouring classes, to which he could not advert without a melancholy feeling, was the state of Ireland. At the present moment England was deluged with poor Irish labourers, taking the bread out of the mouths of the natives, by working at a lower rate of wages in their own market. It was proved in evidence before the Emigration Committee, that the poor Irish labourer, after coming to England and underselling the native, returned to his own country and paid his rent with the savings from those wages which were indirectly taken out of the poor-rates. He paid his rent by the bread taken from the English labourer. Scotland, so long justly celebrated for the independence of her industrious people, was also deluged with poor Irish, underselling in their own country the labour of the natives, and forcing them through hard necessity to have recourse to that parish support which their souls abhorred. It was not his intention now to advert farther to the state of Ireland, but the statesman and the philanthropist were alike deeply interested in endeavouring to investigate and gradually remove the causes which led to a state of things so truly deplorable.<lb/>
He would now point out some of the evils in the construction of the Poor-law act. The law of relief rested on a single statute, the 43rd of Elizabeth. Passing over that part of it which related to the old, lame, impotent, and blind, he came to the other part of the statute. It stated, "the overseers shall take order for setting to work all such persons, married or unmarried, having no means to maintain them, and using no ordinary and daily trade of life to get their living by." Daily labourers, therefore, came neither within the description or meaning of the act. The persons alluded to were the sturdy vagrants mentioned as "strong beggars, persons whole and mighty in body," in old statutes. As to the employment of daily labourers, he would refer gentlemen to the first Report of the Committee on Poor-laws in 1817, and to the Report in 1819, page 7 and 8. The Committee, in that most able and excellent report, the language of which was as clear as its views
<image src="S2V0018P0I0773"/>
<col>1531</col>
were luminous and extended, summed up against the right. Upon the subject of the Poor-laws, there were fifteen hundred solemnly decided cases, and there were four thousand justices of the peace, general expounders of the law, most of them unconnected with law professionally. It was not to be wondered at that misconstruction, doubts, and cross-readings, should have arisen in a system like this. As to the employment of able-bodied poor, he had shown the act was not intended to apply to the great body of agricultural labourers, but to those who had no ordinary and daily trade of life; but it had been carried even beyond this wide construction. The abuses in that part of the law extended through a district marked by a line drawn from the south part of Gloucestershire to Stamford, in Lincolnshire; and through every county south of that the abuses prevailed more or less. The four counties of Cornwall, Devon, Gloucester; and Somerset, were less tainted than the others; but all were tainted in a Way quite extraordinary, and they would reap their reward. The first abuse was in making up the wages out of the poor-rates. The second was in an allowance for each child. This induced a man, after he had received an allowance for one child, to apply again for an additional allowance for twins; and the third, the payment of cottage-rents. For confirmation he would venture to refer to the hon. members for Dorsetshire, Sussex, and Hertfordshire. The Report of 1817 stated this&#x2014;"A practice has prevailed in many counties of England, to defray the wages of labour out of the poor-rates, according to a uniform scale of relief." This reminded him of the hon. member for Wiltshire. In Wiltshire they had a uniform bread-scale, by which they gave to every man according to his family, or the price of bread. He thought that a more enormous injustice was never done to poor as well as rich, than the introduction of such a scheme. It tended to defeat the inequality between the industrious and idle man, and was detrimental alike to the interests of all classes. The next Report was that on Labourers' Wages in 1824. At the head of that committee sat the noble lord, who had done the country inestimable service in many ways. After having looked into the subject with all care, they reprobated the abuses alluded to, particularly the employment of roundsmen. Perhaps
<col>1532</col>
some gentlemen might not know the meaning of the term roundsmen. When any man came to the parish for employment, and the parish did not find him employment, as they ought to do under the wide construction of the act, they sent the man round to different farmers, saying, "You must employ him so much, and you so much, paying small wages, and the parish will make up the rest." The evil of this practice augmented itself, and the steady and hard-working labourer was converted into an inefficient pensioner. Upon this subject he would refer gentlemen to the Report of the Emigration Committee in 1826 and 1827. The gentleman who presided over that committee deserved every praise. He would refer to the evidence of the hon. member for the county of Sussex, and other members, to show the degraded state of the peasantry in some districts, owing to these abuses. He would venture to state the returns for which he had moved last year, which had not been laid before the House, but of which he had obtained a partial account from the Home Office. One motion was for the number of persons relieved in all parishes of Suffolk, Essex, Hertford, and two or three others; and also for the number of able-bodied men relieved. In Suffolk, taking twenty parishes, the total relieved was 2,490. Of these, 607 were able-bodied men, or about one fourth. In Essex, the whole number amounted to 3,030; able-bodied men 979, or near one third. In Hertford, the total number was 2,437, the able-bodied men 877. He could mention abuses after abuses of this kind. In Winburn it was usual to allow a loaf for every person, and so much for every child. The same thing prevailed in almost all the southern counties. This allowance, of so much for each child, this bounty on marriage took away all dread of entering into the married State, and multiplied labourers beyond the demand of the country. He had received a letter from a respectable clergyman in Northamptonshire, stating one of the consequences from these abuses, which fell under his own knowledge, and which was unfortunately no rare instance. Six pauper orphans had been brought up by the parish, with the prospect of getting them out into regular employment. When the eldest arrived at eighteen, the worst thing happened to him that could happen to a pauper youth; he fell in love with a
<image src="S2V0018P0I0774"/>
<col>1533</col>
woman in a neighbouring parish; the lad was not worth a penny, but his love was strong, and marry he would; so he brushed the coat which the parish had given him, put the parish hat gaily on one side, and throwing down disdainfully the parish spade, marched off to seek the lady of his choice, singing at the top of his voice that song which echoes in the summer time through all the green lanes and all the dusty roads in the southern counties where these abuses prevail, and which begins with that celebrated verse,
<quote>"Hang sorrow, cast away care,</quote>
<quote>The parish is bound to maintain us."</quote>
The parish officers, however, were of a different mind. As the father of the young man was dead, the parish officer considered that he stood <i>in loco parentis</i>, and that, as guardian of the young man, he was entitled to forbid the banns. Some doubt arising, however, a case was laid before a learned civilian, who gave it as his opinion, that the parish officer had no right to forbid the banns. The rev. clergyman added, at the end of his letter, that all the children were boys, and they would, most probably, follow the example thus set them, and marry at the age of eighteen, knowing that the parish would have to bear the expenses of the lying-in, as well as to make provision for the children. According to the statement of Mr. Hodges, the chairman of the West Kent sessions, the effect of this system upon the condition and number of labourers was apparent. In a parish called Smarsden there were two hundred and ninety-seven labourers, of whom sixty were supernumerary; in that of Grenville there were one hundred, twenty-five of whom were dependent on the poor-rates. In another parish, out of one hundred and sixty labourers, forty-five were supernumeraries. In another there were ninety-six, fifteen of whom were similarly circumstanced; and, notwithstanding this, there were sixty new cottages built in the last-mentioned parish within twenty years; and he did not see what was to prevent such building of cottages, when it was known that the parish would take them and pay rent for them. It appeared that, in 1823, in the division of Cray, in Lower Kent, there were sixteen parishes, containing a population of twenty-one thousand persons, eight thousand two hundred of whom were paupers. With regard to the whole country, one in every seven inhabitants was the melancholy proportion
<col>1534</col>
of persons receiving aid; but here the case was still worse, for there was one pauper almost in every two; besides six hundred and eighty-two who had no employment; and it was said by the gentleman whom he had quoted, that the same, description was applicable to all Kent, and to a district in Suffolk. He added that, nevertheless, many cottages were built on the speculation of the parish rates for payment of the rent. The hon. member for Sussex had confirmed a portion of this statement. He would venture to say that, through the last abuse to which he had referred&#x2014;the paying the cottage rents&#x2014;a great proportion of pauperism was created. The first difficulty presenting itself to the mind of a young man who contemplated marriage was, how to get a house; and if the parish gave him one, the only obstacle to his entering into this engagement, when he had no means of supporting a family, was removed. This was in the very teeth of the law, and in direct opposition to the interests both of the employer and the labourer. He had enumerated the sixteen counties in which the three great abuses principally prevailed, but they were not confined to those counties. Some of them (especially the baneful custom of paying rents), had made their way into Worcestershire, Nottinghamshire, and other counties beyond the line described, and were fast spreading into the northern parts of this island, which had been heretofore untainted, and in which, owing to their being untainted, the state of the peasantry was one of happiness, independence, and comfort, as contrasted with the other districts. He held in his hand an abstract which showed the effects of the abuses of the Poor-laws in the southern counties. The return of wages paid in the year 1824 to unmarried men, in the sixteen counties which he had mentioned, stated the lowest daily wages as no more than six-pence. He would now take twenty of the northern and Welch counties&#x2014;not manufacturing counties, including, however, Lancashire&#x2014;and in these the lowest wages were one shilling per day. Thus, where the abuses existed, the wages were lower; while in those counties in which a just discrimination was observed, and the laws were more properly administered, labourers received a better remuneration. It was admitted, that these abuses prevailed in particular counties. He should now refer to some
<image src="S2V0018P0I0775"/>
<col>1535</col>
of the consequences. It appeared that in the counties of Gloucester, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, the abuses prevailed least; but in each they were prevalent more or less. In the seventeen counties in which they chiefly prevailed, it appeared by the returns to parliament, that the poor-rates amounted to fifteen shillings a head on the whole population; while in the twenty contiguous counties, where it appeared from evidence that a better system was adopted, they were only six shillings a head; being only a proportion of two-fifths; and, at the same time, the poor were better off where the rates were low, and the labouring classes were not degraded by the necessity of resorting to them for a support, but were encouraged in their virtuous efforts for independence.<lb/>
He now came to a point which would be considered of importance. In the seventeen counties where the abuses prevailed, the rate amounted to four shillings in the pound on the rack rent. The returns ought, in all cases, to be made upon the rack rent throughout the kingdom. This would enable men to understand the subject in its true light, without being perplexed with accounts so complicated, that their import could not be divined even by a magician. Looking into the returns relative to the Property-tax, he found, that in the seventeen counties to which he had alluded, the rate amounted to four shillings on the rack rent; while, in the twenty counties where the labourers were better paid, they were no more than two and sixpence. He would, therefore, offer to those who lived in the southern counties a bonus of nearly what they paid to the Property-tax to enter upon a better system, to give independence and encouragement to a class which was pulled down and depressed by the mal-administration of these laws. If, therefore, they could benefit the rich, and at the same time ameliorate the condition of the poor, ought they not to enter upon the task&#x2014;he would not say with haste or impetuosity, but with earnestness and zeal? He had shown that an enormous direct advantage would flow from the adoption of a better system; but it would also be productive of very great indirect benefit. If the expenses occasioned by crime and disease, including the cost of maintaining gaols, hospitals, &amp;c., were estimated, they would be
<col>1536</col>
found to amount to at least one-half of the poor-rates; for a great proportion of the prosecutions arose from the depressed state of the poor under the present system. It was, indeed, unnecessary to prove that misery, want, and hunger were the fertile sources of despair, disease, and crime; but he held in his hand returns which put the matter out of doubt, and shewed that the increase of criminals was in due proportion to the augmentation of paupers. In 1806, the number of criminals committed was four thousand three hundred; in 1816, nine thousand; in 1826, sixteen thousand; and according to the right hon. Secretary for the Home Department, in 1827, nearly eighteen thousand; notwithstanding food was cheaper than formerly. If, then, the poor-rates amounted to six millions, the whole cost attending the system would be nine millions. If the poor-rates increased, as they did five per cent every year, by the unnatural depression of the poor, and by a state of things which might be removed, the support of the poor would cost the country in each year 450,000<i>l</i>. more than it had done in the preceding year. In the last year the increased cost of poverty on the country was 810,000<i>l</i>., every tittle of which might have been saved with advantage, not only to the rich, but also to the poor. He was happy to know that most gentlemen admitted the existence of the evils. Indeed, the fact could not be disputed. But it was asked, how were they to be remedied? He looked to the principle. When the poor were not paid, or not sufficiently paid, they naturally became vicious, dissolute, and careless. The great point was to enable them to do for themselves, and to obtain good wages. Now, all the returns showed that where wages were good, the poor rates were low, and where the average of wages was small, the rates were proportionably high. The poor ought to have good wages, and not to be kept down by an unnatural cause, like the present system of the Poor-laws. If, then, it was agreed that the poor must have good wages, he came to the principle by which they should be regulated. The principle was short, but important. The wages of the poor must be regulated in the same manner as every thing else, by the proportion of the demand to the supply. He would not trouble the House with references to the different writers who had maintained this
<image src="S2V0018P0I0776"/>
<col>1537</col>
proposition, but it would not be supposed that the committees of that House, who had sat for the investigation of the subject, were likely to have indulged in idle theories, or foolish speculations, and he could not put the matter in a clearer point of view than in their own words. The first report agreed to by a committee of forty of the most intelligent gentlemen of that House, laid it down that "what number could be employed in labour must depend alone upon the funds which were to maintain them, and as the demand for labour must depend upon the wealth of the country, so the rate of wages must be according to the proportion of the demand to the supply. And in proportion to the degree of nicety with which the demand and supply was adjusted, were the happiness and independence of the labouring people." Then came the question, how was this proportion to be maintained? He answered, simply, by letting it alone&#x2014;by not attempting to legislate better than Providence. The general law which would check the growth of the supply beyond the demand, was prevented by the operation of the present laws, or rather by the abuse of the law, for he did not quarrel with the 43rd of Elizabeth. He thought it an excellent legislative measure, but it had been perverted to ends as contrary to wisdom and justice as he was sure they were at variance with the spirit of the framer. In the report of June 1819, another committee said, "that the demand and the supply had such a tendency in the natural course of things to balance each other, that any excess in either arising from temporary causes, if met by temporary expedients, would, if not defeated by unnatural circumstances, in no longtime correct itself." The report on labourers' wages in 1824, said, "that by the abuses of the Poor-laws a surplus population was encouraged. Those who had but a small pittance knew that it would be augmented in proportion to the number of their children; and hence the supply of labour was by no means regulated by the demand. But what was by far the worst consequence of the system was the degradation which it entailed upon the labouring classes." The third Emigration Report, which was drawn up with peculiar ability, said that "the first and main principle was, that labour, which was the commodity of the poor man, took its value from the circum-
<col>1538</col>
stances incidental to all other commodities, and the supply must be regulated by the demand."<lb/>
Thus, all the committees had come to the same conclusion. It was seen, then, that the rate of wages must be regulated by the demand and the supply. Now, with respect to the demand, the sum of it must depend upon the capital of the country; and if it depended upon the capital of the country, it depended upon that which could not be increased by law. If it was impossible to increase capital by acts of parliament, what was to be said of the laws which supposed it to be possible? The effect of the Poor-laws was, when they gave employment to one labourer to throw another out of employment, and they had this additional disadvantage, that while the industrious labourer added to the capital of the country, the pauper diminished it. These laws, by holding out a bonus, kept the supply above the demand and depressed the poor. It was necessary, therefore, for the legislature to retrace its steps, and to return to a natural state of things. They should not increase the supply by a bonus. He knew it would be both absurd and unwise to attempt to limit the amount of population, but it was a different thing to remove the bonus for its increase. And this was the object of the measure he had in view. An outcry had been raised in reference to the proposition which he introduced last year, as if he wished to push the measure through the House. He had no intention of passing that bill: his only object was to use it as a means of creating a discussion on the subject. He knew that its provisions were, in many points, impracticable. But he still adhered to the principle upon which the former measure was founded. His object was two-fold; first, to prevent the recurrence of the evil; and secondly, to give assistance to the sufferers in the transition from one state of things to another. This was to be effected by returning gradually to the system of the forty-third of Elizabeth. The Reports of all the committees to which he had referred, recommended the prevention of the spread of the evil, and a gradual introduction of a new system. Able-bodied labourers were generally divided into two classes, the first class consisted of new applicants, and the second of persons who were dependent. He should propose that the overseers be empowered.
<image src="S2V0018P0I0777"/>
<col>1539</col>
to employ unmarried labourers, but under particular circumstances only. But then it would be said, that it would be a very hard case if young men, who were able and willing to work, could not get employment. What he should propose was, that such young men should have a right to get employment, on paying a certain small sum, to be previously deposited in a savings' bank. Suppose the applicant paid in a sum of four shillings, then he was to be entitled to an extra week's work from the parish officers. In the event of his becoming independent of the parish, he might take up the sum so deposited, or devise it by will. This was a plain and simple plan, nor was it like Smollett's machine to cut cabbages for the purpose of saving a dish of sprouts. With the view of facilitating the mode of giving employment, he should suggest that a power to contract for work should be given to the parish officers. Suppose, for instance, that a gentleman wanted work done, for which he was willing to pay 100<i>l</i>., the parish officers might say, sir, we are willing to contract with you to do it for 50<i>l</i>., on condition of your employing the parish labourers. By this plan, though the labourers would be paid out of the poor-rates, the same evil would not arise as under the present system, for there would be no competition to the prejudice of other individuals; as the work would not be of the ordinary description; but such only as without such a temptation would not have been undertaken. He should next propose, in the case of married labourers, that where the number of children exceeded four or five, the present individuals should receive a little assistance proportioned to such excess, but that no fresh applicants should be entitled to it. And finally, that, as regarded all classes of able-bodied labourers, no parish assistance should be given them, except in the form of employment. From the difficulty of effectually rating the occupiers of small tenements, that species of property (as is stated in the Special Vestry act) enjoys a practical exemption from those rates to which all other property is liable, and persons are induced thereby to lay out their money in such tenements speculating on the high rates such exemption may ensure them: this inequality ought to be removed, by rendering the owners of such tenements liable for rates instead of the poor occupiers. For his own part, he
<col>1540</col>
had not the vanity to imagine that he could devise a remedy for so great an evil as the present system had given rise to; all he wished was, that the subject should be referred to a committee of gentlemen who were conversant with it, and capable of framing a measure accordingly. He should therefore move for leave to bring in a bill "to declare and amend the law relative to the employment of able-bodied labourers, and the better rating of tenements under a certain value."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01372"><member>Mr. Cripps</member><membercontribution> said, that although he admitted the hon. mover had displayed considerable information in his address to the House, and was entitled to their thanks for the pains he had taken in investigating this difficult, subject, he entertained considerable apprehensions that no practical benefit would result from the bill proposed. If no regard were to be had, in the estimate of the claim of the poor, to the number of the individuals in their respective families, and the quantity of labour to be shared amongst those who were in want of employment, of what avail was any bill for that purpose? The remedy, in his mind, consisted in judicious arrangements by gentlemen in the country themselves, and could only be effected by applying their attention to the appropriation of the funds for the relief of the poor in their several parishes. It was in vain to attempt to draw the line as to the artificial distinction of able-bodied and other paupers. If the means of subsistence were withheld from the former during periods of scarcity, they would within a short time become of the latter class, and be strictly entitled to parochial relief. Even charitable donations or foundations were of no avail in stopping
<image src="S2V0018P0I0778"/>
<col>1541</col>
the growth of pauperism in this country, for he would venture to affirm, that in those parishes where the charities were the largest, the poor-rates were, in the same proportion, high. Nor was it surprising: for as soon as the indigent in other parishes heard that the poor in this place received allowances on the score of rent or for firing, out of such and such a charitable fund, they never rested until they obtained a settlement in a parish which enjoyed so many advantages over their own. It was the same with manufactories, although, in the first instance, they lowered the poor-rates, the moment a check in business took place those rates rose alarmingly. For himself, he confessed, that although he wished the hon. member success in his undertaking, he feared little would be effected by this bill, or by that in the contemplation of an other hon. member for altering the settlement; except that probably the latter might tend to discourage litigation, and so effect a trifling reduction in the poor-rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01373"><member>Mr. Burrell</member><membercontribution> doubted whether the proposed measure would prove of utility. There was one proposal, however, of the hon. member, which, he thought he would find it impossible to carry into effect. He alluded to that by which unmarried men were to lay up, or to have laid up for them, a fund saved from their labours when employed, from which they were to be supplied when unemployed. Now, it would be impossible for the labourer to lay up money, if, as he feared was the case, he never at any time earned more than enough to keep himself. Indeed, he saw no prospect of relief from the evil which oppressed them, except in emigration. When that was begun, the agricultural parishes could take care that the vacancies that were made should not again be filled up. If so extreme a measure became necessary, he should not hesitate, when emigration was begun, to pull down the cottages, as fast as they became empty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01374"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, he was disposed to agree most cordially with the hon. member for Hertford, that there was not much to be expected from the bill, in the way of general relief, although he concurred in the principles upon which it proceeded. As long as there was no restoration of the proportions between the two classes of society, and as long as they told the poor man that he had a right by
<col>1542</col>
law to be supported, so long must they continue to suffer under all the evils produced by a superabundant population. If the Poor-laws continued in full operation with this increasing population, they would ultimately absorb the whole rental of the country. He was surprised, however, to find that the country gentlemen, notwithstanding all that had been said, were not at all disposed to view the matter in that light. "What," said they, "deprive us of our population? Why, the population forms the wealth of the country." He told them, that if they thought proper to make a present of their estates to the poor, it was very well; but unless they discouraged the disposition to improvident marriages, the Poor-laws must in time absorb all the income of the higher classes. It was said, that they ought to cultivate the waste lands. But did they not recollect, that these waste lands, if they proved of good quality, would, of course, throw some of the poorer lands out of cultivation, and that the general effect must be to lower the rents of the land owners? It was not a little extraordinary that there existed such a degree of supineness upon a subject which involved the very existence of the higher classes. All remedies, however, must prove futile, until they assimilated the laws of England and Ireland, upon the subject of providing for the poor. He did not mean to say, that they ought to extend the English Poor-law system to Ireland; but that they ought to pass a law which would have the effect of checking the tendency to increase the population of both these countries, and restore the numerical proportions which ought to exist between the different classes of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01375"><member>Mr. Ridley Colborne</member><membercontribution> condemned the system of paying labourers out of the poor-rates. The hon. mover professed by the bill to give employment to none of the able-bodied men who did not comply with certain conditions; but he ought to recollect, that if an able-bodied man were refused relief, in forty eight hours he became weak and helpless. He believed that all regulations of this kind must be left to the discretion of those who were called upon to administer their provisions. He apprehended, too, that the hon. gentleman's bill could not be carried into effect without some alteration of the law of Settlement. If they took away from
<image src="S2V0018P0I0779"/>
<col>1543</col>
the pauper the power to dispose of his labour in the best market&#x2014;and at the same time, by the law of Settlement, fixed him to the soil, he conceived they were bound to find him employment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01376"><member>Mr. Monck</member><membercontribution> thought the House ought to recollect that it was not the free institutions, but the happy and prosperous condition of its people, which gave a character to a nation. A good deal had been said about the redundancy of population being one of the effects of the Poor-laws; but the condition of Ireland, labouring under the same redundancy without any Poor-laws, shewed that the opinion was founded in fallacy. Ireland, without any Poor-laws, presented the spectacle of the most numerous, increasing, and deplorably wretched population on the face of the earth. After some observations in condemnation of the system of paying labourers out of the Poor-rates, which, he said, took its rise in his county, from a recommendation of the magistrates to avoid any rise in wages, lest they might find a difficulty in lowering them again, the hon. member observed, that the pay tables then invented had given rise to all the miseries which the paupers had since suffered. The moment the harvest was over, the farmer reduced the wages to eight shillings, then to seven, and so on until every labourer in the parish became a pauper. A man, too, who had a wife and two children, found himself in no worse condition than a single man. He had bread and water, the liberal allowance of the parish, as a single man; and he had bread and water as a married man; so that the system gave no discouragement to the increase of the number of paupers. If they refused relief to all able-bodied men, they would give an increase to mendicity; for if a man could not get work, there was no law which could compel him to abstain from asking relief; and they would thus cure one evil by increasing another. The only remedy for all this was, in his opinion, the adoption of a minimum of wages: and that might, perhaps, produce a minimum of wretchedness. He would give every man the price of a bushel of wheat, and that would afford him all the comforts of life. If he married then, knowing the amount of his wages, he married at his own peril. It was a law of nature, that the single man should be better off than the married man; but we reversed that law, and made the single
<col>1544</col>
man the worst off. It was impossible to counteract a law of nature with impunity, and accordingly, our present system punished us in the manner complained of.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01377"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he agreed in all that had been offered with respect to the vast importance of this subject. He agreed also, that it was highly desirable that government should form a decided opinion upon it; but, unfortunately, it was one of those subjects which the more it was studied, the more difficult it was to come to a positive conclusion. It was in vain to call upon government to pronounce a decided opinion; for it was impossible for any man who had a proper diffidence of his own judgment to come to one. He could not think that the want of employment for the people of this country arose from any cessation of productiveness; for within the three last years there had been a greater quantity both of agricultural and manufacturing employment, than in any other three preceding years in the history of this country. How, then, were the increased rates to be accounted for? Did it arise from the operation of the Poor-laws? If so, how came it that in Ireland, where no Poor-laws existed, they were much worse off? In Scotland there was an intermediate system between that of England and Ireland; but there also there was distress, though not great. His impression was, that no effectual remedy could be applied in the present artificial state of the country. Much of the distress arose from the improvement of machinery, and what remedy, he would ask, could be applied against the progress of human enterprise and ingenuity? He was prepared to give his assent to the bill, but he thought it was necessary to consider its bearing upon other regulations connected with the same subject. He thought the law of settlement was intimately connected with the provisions of the bill. Many of the evils of the Poor-laws proceeded from the law of settlement; but that only shewed the difficulty of laying down any laws which might be applicable to all conditions of society. If the provisions of the bill were carried into effect, he was convinced it would be necessary to make considerable alterations in that law. The House could not pass the two measures simultaneously, without considering the bearing of one upon the other. The hon. mover had said a great deal on the abstract principle; but looking
<image src="S2V0018P0I0780"/>
<col>1545</col>
at the artificial state of society, and to the state of the laws relative to the poor, and to labour, he thought the hon. gentleman would be more likely to advance his purpose by giving it the full benefit of deliberate consideration. Considering the mode in which the Poor-laws were administered, it was difficult, if not impossible, to foresee how any new principle would work, merely from viewing it in the abstract. Until this measure, therefore, had been more discussed and examined than it now could be, he could not venture to support it merely on the able declaration of the hon. gentleman. In common with the rest of the House, he returned his acknowledgements to the hon. gentleman for the ability with which he had brought the question forward; but seeing how it was connected with other parts of the Poor-laws, he could not give it his support; though the hon. gentleman had his best wishes for the success of his object, which he thought would be most certainly attained by the fullest deliberation upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01378"><member>Colonel Davies</member><membercontribution> regretted to hear the right hon. gentleman express his opinion, that there was no remedy for evils which were likely to absorb the prosperity of the country, and overturn its institutions. Certainly, if government would not take up the subject, nothing effectual could be accomplished; for as to any gentleman attempting to bring in any measure without the assistance of government, such was the magnitude of the question, that it was beyond the grasp of any individual. He thought the right hon. gentleman had taken a wrong view of it, when he stated it to be his opinion, that the two measures could not pass together. There was no difference in their principle. Nothing, indeed, could more usefully co-operate with the plan of the hon. mover for the amelioration of the condition of the poor, than an alteration of the law of Settlement. The right hon. gentleman asked, whether it was not a great hardship to refuse a pauper relief, and at the same time prevent him from carrying his labour to the best market? This was altogether a mistake. It was at present that the labourer was prevented from obtaining employment; because, under the existing law, the farmer was afraid, by employing him, of giving him a settlement. The man was thus driven back to his own parish; but if the farmer knew that by giving him labour, he did
<col>1546</col>
not give him a settlement, he would employ him, because he could not apprehend that the labourer would become a permanent burthen to the parish. The proposed bill would, therefore, give greater facilities to the poor man in carrying his labour to the best market. His hon. friend had been asked, how he could propose to refuse relief to an able-bodied man, unless, by being reduced to absolute starvation, he had fallen into a state of weakness and decrepitude? But did not those hon. gentlemen see, that if an able-bodied man, in order to live by asking alms, could only obtain them by reducing himself almost to starvation, the shocking spectacle he would exhibit would induce others to keep out of his situation, and would thus check the recklessness of the poor with regard to future consequences? He agreed with his hon. friend in all his propositions he had stated; and he trusted, that, when he brought in the bill, he would not set out by saying in despair, that nothing could be clone; because, while that feeling prevailed, nothing would be done. There was no doubt that effectual remedies might be applied to these evils. Mr. Malthus was of opinion, that if the country gentlemen, and particularly if ministers, would look the subject fairly in the face, they might be overcome. Such, also, was his own opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01379"><member>Mr. Slaney</member><membercontribution> said, it was not his intention to press the bill through the House this session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01380"><member>Mr. Whitmore</member><membercontribution> said, he admitted that great evils existed, in different parts of the country, from a redundant population; but he believed there was by no means throughout Great Britain, such a redundancy as the right hon. gentleman had stated. There always would be a certain pressure on the means of subsistence, which it would be impossible to prevent by any system of laws that could be framed. This pressure was very general in this country, but there was not that great degree of distress among the labouring classes which some gentlemen assumed. No one lamented the distress that actually did exist more than himself. It had arisen, in a great measure, from the causes stated by the hon. member for Reading. The system commenced in the county of Norfolk; and when it originated, Mr. Burke had pointed out the evils that would ensue from it. To that cause he chiefly attributed the distress of the labouring
<image src="S2V0018P0I0781"/>
<col>1547</col>
classes. It was his knowledge of the existence of that distress in particular places, and his conviction of the difficulty of finding any other remedy, that induced him to treat with favour the proposition to be submitted that evening on the subject of Emigration. No doubt, in particular places, great advantages would accrue from removing individuals who were now suffering the misery of extreme poverty. He understood that emigration, to a considerable extent, was taking place from five parishes in Sussex, and sanguine expectations were entertained that benefit would accrue from it. At any rate, great advantage would accrue from the discussion of the subject; because, as the evil had originated in the administration of the law, and more from the misapplication of the principle of the law than from the law itself, the remedy, after all, must be found in that system, which the people would learn by the discussion they had the power to introduce themselves. He had no doubt that they would be able to devise measures to remove, or at least to alleviate the existing evils, and prevent their growth in future. One advantage would assuredly arise from it. It would lessen the practice of paying the rent of cottages out of the poor-rates, by depriving it of the sanction of the magistrates. A reduction would follow in the rent of cottages, which were now raised to a great height in some places, because it was paid by the parish, and not by the occupants. In addition to the diminution of rent, he hoped to see the system prevail of giving sufficient gardens to the cottages. This plan had been introduced, with considerable benefit to the pauper and to the parish also, in the shape of a diminution of the rates. It had beside raised the poor in their own estimation, and, by increasing their comforts, ameliorated their condition. He returned his sincere thanks to the hon. mover for the great pains he had bestowed upon the subject, and the light he had thrown upon it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EMIGRATION.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01382"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> rose, to move for leave to bring in a Bill "to enable Parishes in England, under given regulations, and for a limited period, to mortgage their Poor-rates, for the purpose of assisting Voluntary Emigration." His hon. friend, who had just addressed the House, had stated, that a measure of
<col>1548</col>
this nature, under certain modifications, would be attended with consequences advantageous to those parishes where a redundant population was concentrated, and for whose labour there was no demand. But, although he was prepared to allow that, as far as the manufacturing districts were concerned, a beneficial change had taken place since the early part of last year, he was not prepared to concede, that the state of Ireland was such as to induce him to think that a superabundant population did not exist, in every proper sense of the word. Unless terms was very specifically defined, it was impossible that two parties arguing could arrive at the same conclusion, from their having different ideas attached to the same words. Some members would contend broadly, that there was not too much population. The hon. baronet (sir J. Wrottesley) said, he had always considered the population the real wealth of the country. By diminishing the population, therefore, the hon. baronet supposed we should diminish the wealth of the country. But any thing more contrary to reason he could not imagine. Though population was the source of all wealth, yet, to suppose that, by carrying it to an extreme, evil would not ensue, was what he had expected nobody would deny. It was true that the blood constituted the strength of the human body; but in excess it produced weakness and death. There was one simple test that might be applied to the state of the population. The House had heard that evening of persons for whom no employment whatever could be procured. Did it not follow that those persons were in a situation in which they could not add to the wealth of the country? This proposition was one that could not be examined for a moment without being assented to. Was it, then, not worth inquiring whether, instead of maintaining those persons at home, they might not be removed to another country, where they would be able, not only to repay the expense of their removal, but to change their condition to one of comparative comfort? He gladly availed himself, therefore, of the observation that had fallen from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, who had said that he would not object to any efficient plan to rescue the unemployed poor from their distress, and raise them to a happy and contented station. Could there be a question that, by making
<image src="S2V0018P0I0782"/>
<col>1549</col>
an outlet for the redundant population, a permanent relief might be afforded to Ireland? The evils of that country had arisen from the excessive subdivision of land; but no change in that respect could be effected, until the impediment of a large population was removed. He advocated these principles, not under the patronage, but in the teeth of his majesty's government. He came there only as Chairman of the committee; and he felt it his duty to bring forward this measure, coupled as it was with the conviction of his own mind, that it was founded on a sound principle, and that the House must, sooner or later, hold it entitled to practical consideration. He could see no advantage likely to result from confining their views to the state of England, without reference to the state of Ireland; because he was the last man who could consider it a part of our policy to resist the free migration of Irishmen to this country. The Union must set aside all idea of hermetically sealing our ports against the Irish. Look, then, at the condition of Ireland, as it was detailed in the evidence before the Emigration Committee. He had also in his possession letters which, if published, would astonish the House. The Irish landlords dared not carry the law into execution for dispeopling their estates by the Subletting act. They were restrained by a combined feeling of humanity and apprehension. They were indisposed to throw out of their present means of existence a parcel of wretches, houseless and naked, to take their chance in the market of the world. Emigration was not a scheme arising from the problems of political economy. The Greeks and Romans had recourse to it, and, at some period or other, every great nation under the sun. Nothing could be more preposterous than to suppose it a new project applicable to modern Europe and this country. The chief objection was, that any plan of emigration would be expensive, and that the finances of the country were not in a condition to bear the advances necessary for that purpose. He denied it would cost anything; for he considered it would cost nothing, if it involved the repayment of the advance. He begged the attention of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to one simple point on which the whole question turned. He undertook to prove, that the maintenance of the labourers and their families, whose labour was not in demand in this country,
<col>1550</col>
was a direct tax on the community at large. He estimated that the men, women, and children, taken one with another, were not to be fed, clothed, and lodged, under 3<i>l</i>. per head per annum. One hundred thousand of these persons could be removed, it had been calculated, at an expense of 60,000<i>l.</i> a-year, laying aside any prospect of re-payment. At present these one hundred thousand persons, at 3<i>l.</i> per head, cost the country 300,000<i>l.</i> a-year. If for 60,000<i>l.</i> they could be removed to the colonies, there would clearly be a saving of 240,000<i>l.</i> annually out of the general revenue of the country. As it was his intention to bring forward a substantive motion for a pecuniary grant to be applied as a loan, to carry into effect the plans recommended by the Emigration Committee, with such variations as his now more mature judgment and the assistance of his friends had led him to make, he would not forestal what he then meant to say, by dwelling longer on that part of the subject. He would only call again the attention of his right hon. friend to this point: if there existed one hundred thousand persons, for whose labour there was no demand, and whose subsistence cost the country 300,000<i>l.</i> a-year, and they could be removed at an expense amounting only to 60,000<i>l.</i>, would not their removal be attended with benefit to the country?&#x2014;But it was objected, that the gap would be filled up again immediately. This he denied. As to Ireland, there were means of preventing this result, which had been suggested by the wisest and most gifted man that island had ever produced: he meant the destruction of the cottages when the parties were removed from them.&#x2014;He supported this measure, not only with reference to the interests of property, but of the poor themselves, who were reduced to a state in which no population ought to be, especially that of the freest and most powerful country in the world. On all occasions he was met with the objection, that the expense of emigration would be excessive, and that the able-bodied men would be the persons first to emigrate. He knew there was a disposition, in some quarters, to depreciate political economists, yet he owned he was not disposed to slight the opinions of men of great natural as well as of acquired talent&#x2014;men of much reflection, and who had directed their attention to an intricate and subtle subject. He would not be bound by their verdict;
<image src="S2V0018P0I0783"/>
<col>1551</col>
but their evidence was all to the effect, that, in a pecuniary point of view, the expense would be judiciously laid out. Looking at the question as a pecuniary one, they were of opinion, that it would be far more profitable to send out emigrants to cultivate fertile lands in the colonies, than to employ them in bringing into cultivation poor soils in England. That the latter plan was utterly unprofitable, was proved by the circumstance, that no capitalists were found to engage in such an enterprise. That emigration was attended with beneficial results was proved by experiment. Many who had emigrated paupers from this country had thriven, and left a positive inheritance to their children. The bringing into cultivation the bogs of Ireland was recommended by some persons&#x2014;not by those, however, who were much interested in the amelioration of the condition of the poorer classes. Landholders who were unwilling to expend their own money in an undertaking of this kind, were willing enough to have the public money expended on its promotion. The right hon. gentleman proceeded to state the circumstances under which the bill originated. An application had been made by Dr. Spry, the rector of Mary-le-bonne, when he was connected with the Colonial-office, to know if it were permissible to send out twenty female paupers. It was proposed, on the part of the parish, if it were legal, to mortgage the poor-rate, in order to send them to New South Wales. When the application was made, it was suggested, that if this could be done, it would be very serviceable to many other parishes. The matter was submitted for the opinion of the law-officers of the Crown; it was subsequently ascertained that the mortgage could not be effected. These circumstances led to the bringing forward of the bill. The application from Mary-le-bonne was made on benevolent principles, as well as prudential ones; as, by mortgaging the poor-rates for a short time, they would be enabled to get rid of the maintenance of the paupers, which was perpetually entailed on them. He wished to observe, that it was not intended by this bill that it should be compulsory on parishes; on the contrary, he wished it merely to be a permissive measure. It was intended that it should be surrounded by checks and guards for that purpose. For instance, it would be requisite that four fifths of the
<col>1552</col>
rate-payers, and four fifths of the proprietors should be consentients to the bill. It was also intended, that not more than one tenth of the effective labourers of the parish should leave it in any one year. Moreover, he would not propose that the measure should be a perpetual one. Let the experiment be tried for a few years; and if it were not found to answer, it might be repealed. There were some parishes in which such a measure might be beneficially introduced, though it might be unsuited to others. The right hon. gentleman concluded by enforcing the expediency of encouraging emigration for the benefit of Ireland; where the population was rapidly increasing, and where there was a corresponding increase of distress, which could only be mitigated by the relief afforded by the advantageous cultivation of the fertile lands in our colonies. He would enter more fully into the general question when he should bring forward a proposition for the vote of public money for promoting emigration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01383"><member>Mr. Warburton</member><membercontribution> bore testimony to the great industry and zeal of the right hon. gentleman, but could not concur in the reasoning upon which his motion was founded. The right hon. gentleman assumed that, if 1,200,000<i>l.</i> were appropriated, in any year, to assist the emigration of one hundred thousand paupers, the interest of that sum for the year would be but 60,000<i>l.</i>; whereas, if such paupers were to remain in this country chargeable upon the poor-rates, the cost of their maintenance would be not less than 300,000<i>l.</i>; and he calculated that the country would be, therefore, a gainer to the extent of 240,000<i>l.</i> But he altogether forgot the immeasureable proportion in which any such gain would be overbalanced by the enormous ratio in which population (especially where there was a vacuum, occasioned by the removal of a large body, to be filled up) was increasing, in all the old as well as new states of the world. In some of these it doubled itself in five-and-twenty years, which was at the rate of about three per cent per annum; in others the increase was as much as seventeen per cent. He did not mean to oppose the bringing in of the bill; but he suggested these as some of the difficulties with which the question was surrounded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01384"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> said, that he had not merely doubts, but an entire conviction that the plan proposed by the right
<image src="S2V0018P0I0784"/>
<col>1553</col>
hon. gentlemen was impracticable and futile. The right hon. gentleman was entitled to praise for his exertions; but unless his plan was extensively acted upon, it would be unavailing. He would leave individuals to go out at their own free choice. They knew the advantages held out for emigration, and if they thought proper to avail themselves of them they might do so; but he would not consent to the appropriation of eight or ten millions to such a purpose; and without such a sum the project could not be carried into effect. As to the expectation of a return of money from the emigrants who were supplied by a mortgage of the poor-rates, with the means of emigration, he considered it a mere delusion. He knew little of Ireland personally; but it appeared to him very strange that the people of that country should be reduced to starvation when they made such large exports of corn, butter, beef, cheese, &amp;c. Among other objections to the mortgage of the poor-laws was this&#x2014;that few persons would be disposed to locate in a parish which was subjected, besides the ordinary poor-rates, to a mortgage of those rates, on account of the inhabitants who had preceded them in the occupation of the parish.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01385"><member>Mr. Secretary Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, he was at a loss to know on what ground the hon. alderman expressed his surprise, that whilst Ireland exported the articles which he had mentioned, a portion of her population was reduced to great distress. It was not new, surely, in the science of political economy, that a portion of a community should have an excess of production which they might export or dispose of as they thought proper, and that another portion of that same community should be, notwithstanding that excess, or even a sufficiency, brought to a state of suffering from want of proper sustentation. The subject before the House was surrounded by a difficulty which attended another subject which had been discussed that evening; namely, that as the poor-laws were passed at different times, laws which were applicable at one period were not applicable at another. This was no less true with respect to emigration: it might be suited to some times and places, and be quite unsuited to others. For instance, some time ago, when distress prevailed amongst the manufacturers of Glasgow and other places in Scotland, and
<col>1554</col>
in the north of England, a proposition was made for their emigration. From the distress which prevailed in those districts when that proposition was made, he believed it would have been gladly received by those for whom that measure was intended. Now no distress prevailed in those manufacturing districts, and he believed this disposition to emigrate did not exist there now. The necessity of emigration, therefore, always bore a relation to times and places, and the purpose for which it was proposed to be carried into effect; in the same way that a redundant population bore a proportion to the means of giving them employment. He had been asked by his right hon. friend, whether he thought it would not be a beneficial use of the public money, to appropriate it to the emigration of a portion of our pauper population to the colonies? Before he should give a decisive answer to such a question, he should wish to be assured that the <i>data</i> on which his right hon. friend had grounded the assumption of benefit were clear and undoubted. If the plan of emigration were carried extensively into effect, would there not be reason to apprehend, that an extensive emigration to the colonies, by causing a glut of population there, and thereby creating a production beyond any demand the emigrants could obtain for it in an advantageous interchange with other countries, might lead to an equal degree of suffering with that from which it was sought to relieve them by sending them out? If the advantages pointed out by his right hon. friend could be obtained, and some disadvantage entailed at home, he would not say that money applied to the promotion of emigration would not be well laid out. But, as his right hon. friend intended to bring forward a proposition to that effect, he would postpone what he had to say on that subject until such a proposition came regularly before the House. He wished also to state, that he had felt the great force of an objection advanced by the hon. member for Bridport (Mr. Warburton); namely, the difficulty of observing an adequate proportion between the removal of a portion of the population, and the increase in the remaining population which supplied the vacuum that, by removal, had been created. The increase, it was well known, was more rapid after such a vacuum, than if it had not taken place. The right hon. gentleman proceeded to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0785"/>
<col>1555</col>
state, that in the United Netherlands, as well as in Russia, Germany, and all the northern countries of Europe, there was a very rapid increase of population: and all these countries, as well as England, were subject to the maintenance of a pauper population.&#x2014;The present bill, he admitted, was entitled to the utmost consideration; and what he approved of highly in it was, that it was a permissive and not an obligatory measure; and that there were several guards and checks to prevent any very rapid or perilous trial of the experiment. He would promise to bestow the most attentive consideration upon it, and whether or not the plan of his right hon. friend were adopted, the utmost praise was due to his right hon. friend for the ability and perseverance with which, amid the pressure of official duties, he had devoted himself to the benevolent object of ameliorating the condition of the pauper population of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01386"><member>Mr. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> was favourable to the principle of emigration, but thought it would be highly injurious to introduce the funding system into our parishes. A bad principle had already been established; namely, that of making up the wages of labourers out of the poor-rates. If to that evil, the mortgaging of the rates were to be added, the consequences would be of the most ruinous description.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01387"><member>Mr. Baring</member><membercontribution> said, he thought that much credit was due to the right hon. gentleman, for the perseverance with which he had applied himself to the removal of that which was certainly a great evil, namely, excessive population. To the principle of enabling the parishes to borrow money on the poor-rates, he decidedly objected. He believed that, by a small expense on the part of the government, a number of emigrants might be advantageously located in Canada. He had no doubt, that with some assistance, the gentlemen and farmers, in many parts of the country, would associate to send out the redundant poor; and that many persons might thus be sent out without the present bill, the principle of which, even if not dangerous, was, at least, alarming to the agricultural population. This, however, should be moderately done; for if pushed to a great extent, the machinery would become clogged, and would not work. The emigrating principle was not suitable to the manufacturing districts; it was suitable only to the agricultural parts of the country; to the men
<col>1556</col>
who could use the spade and the plough. But, although it might not be practicable to carry the plan to a great extent, to the extent to which it might be practicable to carry it, it would do good. For his own part, he anticipated great advantage from the discussion of the subject. He repeated, that he thought that, with very little assistance, a great number might be advantageously located in Canada. In various cases the United States had established swarms of colonists in the back Settlements of America, at an expense much greater than that which would attend the transfer of persons from this country to Canada.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01388"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, that the hon. gentleman had expressed so exactly the sentiments which he had always entertained on the subject of emigration, that it would be unnecessary for him to occupy the House for many minutes. He had always thought that emigration was an important consideration to a country like this, which had certainly a superabundant population, and at the same time possessed colonies of large extent and fertile soil. To such a country, so situated, good sense and prudence pointed out that encouragement ought to be given to voluntary emigration. It appeared by the evidence that a pauper, to whom 60<i>l.</i> was advanced, would, in all probability, be enabled at a certain period to repay it; but if men possessed of capital would emigrate voluntarily, he confessed he should prefer such a state of society in the colonies to one composed entirely of paupers. He could wish that the proposition of his right hon. friend were extended to the whole country. Why should it be confined to the county of Sussex? It was not coercive, but voluntary: let all, then, have the advantage of it. He was only afraid that the interest of the parish and that of government would be different. Government would be anxious that honest and industrious men should emigrate; but he feared that persons whose characters and habits were the reverse would be those whom the parish would wish to get rid of. For the sake of the experiment, industrious men ought to be sent out; and if some check were not kept on the parish, it appeared to him, that the object of his right hon. friend would not be answered. As to the parish ever being repaid, he was afraid there would be no chance of that; and he believed that his right hon. friend had held
<image src="S2V0018P0I0786"/>
<col>1557</col>
out no such hope. He should like to see men possessed, say of 5,000<i>l.</i> procure land in the colonies, and tempt others to go out as their labourers. He did not see that it was an objection to emigration, that the vacuum would soon be filled up. If he enlarged the sphere of civilization&#x2014;established a body of industrious labourers abroad, while he removed unproductive labourers from home, and opened new markets to the manufacture of the mother country&#x2014;then, he must submit, he had done good by emigration, even though the vacuum should be speedily filled up. Although he did not hope that any outlet could be made by which the population could be materially lessened at home, yet he did hope and believe, that in this way a voluntary and properly conducted emigration would be productive of benefit to the country. If he did not agree with his right hon. friend in all the details of his plan, he could not forget, that it was to his right hon. friend that the country was indebted for pointing out the benefits which would result from a well-conducted emigration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01389"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, he had always been an advocate for voluntary emigration, but objected to the advance of money by the government for the encouragement of it. If there was any one thing which more than another would render emigration objectionable, it was a mortgage like that now proposed. He considered this ten times worse than an advance of public, money. They had already seen the mischiefs which resulted from anticipating our resources: if this measure were adopted, it would place the whole of the landed proprietors in the same condition as the country was placed from the same cause. The measure was not voluntary but coercive; seeing that four fifths bound the rest. If emigration were to be coercive, he objected to it; and if not, they did not want any act upon the subject.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PENRYN DISFRANCHISEMENT BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01391"><member>The Earl of Carnarvon</member> moved the order of the day for the second reading of this bill. He said, that it was formed upon the model of the act which disfranchised Grampound; an act which established the important precedent of extinguishing a
<col>1558</col>
corrupt borough, and transferring the franchise to one of those populous districts which still remained without that privilege &#x2014;a circumstance almost throwing ridicule on the constitution of the country. Nor was the evil merely a theoretical one; for he had some time ago attended the progress of a bill relating to Manchester, upon which occasion great difficulty was experienced to carry the measure through its stages, in consequence of the want of representatives whose exertions could be relied on. He hoped, in the present instance, to be able to make a case out for their lordships to act upon, and he felt that hope more strongly from the circumstance, because the present bill had been brought up to their lordships' bar on the same day with that important hill which had been discussed yesterday, and the success of which formed an interesting era in the political life of the noble lord through, whose exertions the measure had been carried in the other House of parliament, and would give, he trusted, the death-blow to religious intolerance. He trusted, too, that their lordships' conduct with respect to the present bill would encourage, in the friends of extensive and radical reform, a hope that they, as well as the other House, were determined to detect a state of venality, supported by perjury, which at present prevailed over more than one half of the boroughs; and when detected, to put it down, and gradually to infuse something of the character of free representation into populous and unrepresented parts of the country. At the time when the representation of the country assumed its present form, the commerce of the country was contained in the boroughs of Cornwall; but now he believed they possessed no other commerce but that of sending members to parliament. If Manchester, at the time when those boroughs received the franchise, had arrived at its present importance, did their lordships conceive that it would not have obtained the privilege of representation; not from the hands of any radical reformer, but from those of the sovereign? He now moved, that counsel be called in.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01392">Counsel were accordingly called in, and the witnesses examined in support of the bill. After which, the further consideration of the evidence was postponed to Thursday.</p>

<title>NEW SOUTH WALES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01393"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> said, he held in his hand a petition from the gentry, merchants, tradesmen, &amp;c. of the colony of New South Wales, agreed to at a meeting called by the sheriff, and sanctioned by the government of that country. The prayer of the petition was, for popular representation, and for trial by jury. He had been informed by persons well acquainted with the subject, that the two Australian colonies embraced a population of from fifty-five to sixty-thousand persons, of which number, from thirty-five to forty-thousand were free settlers. The amount of the revenue derived by government from these persons was 60,000<i>l.</i> annually; and the produce of land and labour to 800,000<i>l.</i> He would say nothing on the prayer of the petition, further than that he knew of no one instance in the history of the English colonies, in which a colony, having attained to such importance as these had done, had been denied those invaluable privileges which belonged to them of right, as being British subjects. There were certainly colonies which had only received a semblance, instead of a reality, of the British constitution; but this had been under peculiar circumstances&#x2014;such as the colonies in Asia, which, perhaps, could not have had the spirit of the British constitution advantageously engrafted upon them. But with respect to those which were properly the colonies of England, he did not know an instance in which the privileges demanded by this petition had been withheld.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01394"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, that according, to the latest returns, the total amount of the population was but forty-nine thousand, and of that number eighteen thousand only were free settlers, the rest having forfeited their civil rights in this country, and being sent there as a punishment. He thought that this fact would not fail to have weight with the House, when it came to consider, whether it would be prudent to grant these two great benefits to the colonies. When an opportunity should occur, he would state to the House the reasons that induced him to think, that, instead of such a concession being a blessing to those colonies at present, it would operate to their disadvantage.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EAST INDIA COMPANY&#x2014;CASE OF MR. MILES O'REILLY.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01396"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> said, he held in his hand a petition containing the application of a private individual for redress. It was the petition of Miles O'Reilly, of Dublin, who had lost a large sum of money, in consequence of certain transactions which occurred at Madras; and he conceived he had a right, in fairness and in conscience, to claim a reparation from the directors of the East-India Company. Mr. O'Reilly had put this petition into his hands several years ago; and he had then told him, that his best course would be, to endeavour to procure redress by quiet and peaceable means. In consequence of that recommendation, he had succeeded in keeping Mr. O'Reilly from having the petition presented for three or four years; and he had done so from a hope, which was not yet extinguished, that the Court of Directors would, in that spirit of justice and fairness which characterized their conduct, attend to the claim of the petitioner. But as that body, no doubt from a sense of public duty, had refused to interfere, all he could do was to lay the petition before the House; and he hoped that the statement contained in it, and the discussion upon it, might have the effect of convincing the high and honourable men to whom one very important branch of the public interest was intrusted, that there was, in this instance, if not a legal at least an equitable claim on them, to pay to Mr. O'Reilly, out of the funds of the company, the sum of which he had been deprived. There was, in a statute passed in the 39th and 40th of the late king, a clause which directed the registrar of the king's court to sue out letters of administration, when any person residing in the presidency happened to die intestate. That clause was intended, and, he believed, had the effect of preventing property thus left from suffering that havoc and destruction, with which it might otherwise be visited; since it was placed in the hands of those whose duty it was to take care of it, and to see that it was given up to the right owners. But when the property of individuals was thus, by a legal enactment, taken out of that course and channel in which otherwise it would naturally flow,&#x2014;when the care of private money was intrusted to a public officer, &#x2014;then, not only that public officer, but all the agents of the government by whom he was appointed, were bound to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0788"/>
<col>1561</col>
watch over the property thus taken from individuals, with the most anxious care. It happened in this case, that colonel O'Reilly, the brother of the petitioner, died in 1816, leaving behind him a moderate property; which, as he died intestate, would descend to his next heir. Mr. Ricketts, the registrar of the court at Madras, took out letters of administration, and then took possession of the colonel's estate, which he invested in the company's treasury at Madras. That act rendered him the trustee of the property, by virtue of the office he held; and those who gave them the authority so to appoint him, namely, the directors, were in fairness and justice, if not in strict law, answerable for any loss which the property might sustain, in consequence of want of due care and vigilance. Soon afterwards, Mr. Ricketts, whose affairs were embarrassed, went to the treasury, and took out a large part of this property. In a short time after he died insolvent, leaving no security for the money, and without any assets. In conquence, the whole of this money, about 3,000<i>l.</i>, was lost. An important circumstance in the case was this, that the treasury paid the money to the registrar without any rule or order of court made to that effect. The judges of the court admitted, by a paper which was still in existence, that there ought to have been an order: and two of the former judges of the court at Madras, now living, sir T. Strange and sir E. Stanley, had declared in the court, that, in consequence of the money being taken from the treasury without an order, the directors became answerable. Surely this was but reasonable. If the treasurer had said, "I cannot pay you without an order from the court; it is not your money; it is vested in me for the benefit of others&#x2014; go and get a rule authorizing me to pay it," what would have been the consequence? Why, probably, it would have prevented this unfortunate, man from making such an application; or, if he did apply for a rule, the court would have said, "Show us what the money is wanted for; prove to us your solvency and efficiency." Then Mr. Ricketts would have been called on for security; and if he did not lay sufficient grounds before the court, his application would have been refused, and the property saved. If the treasury made itself liable for this money, ought it not to have exercised thus much vigilance? If it were pot vigilant to that extent, why then
<col>1562</col>
it appeared to him that there was no vigilance at all. Now, he did not think it would be denied, that the Court of Directors, who appointed the government, and the government under whom Mr. Ricketts had been suffered to act in this manner, were responsible for any injury that might be incurred, by want of proper attention. That they were legally responsible, he was not bound to show; but leaving the legality aside, he would contend, that, in liberality and equity, they were bound to consider the case of the family of one of their old and faithful servants, who had sustained a heavy loss by the gross negligence (he would not say moral misconduct), and want of care of the public money. By his advice several statements of the case had been made to the Court of Directors, and all the facts were admitted by their secretary, Mr. Dart, but no redress followed. Another thing that strengthened Mr. O'Reilly's claim for compensation was this&#x2014;that Mr. Ricketts, by whom the loss was sustained, was appointed to the office contrary to the wish of sir T. Strange, a judge nominated by the king, who wished another gentleman to fill the office. But the mayor and aldermen, who were the servants of the company, outvoted him, and appointed the person who caused this loss. Another circumstance to which he called the attention of the House was this: by the act of parliament, which gave this power to the registrar, it was enacted, that he should publish an account of all monies paid into his hands on account of intestates, first in the India newspapers, and then as soon as possible in the London Gazette, in order to give warning to the relations of individuals so deceased, throughout Europe. Colonel O'Reilly died intestate in 1816, and yet five years elapsed before the advertisement appeared. What could have been the object of inserting the advertisement after such a delay? The whole use of this regulation was, that speedy information should be given to the relatives of the deceased, by which embezzlement or dilapidation of property might be prevented. If this advertisement had been inserted the next year, this small fortune might have been rescued from the hands of the registrar. He only mentioned this as a part of the general grievance which would be removed if the law were adhered to. Under all circumstances, he hoped that the statements he had made, and the discussion that might ensue, would
<image src="S2V0018P0I0789"/>
<col>1563</col>
have the effect of inducing the East India Company not to depart on the present occasion From that practice of liberality and justice which had generally characterized their conduct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01397"><member>Mr. Denison</member><membercontribution> said, that a friend of his, a Mr. Sinclair, had a brother who, after residing many Years in India, died without a will. This registrar, who took possession of his property, which amounted to ten thousand pagodas, died insolvent, and his friend had never been able to obtain redress, tie petitioned the Board of Control, who referred him to the East India Company; but they told him that Mr. Ricketts was no officer of theirs, but was appointed by the King's Court at Madras. It was extremely hard that people should thus be deprived of their property, without any fault or neglect of their own. In his opinion, the persons concerned in these two cases had, by every consideration of law, equity, and liberality, a claim upon the East India Company.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01398"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> said, that the deficiencies of Mr. Ricketts amounted to 40,000<i>l.</i>, which had been abstracted from the property of the widows and children of the persons whose effects he had, as registrar, administered. The subject was one of great difficulty, and he hardly knew on whom the claim for redress should be made. What the honourable baronet had said of the manner in which Mr. Ricketts had been appointed, had no bearing on the case. By an act which was passed in 1800&#x2014;an act brought forward by government and not by the East India Company, it was enacted that, as persons in India had commonly few relatives who could undertake the administration of their effects, that office should devolve on a public officer, and the duty was thrown upon the registrar. The judges naturally appointed the existing officer of the Recorder's court. He could not help regretting that when this duty was put upon the registrar, the judges did not take an adequate pecuniary security from him. The practice at present was, that the registrar gave such security, and that no money should be drawn out of the treasury without an order of court. But now came the question, who was to make the loss good? If, a similar case having happened in this country, the government would have had to redress the injured party, then, indeed, he thought the petitioner must be redressed by the East India Company. If not, he did not
<col>1564</col>
think the petitioner had any claim on the Company. This was not a question of liberality. Unless a sufficient case was made out, the Company could not, consistently with their duty, reimburse the petitioner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01399"><member>Mr. Courtenay</member><membercontribution> observed, that in speaking of this case, he would say, as he had said upon another which had been referred to a committee, that where there was a wrong for which there was no remedy, the proper course was to appeal to that House. He was therefore glad that the subject had been brought before them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01400"><member>Mr. L. Foster</member><membercontribution> contended, that the money having been lodged in the hand of the Company's own treasurer, this was an appeal to something more than to their liberality. The attention of the Commons of England had been called to a gross wrong, and he hoped that the appeal which had been made to the feelings of the Company would not be lost upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01401"><member>Mr. Lindsay</member><membercontribution> did not think the Company liable for the actions of an officer whom they had not appointed. The more the case was looked into, the more clearly it would appear, that the Company were not liable for the misdeeds of an officer over whom they had no control.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01402"><member>Mr. Trant</member><membercontribution> said, if it could be shown that there had been the slightest neglect on the part of any of the officers of the Company, then it was quite clear that the petitioner had a fair and equitable claim.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01403"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> protested against the supposition, that the petitioner supposing his case to be made out, could have any claim upon the government.

<title>NEW SOUTH WALES BILL.]</title>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01405"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> said, that at a future day he should move two instructions to the committee. The first would be, that the committee should introduce a clause into the bill, extending the trial by jury to criminal and civil cases in the Colony; and the second, that a clause should be received, providing the election of a cer-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0790"/>
<col>1565</col>
tain number, say one third, of the members of the Legislative Council, by individuals whose incomes from real or personal property should not be less than 50<i>l.</i> a-year. There were certain points in the bill which he disliked. The trial by jury, for instance, had existed, for the purpose of quarter sessions, before this bill was introduced; but now it was to be abandoned. No mention was made either of the laws relative to insolvency or bankruptcy in the colony, as to which subjects he thought many new regulations might with advantage be made. Upon the whole, he considered the bill as retrograding rather from the spirit of liberality, than taking any step in advance of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01406"><member>Mr. N. Calvert</member><membercontribution> doubted whether the colony was yet in a state to profit by those institutions which the learned member proposed, though there could be no doubt that, as soon as it was in such a state, it ought to receive them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01407"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, that the regulations with respect to bankruptcy and insolvency were omitted in the bill, because he thought the colonial legislature better calculated to regulate those subjects than the House of Commons. His great object had been to meddle as little with details as possible, which were always much better arranged upon the spot. As to the trial by jury, the system had been tried in quarter sessions, and, from the peculiar state of society in that country, found altogether inapplicable. The time was not yet come in which the machinery of that valuable institution could be extended to New South Wales with effect; and to attempt to introduce it would only be to destroy a system which was suited to circumstances, and practically worked well already. No person could be better inclined than he was to give the colony the advantage of every institution which the mother-country possessed; but by attempting to go too fast at first, the progress of the good work would be retarded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01408"><member>Mr. Bright</member><membercontribution> complained that the bill threw too much power into the hands of the Crown and of the privy council, and needlessly limited the other branches of the legislature in their power of interference. There were certain provisions, too, in it, to which he particularly objected; and amongst others, to that which took away the present Court of Appeal, and enacted that all appeals should be direct to the privy council in England. He particularly
<col>1566</col>
objected to this arrangement, and thought that, if it was to be insisted upon, some change ought to be made in the constitution of the privy council, which was certainly as badly constituted for the purposes of a Court of Appeal, as it was possible to imagine any tribunal to be. He disliked the bill altogether, and would be better pleased that it should be passed for a limited period than be made perpetual.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01409"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> said, that the present measure would not take from the House of Commons the power of future legislation on the subject. As to the intermediate appeal, at the present moment, there was a supreme court of Law in the colony, consisting of barristers of a certain standing, appointed for the purpose of administering the English law. From their decision there was an appeal to the military governor, who could not be supposed to be well acquainted with the principles of law. If his decision confirmed the judgment of the court it would be unnecessary: but if he reversed it, no person would consider that full justice was done, and therefore that absurd practice was to be put an end to, and the appeal would lie in the usual way of appeals from the colonies to this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01410"><member>Mr. Spring Rice</member><membercontribution> agreed that it would be desirable to make the measure a temporary one. The colony of New South Wales must be considered in a double light: first, as a penal colony, and then as a colony of increasing wealth and importance, and which ought to be dealt with as a society of free, unpolluted men, of course not subject to that peculiar legislation which befitted a penal colony, Such were the present advantages of the colony, that he had seen many letters from, persons, who had been transported thither, inviting their friends in this country to join them. It is evident that the time must come when New South Wales could no longer be considered as a penal colony, and, therefore, when the whole course of government and legislation with respect to it, must undergo a change. It was on that account that he wished the measure to be a temporary one, in order that a more enlarged and liberal course might in future be taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01411"><member>Colonel Davies</member><membercontribution> said, it was a mockery to hold out that colony as a place of punishment, seeing that the convicts wrote to their friends to leave no means untried,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0791"/>
<col>1567</col>
even to the commission of crime, to get themselves sent out thither. What he would suggest would be, that they should send out free labourers to cultivate it. So great was the desire to obtain those free labourers, that an agent of the Agricultural Society had offered to take out five thousand families free of expense, provided proper grants of lands were allotted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01412"><member>Mr. Wilmot Horton</member><membercontribution> said, that nothing could be more erroneous than the belief that the present state of the convicts in New South Wales was such that they no longer considered it a place of punishment. The very reverse was the fact. So far were the convicts from wishing to induce their friends in this country to qualify themselves for being sent out, by the commission of crime, that their letters were filled with complaints of their altered condition, and of the severity of their treatment. Their condition might have been different before the establishment of the internal secondary punishment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01413"><member>Mr. Marryat</member><membercontribution> expressed his satisfaction at finding that the inhabitants of New South Wales were, in the estimation of government, so improved in morals and good conduct as to be deemed worthy of being intrusted with such political privileges as were proposed in the bill. He trusted the new council would restrain those acts of arbitrary power which had too generally characterized the conduct of the governors of our distant colonies; and he hoped that this measure was the commencement of a new and improved system of colonial legislation. He would, however, call the attention of the House to the state of our other foreign possessions, and put in a claim to their being admitted to similar political privileges. The colony of Trinidad had been specially reserved as a field of experimental legislation, and though it certainly was intended to apply merely to the point of the melioration of the slave population, yet that unfortunate colony had been subjected to every possible species of experiment. English governors and judges had been sent out to execute and administer Spanish laws without any previous knowledge of the Spanish language. Orders in council had been issued to adapt English laws to Spanish jurisprudence, and such confusion existed, that on the examination of the two judges before the commissioners of legal inquiry, they differed <i>toto c&#x0153;lo</i>, as to what was the existing law

of the colony, there being no collection of these orders open to the public. The governor, moreover, by way of experiment, was invested with powers most extraordinary and unconstitutional. Besides the executive power representing the king, he engrossed the legislative power by his control of the council; and being president of the Cabildo, he levied taxes at will; and, as if these immense privileges were insufficient, he was invested with the high judicial offices of chief judge of many of the courts, and judge of appeal in all. Vested with such unlimited powers, it was not in the nature of man not to abuse them; and, without any personal reflection upon sir Ralph Woodford, the colony under his administration had suffered great oppression; the taxes had been quintupled, new offices had been created at his will and pleasure, for the support of which additional exactions had been imposed. The taxes in that colony amounted to 150,000<i>l.</i> currency, while in the neighbouring island of Grenada they did not exceed 35,000<i>l.</i> currency.&#x2014;The hon. member then referred to the proceedings respecting the Crown lands, in the report of the commissioners. It appeared there, that he, by a simple proclamation, declared all the titles to the estates in the colony to be had or defective, called upon the proprietors to exhibit their title-deeds to the inspection of the Attorney-general for the colony, and directed proceedings to be instituted in the court over which he himself presided as judge, to decide upon their validity. He decreed such lands as were judged to be defective in title liable to confiscation to the Crown, and subjected the proprietors to the payment of heavy fines and quit-rents. In consequence, however, of representations to the government by merchants and planters at home, who did not relish this experiment upon their rights and properties, this proclamation was suspended, and finally annulled. The report of the commissioners completely exposed the conduct of the governor in this proceeding; but, strange to say, it did not recommend any compensation being granted to those proprietors, who, like good and loyal subjects, paid the fines imposed upon them, while those who contumaciously resisted had come off scot free. The commissioners seemed to have felt a professional horror at refunding a fee, however illegally and unjustly exacted. By some informality in the com-

mission, they were precluded from inquiring into the complaints of the English occupants; many of whose grievances were much greater than those of the Spanish settlers. The foreign colonies were placed in a peculiar situation; they were not represented in parliament, and had yet no legislature of their own. The office of colonial agent had become a sinecure, by the appointment resting with government and not with the colonists: they had no constitutional means of stating their grievances but through their governors to the Colonial office. The governor, however, had influence enough to stifle any such representation in the colony, while merchants and others residing at home were deterred from making remonstrances, which were transmitted abroad by the Colonial office, from the ill-will and vexatious persecutions they led to on the part of the governor and his adherents, towards their connexions and interests there. The present Secretary for the Colonies would signalize his administration by putting an end to the present, system. In the case of Trinidad, a great deal was not asked for; any change almost would be for the better. While the inhabitants were mostly Spanish, some plea existed for retaining Spanish laws; now they were chiefly British; give them British laws, and the benefits of a British constitution; let the colony in future be a field for improvement, and cease to be a field of experiment. There was a Spanish proverb that said, "to the thirsty any thing is wine." Surely it was not too much to ask from a British legislature, civil liberty and personal protection, and <i>habeas corpus</i>, and at least to do away with the horrid possibility of imprisonment for life, which the want of a <i>habeas corpus</i> now vested in the power of the governor.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ROMAN CATHOLIC LAND-TAX BILL.]</title>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01416"><member>The Attorney-general</member><membercontribution> observed, that there was no proof that the Roman Catholic suffered by the law as it now stood. Before he could admit that, he must see it proved that the Catholic was assessed higher than his Protestant neighbour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01417"><member>Mr. G. Bankes</member><membercontribution> observed, that the remark of his learned friend came at a very late period of the bill, and it was one which he did not expect from him, seeing that he had before assented to the principle of
<col>1570</col>
the measure. It was true that complaints had been made by Protestants, as well as Catholics, of unequal assessments of the Land-tax. Those complaints were made, in the time of sir Robert Walpole, who had described the tax as being, in many instances, heavy and intolerable, and had added, that more country gentlemen were ruined by it than by any other similar means. Mr. Pitt, when he brought forward his perpetual Land-Tax bill, admitted the inequalities of the rate; but said that the exigencies of the state did not admit of its diminution. The inequality that subsisted, between Protestants in many cases, rendered it difficult for Catholics to show they had been oppressively rated. Much, he thought, depended upon ascertaining the fact, whether the assessments had been made subsequent or previous to the reign of William and Mary. He was inclined to the opinion, that they were made subsequently to that period, and on that ground he argued for their alteration; for if then made, they must have been manifestly made unequally, as regarded the Roman Catholics. If the assessments were made prior to the reign of William 3rd, it might appear unreasonable now to expect their modification or reduction. Government, though not disposed to go the length indicated in the present bill, might be willing to give the Roman Catholics the same degree of relief as it afforded them in 1794; but with that, which was a very inadequate species of relief, they could hardly be expected to be satisfied. The relief of 1794 was founded on the statute of Anne; and, considering the difference that had taken place in the value of money and land in the interval that had elapsed since that period, it could not be considered in the light of relief at the present day. It would be better for the parties to go on as at present, than to be put off with an inefficient remedy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01418"><member>The Solicitor-general</member><membercontribution> said, that if the subject had been agitated earlier, he was convinced the bill would never have proceeded so far as it had done. No man could be more averse to imposing taxes upon Catholics heavier than upon Protestants; but he would maintain, that with respect to the Land-tax, they laboured under a very slight grievance. In 1794, relief was given to Catholics doubly assessed, and it was continued to them by the bill of 1798, which made the Land-tax perpetual. It was to be supposed that

<col>1571</col>
all Catholics who felt themselves aggrieved, had availed themselves of the remedy afforded by law. If there were any who had not done so, he should have no objection to their being relieved But the hon. member wished to assume as a principle, that because the Catholics were doubly taxed in the reign of king William, they were to be doubly taxed now; and that half their present assessment being taken off, they would then be on a par with the Protestants. He denied the accuracy of this proposition, and should object to any bill founded upon it. The returns showed that the Catholics were but very little aggrieved, and that the hon. gentleman's views were erroneous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01419"><member>Mr. G.

He would rather hope that, on some future day, the government would have a better opportunity of turning their attention to the subject, and would be satisfied that what he asked for was founded in reason and justice. He did not think, therefore, that he should at present press the matter further. He would, however, consult his friends, and, in the meantime, move that the bill be engrossed, and read a third time on Monday se'nnight.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CORPORATION AND TEST ACTS<lb/> REPEAL BILL.]</title><p id="S2V0018P0-01421"><member>Lord Holland</member> moved the order of the day for going into a committee on this bill.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01422"><member>The Earl of Rosebery</member><membercontribution> said, that before the bill went into the committee, he was desirous of saying a few words upon the general principles and provisions of the Test and Corporation acts, particularly as they affected Scotland; for, notwithstanding all that had been urged, on more than one occasion, by the noble and learned lord (Eldon), he still continued to think, and was ready to maintain, that the interests of the people of Scotland were materially concerned in these statutes, and that but for the annual bill of Indemnity, they would inevitably suffer to a great extent, from the consequences which naturally flowed from them. He offered himself, perhaps, to their lordships for this purpose the more readily, as it so
<col>1572</col>
happened, that though connected with Scotland himself, both by birth and property, he had been educated a member of the Church of England, and had always preferred its constitution, discipline, and liturgy to the government of the Church of Scotland, without any liturgy at all, though he believed, in point of doctrine, very little, if any, difference existed between the two, both preaching the pure principles of the Christian faith. His observations, therefore, whether they were correct or erroneous, were at least disinterested and sincere. Upon this branch of the subject then&#x2014;the connection of these acts with the rights and interests of the inhabitants of Scotland&#x2014;it was only necessary for their lordships to inquire in what situation they would be placed, if the enactments of them were really enforced, next to ask, what were the engagements entered into between the two countries at the period of the Union, and then to recollect what was not only expected from, but what was uniformly complied with by the sovereign of this realm, on his accession to the throne, and the result would shew such a mixture of contradiction, as well as of injustice, that neither would have been tolerated to this hour but for the intervention of the annual Indemnity, which came in to mitigate these evils, and to counteract these inconsistencies. For what are the facts which induced him to make this broad statement? In the first place, then, the people of Scotland, under the operation of the Test and Corporation acts, are debarred from holding any civil employment in the southern division of the island, or of serving their country in the army or navy&#x2014;that is, they must either renounce their religious tenets, or abandon their political, or professional, pursuits: but then, by the Act of Union, they are indulged with the hope and expectation, or rather promise, that this is not to be the case (which would be only a vain and delusive one, except for the Act of Indemnity) as it is declared in the most express terms by that treaty, that the rights, privileges and advantages of both countries shall be reciprocal; and lastly comes the fact of his majesty's being bound immediately on mounting the throne to make a most solemn declaration, that he will maintain the Presbyterian as the established religion of Scotland, although he is to be incapacitated on account of that very religion which he undertakes in that solemn man-

<col>1573</col>
ner to recognise and maintain, from conferring any commission in his army or navy, and from granting any office under the Crown in England, on the subjects of the northern part of the kingdom. Surely this is an anomaly never before heard of in a state guided by rational or consistent counsels, and is such a restraint, imposed on the natives of Scotland, that he thought the right rev. prelate (Lincoln), who the other evening drew a distinction between restraint and punishment, would concur with him in describing this to be a punishment to which the Scotch ought not to be subjected. Putting, therefore, for the moment, out of the question the case of the Dissenters from the Church of England in this country, he requested, on behalf of the people of Scotland, to say, that as they had a religion established by law, and as they were incorporated with England so as to form but one country, they were entitled, as a matter of strict right, to the enjoyment of every office or situation which could be held by the subject of any part of the kingdom&#x2014;that any thing-short of this was a stigma on them, and therefore a hardship and injustice. In this view, he considered the Scotch as far more aggrieved by the enactments of the Test and Corporation laws than the Dissenters in England, in as much as the former live under an established religion, and form a national church, by their adherence to which, they are excluded from political, naval, or military advancement. The other points connected with the general question, had been so exhausted by the perspicuous and comprehensive speech of the noble baron who had introduced the bill to the notice of the House, a speech not less distinguished by the tone of moderation and temper which it displayed, than by the unanswerable arguments by which he supported his principles and conclusions, that he should sum up what further he had to say, by declaring that he assented to this measure of relief, for the object of enabling his majesty to exercise his just prerogative without doubt or impediment, with a view of strengthening the Church of England, by putting an end to the feelings of jealousy and irritation which he feared were now entertained by those who dissented from her, and as the best method of preventing the greatest of all national evils, religious exasperation and hatred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01423"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> said, that the ques-
<col>1574</col>
tion then before their lordships, as it regarded Scotland, was an excessively delicate question. When the Act of Union took place, the Scotch were extremely anxious to take care that no Englishman, looking to the statute of William and Mary, should have any thing to do with any office in Scotland, unless he first subscribed their confession of faith. On the other hand, the English were equally desirous that the people of Scotland should not be admitted into office in this country. If their lordships would look back at the discussions which took place in 1787, 1789, and 1790, they would find that a great deal was then said about what the Act of Union permitted. All that he would then say, however, was, that the Act of Union was extremely cautious to provide that no alteration should be made in the Scotch Church Establishment, and that no persons should be admitted to office in that country, unless they first subscribed the confession of faith. There was a Test in that country, therefore, on the same principle as the test for holding office in this country. He saw with abhorrence, that there were to be in this country academies and universities, without religion being taught in them, because it was stated that no one could tell what Christianity was; and when he saw that persons holding offices in Scotch universities were connected with these new academics, he could not help expressing his astonishment, that they should ever have had the honour of holding those offices, It was stated in the Act of Union, that the Church of England was to be inviolably preserved. But how? It was not merely a simple declaration; it was a declaration, that it should be preserved by the laws and statutes there mentioned; and with respect to the laws there mentioned, it was not confined to them, but there was an express declaration, that every law and statute passed in this country for the purpose of the preservation of the establishment of the Church of England&#x2014;not merely for the purpose of the preservation of its worship, discipline, and government, but for the preservation of the Church itself&#x2014;should remain inviolate for ever. He was perfectly ready to admit, that no legislator could legislate inviolably for posterity; but, on the other hand, the use of that word was a caution to posterity, not without sufficient and ample reasons, to inno-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0795"/>
<col>1575</col>
vate against laws which were understood to be the fundamental laws of the country; and if there were those who could find out that the Corporation and Test acts were not acts for the preservation of the establishment of the Church of Eng-: land, he could only say, that those persons had gone much further in the march of intellect than the humble individual who; now addressed their lordships. That march had certainly been both very rapid and very slow. Their lordships would; recollect that from the year 1662 to the year 1828, pretty nearly two centuries, it had never been found out, by those who were charged to take care of the established Church of England, except by one or two individuals, and it had never been found out by those who were charged with the interest of the Church of Scotland, that the Test and Corporation acts were a desecration of the sacrament: but within one week their opinion had been entirely changed. The march of intellect, in the latter case, had certainly been exceedingly rapid, however slow it might have been in the first instance. It was very true, that his majesty, on his accession to the throne, solemnly declared that he would preserve the Presbyterian church; but it was equally true, that his majesty undertook to keep inviolate the establishment of the Church of England; and when their lordships had on their table a thousand petitions&#x2014;he knew, though he would not state, how they had been obtained&#x2014;stating that it was a degradation to any man, and against all principle with respect to government, to have such tests, their lordships, he hoped, would let him remind them, that his majesty was obliged to take the Sacrament, and before he began to exercise the royal functions was I obliged to submit to that which those petitions stated to be a degradation. Why did their lordships impose it upon the king, if they considered it improper to; subject persons to it who filled inferior offices? He contended, that it had become part of the constitution of this country, as established at the Revolution, Now, with respect to king William, it was true that he objected to the test after he came to the throne; but while he was prince of Orange he never made any such objection, and when he did object, after becoming king, the legislature would not hear of his objection. With regard to his friends, the Scotch, he thought they
<col>1576</col>
had no right to complain, for they had certainly always had a tolerably fair share of offices amongst them, notwithstanding this test, so much complained of. The question however was this&#x2014;whether, under the effect of acts of parliament, passed for the security of our constitution, we had or had not more security than we ought? Now, his opinion was, that the Church of England, combined with the state, formed together the constitution of Great Britain, and that the Test and Corporation acts were necessary to the preservation of that constitution. His noble friends said, it was time enough when any danger to the constitution arose, to legislate for that danger; but he could never agree to that doctrine: he would rather rest the safety of the constitution on those securities with which it was at present surrounded, than run any risks, on the chance of future legislation. He therefore entreated those who were the guardians of the Church, to pause before they allowed her to be stripped of these safeguards, by which she had been so long protected; lest, those miseries, from which we had so happily been rescued, should return; in which case they would have to look again to the restoration of the constitution, such as it was established in the time of Charles 2nd, and look, perhaps, for such restoration in vain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01424"><member>Lord Holland</member><membercontribution> said, that what had fallen from the learned earl required that he should trouble their lordships with a few words in explanation: and first, he wished the clerk to turn to an entry on he Journals of the 16th of March, 1689. The noble earl argued, that one of the great objects of the Revolution was to support these particular laws. Now, when king William came down to the House to give the royal assent to the bill for annulling the attainder of lord Russell, he addressed them in these memorable words:&#x2014;" I am, with all the expedition I can, filling up the vacancies that are in offices and places of trust by this Revolution. I know you are sensible there is a necessity of some law to settle the oaths to be taken by all persons to be admitted to such places. I recommend it to your care to make a speedy provision for it; and as I doubt not but you will sufficiently provide against Papists, so I hope you will leave room for the admission of all Protestants that are willing and able to serve." The noble earl had said, that the present objections
<image src="S2V0018P0I0796"/>
<col>1577</col>
to this test were the consequence of the "march of intellect;" but let him look to the protests entered on the Journals of that House, and he would find if the word "desecration" meant the same as "profanation," that no five successive years had elapsed since the Revolution, in which the term was not applied to this test, either in protests, motions, or petitions. The noble earl, in referring to the circumstances of the union with Scotland, had left out one most important fact,&#x2014;namely, that on the clause being read, in which were introduced the act of the 2nd of Elizabeth and another act, it was moved in the House of Commons, that the Corporation and Test acts should also be named in it; but which motion was rejected by the House. A similar motion was made in this House, and was attended with a similar result. But, said the noble earl, parliament was precluded, by the Union, from repealing these laws. Now the words of the Act of Union were, "until parliament shall otherwise direct." And then his noble friend had said, that the constitution of this country was contained in those statutes. Now, he held that the constitution of this country consisted in this&#x2014;that the King, Lords, and Commons possessed the power of making laws and statutes; not that the statutes when so made were the constitution. Were, then, the Corporation and Test acts the constitution of this, country? Would his noble friend maintain, then, that Fortescue and sir E. Coke did not live under the British constitution, because those great men had lived before those laws were made? If they were not the constitution, then the repeal of them could not be said to be a repeal of the constitution. Their lordships would find that the same objections which his noble friend had attributed, with a sneer, "to the march of intellect," existed two centuries ago. They would find that intellect had marched as far as that, at the very time when the Test act was passed, and still more so at the period of William 3rd. Why, if their lordships were to hear what the great whigs of that day, who were objects of so much admiration with his noble friend, said on the subject, they would find their language much stronger than any which was to be found in the numerous petitions upon the table. They would find that they designated it as "a profanation," not "a desecration,"
<col>1578</col>
perhaps; for that term he believed belonged, to the march of intellect; but the same arguments were used then as at the present day. He was surprised, therefore, to hear his noble friend treat the objections to it as something new. As he before said, king William himself recommended this proceeding. The opposite party, however, said they would provide for the Dissenters in another way; and were it not for that promise, the great man at the head of the government (for a great man he certainly was) would have insisted on the Test and Corporation acts being repealed. Such was also the feeling of George 1st, and the leading men of that time; but many obstacles arose, and accidental circumstances, which disappointed the hopes of the Dissenters. As to our having, at the union with Scotland, bound ourselves to preserve those acts inviolate, such was not the fact. It had certainly been an endeavour on the part of lord. Nottingham to introduce those two laws into the articles of Union, but without success, the object being to defeat the Union altogether. When their lordships found that the effort of that party to introduce those acts was a part of their tactics to get rid of that measure, it afforded a strong proof that those acts ought to have been repealed. Yet, now their lordships were to be told, that they were as much concluded by those acts, as by those which appeared on the face of the Act of Union. He hoped, therefore, that no act passed so recently as the reign of Charles 2nd would be deemed as an inviolable part of the constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01425"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> said, he had never stated, that the constitution was formed by the laws and statutes. What he had always said was, that the constitution, as it had existed for a considerable period of time, was a constitution consisting of the union of the State and the Established Church, and that they were united by laws for the preservation of the constitution so acknowledged and so established. If their lordships thought proper to change the constitution they might do so; but he would not be accessary to any such deed. He must act on his own opinion, and he would say, without hesitation, as he hoped to answer to God and his country, that if every man in that House supported the bill, he alone would go below the bar and vote against it. He had not denied that king William had recommended mea-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0797"/>
<col>1579</col>
sures for the relief of the Dissenters: he had only compared the declaration of William prince of' Orange, with the speech of king William; and when he looked at both those documents, and saw what parliament haddone, and what they had forborne to do, he adhered to his former statement. The parliament, notwithstanding that recommendation, had shown, by the laws they had passed and preserved, that it was their determination to maintain that constitution, which was the constitution of this country from that moment to this. He knew a message had been sent by Charles the 2nd to parliament&#x2014;not proposing to admit Dissenters to office, for that they "were expressly refused&#x2014;but certainly proposing some measures of ease for them: a bill was brought into parliament for their relief, which did not pass. It did pass, however, in the first year of William and Mary. He did not hesitate to state that the Sacramental Test was of the most sacred nature, and if any body could propose another test, equally strong, to be substituted, God forbid that he should object to it. What he said was, that it was matter of surprise to him, that, down to this period certain lords in that House had never come forward until now, to say that this was a species of test that ought not to exist. All he would say was, that no consideration on this side of the grave should induce him ever to be a party to such a separation between the Church and State as this bill would effect, unless such an alteration were introduced into it as: would enable them to hand down to posterity that Church in a state of security equal to that in which they had received it from their ancestors, and which had produced so large a share of happiness, not only to this empire, but to every part of the world. All he looked for was, that the constitution should be secured: provided that were accomplished, he was not struggling for this test or that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01426"><member>Lord Melville</member><membercontribution> said, he considered it necessary that their lordships should understand exactly what the law required in Scotland as to religious qualifications. He entirely agreed with his noble friend who had commenced the discussion as to the justice of the claims of the people of Scotland to the repeal of the Test act. But they had not the same right to complain of the Corporation act; and though their lordships' table was loaded with petitions, they were not all for the repeal of the Cor-
<col>1580</col>
poration act. He had presented one himself from Edinburgh, only for the repeal of the Test act. By one of the articles of Union with Scotland it was stipulated, that the people of that country should not be subjected, in Scotland, to any religious Test whatever. The parliament of Great Britain was not at liberty, therefore, to extend any such Test to Scotland. But it seemed that the claim of the people of Scotland was considered really intrusive. The House had been told, that they already had rather too many English offices. But that was a sort of language against which he must protest. With regard to civil offices, there were those of the judges, justices, sheriffs, and many others, to which there was no reason why natives of Scotland, long residing in England, and having acquired property here, should not be eligible. Again, were they to be told that commissions in the army and navy were English offices; and that the people of Scotland, who were called on to serve the state, would be unable to hold a commission but for the Annual Indemnity bills? This was a proposition he should be astonished to hear in any quarter whatever. If his majesty happened to be in Scotland, and any office became vacant, the appointment, there could be no doubt, would hot be liable to the Test act. The king might bestow the seals of a secretaryship of state on any person under those circumstances, without His being subject to the operation of the Test act. He was anxious to explain the circumstances attending the offices to which his learned friend had alluded as being, under an act of king William, subject to a religious test, There were certain offices, the holders of which were obliged to subscribe a profession of faith of the Scotch Church, but this Test was confined to Ecclesiastical offices, and the professors in the universities, and, perhaps, to parochial schoolmasters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01427"><member>The Earl of Falmouth</member><membercontribution> assured his noble friends who belonged to Scotland, that he did not rise to call them intruders; all he would say on that head was, that if intruders at all, they were very useful ones, and that on some occasions he hardly knew what this country would have done without them. With respect to the bill before the House, the opinions he entertained had been so ably advocated on a late occasion, that he had then felt it unnecessary to trouble their lordships with
<image src="S2V0018P0I0798"/>
<col>1581</col>
them. He had been particularly gratified by the speech of the noble and learned lord (Eldon) whose conviction was the result of long observation, and of experience in matters of state policy, hardly equalled by that of any living man: if this conviction was also the result of an ardent, perhaps enthusiastic, attachment to the main principles of the constitution, it was not on that account that it would have the less influence with him. Upon the expediency of this bill he would only observe, that, if he had rightly understood the noble duke at the head of the government, it appeared the principle reason with him for thinking it expedient, had been, that such was the feeling of the other House of Parliament. It might be right sometimes that a minister of the Crown should attach due weight to such a feeling, but their lordships knew too well the principles upon which their value and importance in the state depended, not to be cautious how they admitted the doctrine, that the will of the House of Commons ought to prevail with them there. No man could feel more respect for that branch of the legislature than he did: he knew its utility, as all must know it; but as to its influence upon their lordships' decisions, he would express his understanding of the constitution in a very few words&#x2014;he would give precisely the same attention to the measures recommended by the Commons as the Commons would give to those emanating from the Peers&#x2014;and no more. But the noble duke had changed his intentions with a view to conciliation. He (lord F.) hoped that, on such occasions, all the spirit of conciliation was not to be evinced towards the noble duke's constant opponents, and that some small portion of it would be thought due to those who had been his firm political friends&#x2014;who had upheld those principles which the noble duke had professed to uphold, and who would still uphold them under all changes and all circumstances. In this feeling he trusted that the bill was open to great alteration, since to the principle of substituting such a Declaration for the Sacramental Test, he never could assent, considering it, as he did, to be positively good for nothing at all: even the words "in the presence of Almighty God," after "I, A. B. do solemnly declare," appeared to have been studiously avoided, as if to discard all such solemnity. He declared, too, that he had never heard the shadow of a
<col>1582</col>
reason why the security of an oath should not be taken upon this, as upon other occasions. It had been said by a right rev. prelate, with whose excellence of character he was not unacquainted, and who, by his able defence of the connexion between the Church and State, on other questions, had attained the eminence from, which he was the better able to dispense around him the benefits of a bright example&#x2014;by him it had been said, that, "no honest man could make this Declaration, coupling it with the preamble of the bill, and not feel bound by it." But in judging by his own high principles, that right rev. prelate (the bishop of Durham) had forgotten that they did not legislate for honest men: they did not make laws for men's honesty and virtues; it was against the obliquities of human nature that they had to provide; and in this point of view, how could such a Declaration for a moment be thought effectual? Again, it was said that Deists and Atheists were not to be bound by any oaths or declarations; but there was another tribunal, of which, even an Atheist, if there existed so wretched a being, must live in awe&#x2014;that of public opinion&#x2014;even an Atheist would quake before the scourge of public opinion; and in proportion as the Test should be made sacred and solemn, would Christians take care that it should not be broken, with impunity. He knew that he might render himself liable to the charge of being an ultra Tory, by advocating old-fashioned, and as they might be called, obsolete principles. This was a very foolish term, by the bye, to apply to any party in. this country; but if he interpreted it rightly, the increase of kingly power and prerogative came within its meaning. Now, he was going to shew, that in this sense at least, he was, no ultra Tory; for he should strenuously object to the clauses at the end of the bill, giving to the Crown the power of dispensing with any Test upon admission to offices or places, and he entirely agreed with the learned lord, that those clauses ought to be expunged. He would no more consent to increase the privileges and power of the Crown, than he would take away one jot from the securities of the constitution, or liberties of the people. To him, therefore, this bill, as it now stood, was in the highest degree objectionable. He thought the principle of substituting so absolutely worthless a Declaration for the Sacramental Test, in-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0799"/>
<col>1583</col>
expedient and dangerous; and that to give an arbitrary power of dispensing with all Tests, to the Crown, would be unwise and unconstitutional: for which reasons, unless greatly altered, in the way he had pointed out, he should decidedly oppose the bill. He would only add, that however uselessly he might have addressed their lordships upon so important a subject, he could assure them, that he had expressed himself with sincerity, and without the slightest tinge of party feeling.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01428"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> said, he rose merely to state to their lordships, that the noble lord who had just sat down did not appear perfectly to understand the ground on which he had recommended this measure. Now, he had not gone the length which the noble lord had attributed to him. He had not called on their lordships to agree to this bill, because it had been passed in the House of Commons. He had merely assigned that as one of the reasons that had induced him to recommend the measure to their lordships. He certainly had alluded to the feeling in favour of the bill, which had for some time been growing up in the House of Commons, as a good reason for entertaining it in their lordships' house; but other reasons also operated on his mind. Many individuals of high eminence in the Church, and who were as much interested as any persons in the kingdom in the preservation of the constitution, had expressed themselves as being favourable to an alteration of the law. The religious feelings of those venerable persons disposed them to entertain this measure, because they felt strong objections to the Sacramental Test. Under these circumstances, wishing to advance and to preserve the blessings of religious peace and tranquillity&#x2014;conceiving the present to be a good opportunity for securing to the country so inestimable an advantage&#x2014;he had felt it to be his duty to recommend the measure to their lordships. It was on all these grounds that he supported the bill, and not on the single ground of its having been carried in the House of Commons. He was not one of those who considered that the best means of preserving the constitution of the country was by adhering to measures, which had been called for by particular circumstances, because they had been in existence for two hundred years, since the lapse of time might render it proper to modify, if not to remove them
<col>1584</col>
altogether. The noble lord stated that he had objections to this bill. If the noble lord suffered the bill to go into a committee, and would there state his propositions, every attention would be paid to them. All he hoped was, that their lordships would not unnecessarily make any alterations in the measure that were likely to give dissatisfaction; that they would not do any thing which might be calculated to disturb that conciliatory spirit which was now growing up&#x2014;a spirit that, would redound to the benefit of the country, and which, so far from opposing, they ought, on the contrary, to do every thing to foster and promote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01429"><member>The Earl of Harewood</member><membercontribution> said, he considered a bill of this, nature, a measure which was so interesting to a large portion of the population, called for deliberate consideration, and ought not to be hastily passed. It appeared extraordinary to him, after the long silence which had prevailed on this subject, that it should be thus suddenly brought before Parliament; and, looking to this circumstance, it seemed as if the government had been taken by surprise. Would any man believe, that after thirty-five or forty years perfect quiescence under these laws, that persons calling themselves Dissenters, without any thing having been done to increase the pressure of those enactments, should suddenly feel the pressure to be so grievous that they could no longer bear it? Was this measure brought forward solely on account of the general feeling of the Dissenters? Because if it were not, he must look for the cause elsewhere. He might be wrong; but he must conceive that cause to be closely connected with another measure, which involved political considerations of great importance. He believed that it was with reference to that measure, that this question was brought forward at present. The question, however, for their lordships' consideration was, whether the present was a satisfactory measure. It was brought from the other House of Parliament&#x2014;that House having, by this bill, admitted that some Declaration was necessary. Now, it appeared to him to be very curious, that in the Declaration contained in the bill, no notice was taken of this important question; namely, whether a man to whom the Declaration was about to be administered was or was not a Christian? He should be sorry to exclude the Dissenters from those privi-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0800"/>
<col>1585</col>
leges which they enjoyed under the Indemnity bill; but when they came to that House with a new Declaration, their lordships ought to see that it was a proper one. When he looked to the Declaration, it appeared to him to" be deficient. In forming a Declaration suitable to such a bill, it ought to proceed on this simple; proposition &#x2014; that the man taking it, thereby declared himself to be a believer in Christianity. The answer to this, he knew was, that it was useless to provide such a Test, for persons who did not believe would take any oath that might be propounded to them. But, notwithstanding that, he did not wish to see a Declation that did not contain some provision of this nature standing on the records of parliament. He wished merely that a: clause should be inserted in the Declaration, from which it would appear, that; every man who took it, believed in the Christian religion. It was not because he&#x0021; expected any great security from the Declaration that he was desirous of having it &#x0021; thus altered; but he wished it so to be worded for the credit of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01430"><member>The Bishop of Llandaff</member><membercontribution> said, he was of opinion that a Test could easily be formed, which would provide for the perfect security of the Church of England, and be satisfactory to the other party. As to the Church of Scotland, it was, he conceived, perfectly safe as the bill at present stood, Additions had been suggested to the Declaration, but they did not immediately meet his ideas on the subject; and he meant, at the proper time, to propose such alterations as appeared to him more likely to effect the object which every Declaration must have in view. The phrase, "the wisdom of our ancestors," had, he thought, on a former night, been taken up and animadverted on very inconsiderately. He hoped that this arose from the heat and fervour of the moment. It. had been said on that occasion, that the measures which they were now called on to repeal, had been framed and carried in a spirit of violence and faction; but he would maintain, on the contrary, that they were the result of policy and reason, and were rendered necessary by the circumstances of the time. Great dangers at that period threatened the interests both of the State and of the Church. It was right that those dangers should be resisted; but it was equally proper, at the present, moment, when no hostility towards the Church was
<col>1586</col>
manifested, that the measures which were formerly necessary should be relaxed. Grave and serious attention ought to be bestowed on this measure, before it was allowed to be passed into a law. He spoke more especially with reference to the Declaration; but he mentioned this point without meaning to create any discussion on it at present. It would, however, in his opinion, be more satisfactory if the words of the Declaration were framed in a style of phrase as nearly similar to an oath as possible. The effect of the Declaration was to invest certain persons with civil offices, who, unless they took that Declaration, would be considered unfit for them. Therefore, they ought, in drawing up the Declaration, to take care to provide for the inviolability of that union of Church and State which at present existed; and therefore he thought it would be proper to call on those taking the Test to declare, on the faith of Christians, that they would not endeavour, by the exercise of any power with which their respective offices might invest them, to interfere with the rights and immunities of the Church of England. With such a modification, he should approve of the bill; and, indeed, he conceived that it was essential to its safety.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01431"><member>The Earl of Haddington</member><membercontribution> was anxious that the inviolability of the Church of Scotland should be strictly preserved. The learned lord (Eldon) had stated, that the safety of the constitution of Great Britain was intimately connected with the safety of the Church of England. He admitted this position in its fullest extent. He felt that the Church of England was an essential part of the constitution of England; but he must be allowed to say, that the Church of Scotland was as much so. Both churches formed a part of the constitution. Such, then, being the case, he presumed that, to have omitted the Church of Scotland in this measure, would have been wrong; because it would appear as if, in point of fact, when the inviolability of only one Church was noticed, the inviolability of the other was not recognized. The Church of Scotland, however, needed no Test; and, with respect to that point, he would never consent that any Test should be imposed with reference to it. Beyond that, he would state his firm belief to be, that the Church of England needed Tests just as little. His opinion of the Church of England was such as induced,
<image src="S2V0018P0I0801"/>
<col>1587</col>
him to think that she could as safely exist without Tests as the Church of Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01432"><member>Lord Colchester.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I have ever been of; opinion, that the stability of all Governments was best ensured by vesting the political powers of the State in those of its subjects who conform to its Established Religion. In that spirit the Laws were made which it is now proposed to repeal; and they are allowed on all hands to have been necessary in their own day. But, under the nominal existence of these laws, controlled as they have been, or rather suspended, for the last four-score years by the annual Indemnity Act, the Security originally intended has been practically annulled; and nothing has remained but the Inconvenience, greatly exaggerated, and over-rated, as I think&#x2014;the inconvenience of placing the Clergy often in the situation of being called upon to administer the Holy Sacrament under unsuitable circumstances, and inducing the Dissenters also to take offices under the expected protection of the Indemnity Act, to which offices they were, at the same time, by the permanent Laws of the Country, inadmissible.<lb/>
These inconveniencies, the original advantage having long since ceased, I am not unwilling to concur in removing; and I shall therefore join in the vote of this night for going into the Committee upon this Bill,&#x2014;with an earnest desire, nevertheless, to render the Declaration which it is proposed to substitute as an Equivalent for the Sacramental Test, more binding in its form, by assuming the character of an Oath, and more specific in its description of the profession of religious faith of the person who takes it, by requiring that he shall declare himself to be a Protestant.<lb/>
Another most important amendment will be required in that proposed enactment, which gives to the King's Council the absolute powers of prescribing the class of persons from whom the Declaration shall be required&#x2014;the time when,&#x2014; and in truth, whether it shall ever, at any time, be required in any case whatever. Such an abdication by Parliament of its own legislative duties, and such a transfer of its own proper powers to the Sovereign, has been unknown to our Statute Book since the days of Henry the Eighth; and the whole of that portion of the present Bill must be remodelled, and whatever exceptions it maybe fit to make for confining
<col>1588</col>
this new Test to the higher and more efficient offices, and exempting the inferior classes of the civil and military services, all such limitations should be expressly defined by the hand of Parliament itself. In order to render the Bill more fit for its professed ends in these important provisions,&#x2014;I shall, therefore, concur in the present motion; reserving my vote on the final adoption or rejection of the entire Bill, according to the altered form in which it may hereafter come before the House upon the Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01433"><member>Lord Redesdale</member><membercontribution> said, he should oppose the bill; and his great reason for doing so was, that the constitution compelled the king to be a member of the Church of England. He was compelled to take an oath, in which he swore to support the Church of England and Ireland, as by law established; and yet they were, by this bill, about to provide, that every one of his ministers might be of a different Church [hear]. The king was compelled to be of the Church of England, but all his confidential advisers might profess another faith. This was his great objection, and he did not know how it could be removed.<lb/>
The House then went into a committee on the bill. When the clause enacting the repeal of certain parts of the 13th and 25th of Charles 2nd, and certain parts of the act of the 16th of George 2nd was read,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01434"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member> moved an amendment, exempting from the necessity of taking the Declaration such members of the Church of England, and such Dissenters, as had taken the Sacramental Test six months before coming into office: such a ceremonial having in fact, qualified them, they ought not to be considered liable to another Test. He could see no reason why individuals who were willing to take the Sacramental Test should be required to take the Declaration. Such persons, being members of the Church of England, or Dissenters who did not scruple to take the Sacramental Test, ought to be allowed to qualify under the acts now in force, if they pleased. It should be left to their opinion.</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01435"><member>Lord Ellenborough</member><membercontribution> said, that of the two amendments the first was wholly unnecessary; the second extremely mischievous. There would be no hardship in proposing the intended Declaration to persons already qualified for office under the
<image src="S2V0018P0I0802"/>
<col>1589</col>
existing law; and they certainly could have no possible objection to the taking of it. The second amendment, however, would be extremely mischievous. The object of ministers, and of parliament, was to preserve the religious peace of the country, and to do away with those apparent differences which divided the several religious persuasions in this country. It was the desire of ministers to have such distinctions abolished; and he trusted that they would be seconded in their efforts by that House. There should be no distinction in civil offices between Dissenters and Church of England men. Both should be equally admitted to office on declaring their determination to support the constitution faithfully and loyally. He would entreat their lordships not to mar the object of parliament in the proposed measure, and not to increase the religious distinctions and differences in the country. He trusted they would put the Dissenters and the members of the Church of England upon the same footing, and that the same qualification for office would be required from both.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01436"><member>The Earl of Harrowby</member><membercontribution> agreed in considering the first amendment superfluous, and the second extremely mischievous. The learned lord had said, that it would be a hardship to require from persons who had already taken the Sacramental Test, a new Declaration in the shape of another Test. But that Test merely consisted of a Declaration, to which those who had already taken the Sacramental Test could have no possible objection. The other amendment would be most mischievous, as it was calculated to maintain those invidious distinctions which it was the object of the bill to remove.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01437"><member>The Bishop of Chester</member><membercontribution> sincerely hoped that the amendments would not be agreed to. To those amendments he was strongly opposed; and he was surprised that some consideration for his consistency did not operate to prevent the learned lord from proposing them. The noble lord had formerly declared, that he supported the Sacramental Test as the means of keeping the Dissenters out of office. Now, however, he stated that many Dissenters took the Test as a qualification for office, and he; proposed to except such Dissenters from the Declaration contained in the bill. The noble lord would be content with the taking of the Sacrament as a proof of the sincerity of a Church of England man,
<col>1590</col>
and he would include in his exception the Dissenter, who merely took that Sacrament as the means of qualifying for office, and not as an expression of his conformity to the Communion of the Church of England. Now the principle of the present bill&#x2014;a principle to which he should give his decided support, was to prevent the mingling of the sacred and solemn rite of the Sacrament with the qualification for civic, and other worldly employments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01438"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> would recommend the right rev. prelate to attend to his own consistency rather than to be talking about that of others. He had at least been as consistent as the right rev. prelate on this subject, and he would be so to the end. He did not know whether the present bill applied to ecclesiastical corporations; indeed, he believed the framers of it were themselves ignorant whether it went to that extent. If it did apply to ecclesiastical corporations, the right rev. prelate opposite, in being promoted, as it was very likely he would be in the course of time, to a certain high and permanent station in the church, would be obliged to take the Declaration prescribed by this bill before he could be admitted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01439"><member>The Bishop of Chester</member><membercontribution> did not consider it fair in the noble lord to put an hypothesis which was not a fact, and to argue upon a case which could not happen under the existing laws. He would advise the noble lord to found his reasonings upon something more tangible and more to the purpose. Such a course would be more consistent with the discharge of his duty, and more likely, perhaps, to attain his object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01440"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> begged the reverend prelate would abstain from thus gratuitously tendering his advice. He had advised him (lord Eldon) to mind his duty, but he should not offend the rev. prelate by advising him as to the mode in which he should discharge his duty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01441"><member>The Bishop of Litchfield</member><membercontribution> said, the noble earl would except from the proposed Declaration all such members of the Church of England, as well as Dissenters, who had taken the Sacrament according to the rites of the Established Church. But many members of the Church of England might have taken the Sacrament in the discharge of their religious duties, whereas, to qualify for office, it must be taken for that especial purpose, and before certain magisterial functionaries. There-
<image src="S2V0018P0I0803"/>
<col>1591</col>
fore, many of the persons whom the noble earl would except by his amendment, would not actually, under the existing law, have qualified themselves for office. He was opposed to the amendment. The amendment was then put and negatived. On the question being put, upon the first clause,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01442"><member>Lord Redesdale </member><membercontribution>objected to it. He did not think the security which it proposed at all sufficient. Indeed, it was perfectly ridiculous. From experience he would say, that the Declaration would be entirely nugatory and of no avail. The Chairman said, they had not as yet come to the second clause, which contained the Declaration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01443"><member>Lord Redesdale</member><membercontribution> said, that his objection to that clause was applicable to the whole bill. By the act of settlement, they bound the prince upon the throne by oath to maintain the Protestant establishment; and by this bill they would leave every officer under the sovereign free to profess what religion he pleased. Could there be a greater absurdity in legislation?<lb/>
The question was then put upon the first clause, and carried. The second clause having been read,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01444"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> proposed as an amendment, that after the words in the Declaration, &#x2014;" I, A. B., do solemnly," the following be introduced, "and sincerely, in the presence of Almighty God, profess, testify, and"&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01445"><member>The Bishop of Llandaff</member><membercontribution> proposed, as an additional amendment, that after the word "and," and before the word "declare" there be introduced the words "upon the faith of a Christian." The principle of the measure was to admit persons to office who dissented from the communion of the Church of England. Now, he did not conceive it sufficient to require from such persons, when entering upon office, to declare that they would use none of the influence of which they might become possessed, in virtue of that office, to injure, weaken, or subvert the established church. He conceived that they should be further required, as every magistrate was called upon on entering upon office, to promise to discharge the duties of it, to maintain and uphold the rights and privileges of the Established Church whenever in danger. He should therefore propose, as a further amendment, that after the word "entitle," at the end of the Declaration, the subscriber be further palled upon to say, under the
<col>1592</col>
solemn sanction already imparted to the Declaration&#x2014;" and that I will so far as concerns the duties of the said office, respect and maintain the rights and privileges of the Established Church of these realms."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01446"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> proposed, that the word "swear" be substituted for the word "declare," and that the subscriber to the Declaration be further required to state that he was a Christian, and that he believed that the Scriptures, as received by the Protestant Churches, contained the revealed word of God. Those who took the Oath of Abjuration were obliged to profess themselves Christians; but this bill required no such profession. He should like to know what those rights and privileges were. If the subscriber were required, not merely to maintain the rights and privileges of the Established Church, but the rights and privileges of the bishops and clergy of that Church, then he could understand what was meant. But the phrase, as it at present stood, was perfectly unintelligible to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01447"><member>Lord Tenterden</member><membercontribution> said, the amendment proposed by the noble duke should be considered separately from the other amendments, and decided upon its own merits. As that amendment was calculated to give greater solemnity to the Declaration, he was prepared to vote for it. As for the Declaration itself, it required much amendment.<lb/>
The amendment proposed by the duke of Wellington was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01448"><member>The Bishop of Llandaff</member><membercontribution> then proposed, that after the word "declare," the words "upon the true faith of a Christian," be introduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01449"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> claimed precedence in point of order for his amendment. He moved, that the word "swear" be substituted for "declare."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01450"><member>Lord Ellenborough</member><membercontribution> wished to call the attention of their lordships to the nature of the amendments now proposed. They required the candidate for office, first, to declare that he spoke on the faith of a Christian, and then, having drawn from him a declaration of so solemn a nature, they next required him to declare that not only he would not use his office to injure the interests of the church of England, but would use it to maintain and support those interests. In fact, they proposed a declaration, the object of which was to oblige the Dissenter, who, conscientiously
<image src="S2V0018P0I0804"/>
<col>1593</col>
differed from the doctrines of the Established Church to maintain those doctrines, and to support the establishment, so far as he was enabled to do so by the powers 'of his office. He urged their lordships to consider the practical evils of these amendments. The practical evils were, that for I seventy or eighty years, Dissenters had been admitted to office without being required to declare that they would contribute to the support or security of the Church. At the end of that period, the loyalty of the Dissenters was considered to have been so amply proved, that they were thought worthy of being relieved altogether from the Tests and disabilities imposed upon them, not merely by the operation of an Annual Bill of Indemnity, but by an act. repealing those Tests which they had for a long time felt so grievous in their operation. The object of the present bill was, therefore, to relieve them from that control, and from those difficulties, which were not more dangerous to their interests than degrading to their character. It was proposed in the spirit of conciliation, and brought forward with the desire of showing the loyal Dissenters of England, that parliament deemed them deserving of a fair measure of grace, favour, and reasonable confidence. In that spirit he would vote for the bill and the Declaration as they now stood. He in treated their lordships not to be led, step by step, by amendments which appeared at first, view plausible, to convert a measure of grace, favour, and conciliation, into one of jealousy and suspicion. The Declarations now proposed were at best useless: he thought they were likely to be injurious. It was impossible to object, to the terms of the amendments; but though they could offend no churchman, they might be as objectionable to the Dissenters as those which it was now proposed to repeal; and if so, they ought not to be adopted, as they would go to defeat altogether the spirit and object of the bill. If that was not their character, then he objected to them as unnecessary, and not only unnecessary, but injurious, as they shewed a degree of suspicion not warranted by the conduct of the Dissenters. The objection as to the amendments being unnecessary, peculiarly applied to the proposition for the candidate for office declaring his belief in Christianity. The act of the 9th and 10th of William and Mary already provided against any danger which
<col>1594</col>
could arise from persons not professing the Christian religion obtaining possession of office. Under that act any person who, by writing or otherwise expressed his disbelief in the Christian religion, or in the authority of the sacred scriptures, might be deprived of his office. Therefore, any additional precaution on that head was unnecessary. He disliked the alterations now proposed, as they went to change the healing character of the measure; and he therefore trusted they would be rejected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01451"><member>The Earl of Malmesbury</member><membercontribution> said, he was decidedly opposed to the continuance of the Sacramental Test, and expected to have found the bill repealing that act entitled to his unqualified support. He did, however, trust that something would be substituted for what was taken away. He had a sincere respect for the body of Protestant Dissenters, and would advocate; the removal of all disabilities from them; but there were some who called themselves Dissenters (he alluded to the Unitarians), in reference to whom the term was certainly a misnomer. They were not Dissenters; they were not Christians. He was willing to admit the Dissenters&#x2014;as well those who had been called in that House "the miserable Wesleyans," as those denominated Presbyterians; but those who were not Christians he certainly would exclude.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01452"><member>Lord Tenterden</member><membercontribution> wished to call the attention of their lordships to that part of the bill which preceded this clause. Their lordships were not, perhaps, aware of the material difference between the Corporation and Test acts. He was of opinion, that sufficient consideration had not been paid to the distinction between the qualification for Corporation and other offices. He would suggest the expediency of considering whether there ought not to be a material difference between the two acts in the measure before the committee. The Corporation act required persons accepting office to take the Sacrament, and the Test act was framed at the outset against Popish recusants. It appeared to him that, in repealing those two acts, proper substitutes were not recommended; seeing that they affected different interests, and were intended to apply to different classes. The Corporation act applied only to England, and not to Scotland; for that act was passed by the legislature of England, which, at the time, had no power to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0805"/>
<col>1595</col>
bind Scotland. It was different, however, as to the Test-act; for that was national, and applied to this side of the Tweed as well as the other. These distinctions, he submitted had not been sufficiently adverted to. He should vote for the amendment; and he was induced to do so with the hope that, before the bill finally received the sanction of the House, it would be provided, that offices in Corporations should be filled by members of the Church of England; but he did not wish to restrict the Test act to the same narrow limits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01453"><member>The Earl of Harrowby</member><membercontribution> said, he thought that the distinction between the principle and object of the two acts could be better discussed in a future stage of the committee, than upon the present clause. He, for one, could certainly not conceive what danger could arise to the State from leaving the bill with the original Declaration; nor could he apprehend the additional value of the proposed substitute to counteract such a danger, if any should happen to arise. He differed entirely from his noble and learned friend with respect to the danger of the whole measure, and he was fortified in this opinion by the conduct of the legislature, not at any one particular period under a sudden exigency, but during an uninterrupted series of years, when they had uniformly interposed to suspend these acts, and thereby manifested their indisposition to believe that any danger arose to the Church from the admission into office of a large proportion of the Dissenters. A right rev. prelate had re-stated what he believed to be an historical mistake, respecting the origin of these statutes; namely, that they were originally intended to exclude from civil office all who were not <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> members of the Church of England. This was certainly not the fact; for in the parliament immediately after the Restoration, when the House of Commons ordered all its members to take the Sacrament, two only out of fifty-four Dissenters then in parliament objected to take it according to the forms of the Church of England. With this fact before their eyes, the parliament which passed the Corporation act only a few months afterwards, could not have done so with the intention or the hope of excluding all Dissenters. It was only between the years 1711 and 1718, during the existence of the act against Occasional Conformity, that the intention of the legisla-
<col>1596</col>
ture appeared to be to confirm official and corporate situations to <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> members of the Church of England. Previously to that act, and after its repeal, the only object either of the Corporation act or of the Test act was to exclude such Dissenters as was so hostile to the Church, as to conceive it as a sin to partake of its rites.<lb/>
Be that, however, as it might, they had both, as he thought, lain dormant for near a century; and his first impression, on hearing that the repeal was to be proposed, was unfavourable to the measure. It had been so on the ground that religious peace had, in point of fact, been preserved under those acts, and that no practical grievance existed. It had appeared, however, in the course of the debates, that practical grievances did exist, in spite of the Annual Indemnity acts, and were felt, as well they might, not only by Dissenters but by members of the Church of England. The extension of these grievances, and the expediency of removing them, having been acknowledged by the other House, it was clear that their continuance would be adverse to religious peace. The measure also was no longer the same. A Declaration was substituted for the Sacramental Test, and upon this ground he rejoiced that the government had wisely decided, not only to withdraw all opposition, but to modify and support the bill. He should have felt no apprehension, if the bill had passed in its original shape, as he thought the best way of securing the continuance of peace and harmony would have been an unequivocal display of confidence and liberality on the part of those who were conferring the boon. He was however perfectly willing, and even desirous, to allay the apprehensions of others. He could not, on his own part, feel that alarm for the Church which was exhibited by those who professed themselves its warmest friends. He had a higher opinion of that Church than they appeared to entertain. With its pure and apostolical doctrines, its liturgy, the best of all uninspired writings, its system of discipline, susceptible as it was of amendment, and the general acquirements, zeal and good conduct of its clergy, it stood far too high in his estimation, to be in need of such ineffectual and odious support. If he had sometimes thought that the Church was too much inclined to rest upon secular supports, it was only with the greater pleasure
<image src="S2V0018P0I0806"/>
<col>1597</col>
that he had witnessed the conduct of the right reverend bench upon the present occasion. The Church now placed her strength upon the higher and nobler grounds of her own intrinsic merits, and rested her rejection of the Sacramental Test upon truly Christian motives&#x2014;upon the removal of a scandal and a profanation. Long might she pursue a course, by which both her dignity and her security were equally advanced. Let her throw away her crutches, and, with mien erect, pursue her own majestic march&#x2014; "<i>et vera incessu pateat Dea.</i>"<lb/>
Strongly as he felt these opinions, he was still ready to lean to the accommodation of the opinions of others, and not refuse any reasonable concession to soothe and allay individual differences. These Tests, it was true, had been miscalled bulwarks; but there were those who thought them so, and he neither wished to dismantle the fortress nor to dishearten the garrison; if therefore any reasonable substitute were agreed upon, which appeared to answer the same end as the old qualification, it should have his support; provided, however, that it did not fritter away the grace of this measure to the Dissenters, and prevent their accepting it with joy and delight, or make it a question among them, after what had passed, whether or not they had received a boon when this act should have been enacted for them. In looking at the original Test, and that proposed in its room, they ought to begin by comparing the relative value of the two stipulations. The Sacrament was one, and a Declaration the other. What was the force of the former? It went no further than this&#x2014;that the Dissenter did not consider the Church of England as so corrupt, that he could not communicate with it without sin. It did not even by inference imply that he preferred it to his own; and a member of a Corporation, who had qualified on a Sunday, in order to become so, might, without any breach of consistency or any violation of his conscience, move on Monday for an Address to parliament to abolish Episcopacy. This Test did not require that he should declare that he would do nothing to injure the Church of England. If, therefore, the Test and Corporation acts had been in constant operation, they afforded no security whatever. What were they, then, when they had slumbered for a century, and must long ago have received their
<col>1598</col>
death-blow, if they had not been suffered to exist under the condition of perpetual sleep?<lb/>
The worst of this Declaration, on the contrary, seemed to him to be framed in such a manner that it was impossible for any man to escape from the main point to which they had reference. The expression was, that no influence derived from office should be used to the detriment of the Church of England, or of the rights of its bishops or clergy. The Sacramental Test did not, even by inference, go so far as this Declaration. He could not help thinking, that any thing beyond this was going into lengths that were superfluous, and therefore invidious: and, let it be observed, that this was a guard to the Church, beyond what was thought necessary for the security of any other essential institution in the country.<lb/>
The proposition, however, was, that an oath should be substituted for a Declaration. Far from being of opinion, that fresh oaths should be heaped upon the Statute-book, he wished rather to diminish their number. Why was an oath proposed? Because it was feared that the bond of a Declaration would be broken; and would not those who overlooked so solemn a Declaration be the very persons to break an oath? What necessity was there for evincing any desire to carry their apprehensions to that length, in defiance of the experience which they had of the value of conciliation and the diffusion of goodwill among all classes of Christians? In every view which he could take of the subject, he saw no necessity for the proposed amendment of the bill which had been sent up to their lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

However, if they were altogether to abandon the benefit of that security, they might as well be at once without the enactment of the various statutes which had fenced round the Established Church.

any member of the reverend bench. He thought he had sufficiently guarded himself against any such imputation. It ought not to be supposed, that in saying that the amendments proposed were so numerous and so various, that it appeared as if they were proposed with no other intention than to defeat the bill, that he was making any reflection on the reverend bench, as only one of the amendments proposed came from that quarter. He never meant to impute to the reverend bench that they had any wish to defeat this bill. He declared his solemn belief that they had no such intention. Such an intention would be opposed to the enlightened and liberal sentiments which had been expressed by many, and concurred in by all the members of that bench. All he had intended to do was to express his regret that the Church had, in some instances, depended too much upon the secular arm of the state, and too little upon the strength and veracity of its doctrines&#x2014;an observation which, he believed, had found an echo in the breast of every man who heard him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01456"><member>The Earl of Carnarvon</member><membercontribution> said, that though he was anxious to give the reverend bench every reasonable satisfaction, he could not refrain from reminding them, that if they would listen to every suspicion which ingenuity would discover for them, they would make this bill not a measure of peace, but of religious animosity and discord. The question which they were called upon to decide was, whether they should introduce an oath instead of a Declaration into the bill. Now, it appeared to him, that their lordships had already virtually decided that question by agreeing to that part of the clause, which called upon every person taking office to sign a Declaration. The bill was intended as a measure of religious peace; but it would not retain that character if it made it incumbent upon individuals to say, "I swear" instead of "I declare" so and so. He hardly knew whether a bill which had been introduced that session for the purpose of conferring relief, in certain cases, on Quakers, had passed or not; but if it had, it would be rendered nugatory by the substitution of the words "I swear," for "I declare;" for, as their religious tenets prevented them from swearing, those words would effectually exclude them from any office of trust and importance. Independently of this objection to substi-
<col>1600</col>
tuting an oath for a Declaration, there was great force in the argument which had been so well put by the noble earl opposite&#x2014;that in the various laws which the House had already made, it had gone much too far in the multiplication of useless and unnecessary oaths. Their lordships had made men so familiar with oaths, that they them without even listening to them, as they took were mumbled over by a clerk, who generally read them as if he was anxious that they should not be understood. The real question for consideration was simply this &#x2014;is not a solemn declaration, in the face of God, equivalent to an oath? He called upon their lordships to consider what was the security, if indeed it were one, which the legislature had provided against the Roman Catholics. It was the Declaration against transubstantiation: for there were many conscientious Catholics who would take the Oath of Abjuration, but who would not make the declaration against transubstantiation. If, then, that declaration was the principal security which deprived the Catholics of the rights and privileges enjoyed by their fellow-subjects, why should it now be deemed necessary to introduce into the bill a word which would exclude from the benefit of it one of the mildest and most beneficent sects in the empire? He should certainly vote against the introduction of the words "I swear."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01457"><member>The Bishop of Chester</member><membercontribution> expressed himself more favourable to inserting a Declation than an oath in this bill.

<p id="S2V0018P0-01458"><member>The Earl of Eldon</member><membercontribution> said, that as their lordships called on the king, in his coronation oath, to swear to maintain the Church, the bishops, and the clergy, in their due rights and privileges, it was only fitting that they should call upon all subjects who held office under him to take the same oath. He doubted whether this measure would be a measure of religious peace. The acts which it sought to repeal better deserved that appellation; for, on the one hand, they were confirmatory of the supremacy of the Church, and on the other they held out an indemnity to all Dissenters, in all cases where such indemnity could safely be afforded them. One objection to this bill was, that it gave a dispensing power to the Crown, and would leave it to his majesty to determine
<image src="S2V0018P0I0808"/>
<col>1601</col>
whether any of the persons who held offices of trust under him should take either Declaration or oath. He called upon their lordships, whatever might be the consequences, to do justice to the constitution in their conduct regarding this bill. He had heard it said with surprise and regret, that oaths had of late years been so multiplied by the legislature that they now went for nothing. He could not bring himself to believe that there was any foundation for such an assertion. He had a firm persuasion that, with some few exceptions, an oath had a mighty effect upon the consciences of Englishmen. After a long life spent in the administration of justice, he felt himself bound to say that nothing could be more dangerous to the morality of the community than to hear noble lords in their places in parliament publicly disparage the effect of an oath, by comparing it with that of a Declaration. He was of opinion, that as an oath was much more solemn in its nature, it ought, in this case, to be preferred to a Declaration. In his opposition to this bill, he was governed by nothing but a sense of duty; and, acting upon that sense of duty, he could not lend his assistance to depriving his fellow-subjects of the constitution which they had so long enjoyed. On these grounds he had met the bill with a decided negative; but as the House had decided that the bill should be read a second time, he was now desirous of making it as innocuous as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01459"><member>The Bishop of Bath and Wells</member><membercontribution> said, he had voted for the repeal of the Test and Corporation acts, in the expectation that it would promote peace and good understanding between the Church and the Dissenters. He trusted that the bill would be so framed as to render it a boon, for which the Dissenters might feel some gratitude. For that reason he would rather have a Declaration than an oath inserted in the bill: but he would add, after the words of the Declaration, the following words, "in the name of Jesus Christ." He thought that no offence could be taken at those words by any conscientious Dissenter. It would be shameful if any person who took office in a Christian country should be reluctant to declare publicly that he was a Christian.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01460"><member>The Marquis of Lansdowne</member><membercontribution> said, he was of opinion that it was almost impossible to look at this amendment, without looking <i>eodem intuitu</i> at the amendments and
<col>1602</col>
clauses which would shortly be submitted to their discussion. He must extend his view of the subject to the general character of the remedy which they were now providing, not so much to meet any actual danger, as to show to the country, that the spirit in which this act of relief was conceived, was one of mere relief to the Dissenter, without intending to take one jot from the security of the Church of England. In approaching this subject, he felt relieved in reflecting that he was not, in the present stage of the proceeding, called upon to argue whether it was fitting to retain upon the Statute-book acts which their lordships annually recognized, but which they were called upon to recognize only to avert the mischief, which, if not corrected, they would of necessity produce,&#x2014;acts which they had never noticed for a hundred years, except to arrest and nullify, not to further and protect the operation of their enactments. He felt relieved, he said, in reflecting that he was not called upon to contend that the holiest rite of our religion was not the most fitting key to open the door to civil employment. He was happy to find that it appeared to be the general opinion of their lordships to do away with securities so unnecessary and so useless as were those provided in the acts which this bill intended to repeal; and he would therefore take that opportunity of stating, that so far from its being a sudden thought to bring on a discussion on these acts to answer the purposes of a certain party in Church and State, it had for years past been an object for which the Dissenters had been preparing, and for which their preparations had produced a just and beneficial effect. After several observations on the beneficial consequences of the repeal of the Test act in Ireland, the noble marquis proceeded as follows:&#x2014;"I must here protest, my lords, against what I can never hear without pain and surprise; namely, that these acts of exclusion are parts of the constitution. I am one of those who can never subscribe to any such doctrine. King, Lords, and Commons, are, I admit, parts of the constitution, and so is the Church, as long as it meets with their approbation and support. But are the means which we devise for the support of the constitution part of the constitution itself? They may be necessary or they may be not&#x2014;they may be rejected or they may be not&#x2014;they vary according to times
<image src="S2V0018P0I0809"/>
<col>1603</col>
and circumstances, according to the feelings, the prejudices, and I will even add, the principles of men. But there is one principle of the constitution which never varies; there is one principle, which I may call its fundamental and pervading principle, and that is, that every subject of the realm is admissible to every office within it. The noble and learned lord, and those with whom he has acted, have, in the course of their public career, been guilty&#x2014;perhaps necessarily guilty &#x2014; of several innovations upon the constitution, because they deemed them expedient to its safety. They introduced the Convention bill; they supported the suspension of the habeas corpus; and perhaps they did both, not without reason. Now, I will venture to say, that if unfortunately it had been necessary to continue those measures to the present time, the noble and learned lord would be the last man in the country to say, that because they were necessary to secure the constitution, they therefore formed part of the constitution. I must also inform your lordships, that I cannot go the length of the reverend prelate, who addressed us early in the evening, that in adopting this bill we are admitting a new principle into the constitution. The principle of the constitution is, that every subject is admissible to office. That principle may, I allow, be legitimately suspended; but when we remove the suspension, we revert to the fundamental principle of the Constitution, that all who tender allegiance to the state are admissible to offices of trust and authority. The noble and learned lord likewise tells you, that you are compelled to substitute for this Test of the Sacrament, an oath, or something that shall be equivalent to it, because you have a right to demand that from the subject which, by a solemn compact, you demand from the king. Now, I say, that it is exactly because you impose upon the king an oath to maintain the Church, its rights and privileges, that you are left at liberty to dispense with it as far as regards others. The king is the head of the Church, and must therefore be in strict communion with it. In that very circumstance, you find a security for the Church only inferior to that which you derive from the opinion in which it is held, and which, I trust, you will always find its best safeguard against assault and injury&#x2014;a security far superior to any which it may derive from oaths, or declarations, or tests, or any thing which
<col>1604</col>
any legislature can devise for its defence. Oaths, when most efficacious, are but frail and artificial props to ecclesiastical establishments. Their most impregnable Support is the estimation and reverence in which they are held by the great mass of the people. I am happy to say that the Church of England flourishes in the opinion and the reverence of the people; and that that reverence, and that that opinion will be increased by the conduct which the bishops of the Church have pursued on this occasion, and which appears as a pledge of peace on their part to every sect of dissenting Christians."&#x2014;The noble marquis proceeded to observe, that he was most anxious to adopt the clause in such a form as would best reconcile it to the Church of England and to the Dissenters at large. He confessed that the amendment of the noble duke, in its present form, presented the fairest pledge of its character. He did not see any reason for adding to the Declaration the words&#x2014;" in the name of Jesus Christ." He considered the simplicity of the Declaration to be much in its favour, and he could not conceive of what stuff that man's conscience could be made, who could find a distinction between taking an oath to support the Church, and a solemn Declaration in the face of God not to assail it. If there were any such men, against them acts of parliament would be of no force. They could only be put down by the indignation which would burst upon them, whenever their acts exposed the laxity of their principles. It would be vain to expect to catch such miscreants within the nets of ordinary legislation: they would break through them without difficulty, and would only laugh at our efforts to embarrass and annoy them. For these reasons he preferred the Declaration, because it had all the security of an oath, without causing that mischievous multiplication of oaths against which it was incumbent that the legislature should guard. In conclusion, he stated his Conviction that unless this bill passed, it would be made, year after year, a ground of disturbing the religious peace and harmony of the community.<lb/>

You are entering into details of faith, when you call upon them to declare what part of the Old and New Testament they believe in. Can you say, that there are no controverted books, no apocryphal writings, on which different sects do not entertain different opinions? Whilst you express your desire to throw open the doors of office to all classes of Dissenters, why do you close them again by calling upon them to make a Declaration of their belief in all parts of the Old and New Testament,
<col>1606</col>
which you have made canonical by authority? By such Declaration, we plunge at once into an endless labyrinth, and we substitute for an antique law, which scarcely embarrasses any one, a new clause, of which no one can define the meaning.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01468"><member>Lord Calthorpe</member><membercontribution> said, he approved of the Declaration. If they added any oaths, they would not add to the security of the Church, and would defeat their purpose. The Church did not need any such protection: its security was founded on the purity of its doctrines and the strictness of its faith. To impose these difficulties discovered something like a case of weakness. So far from upholding the character and dignity of the Church of England, they had a direct tendency to injure the one and degrade the other. Although at the present period, in consequence of the impulse given to knowledge, that occurred which had always occurred while knowledge was in its infancy; namely, the existence of a disposition to shake off ancient religious restraints, and to lean to infidel opinions, he was nevertheless persuaded, that that disposition was confined to a certain class of persons, and that at no time, since the Reformation, did the Church of England stand in higher estimation than at the present moment. Never were its functionaries more distinguished by their attention to their duties; and when the nature of the annual supply which the Church received from the universities was considered, there was every apparent security for her rising higher and higher in the public esteem. Under these circumstances, and feeling that the Church required no such protection, he should lament the transformation of the civil Declaration which the bill contained into a religious Test. The supremacy of the Church of England was conferred on her by law. The means, therefore, by which that supremacy was supported ought to be civil. It was exceedingly desirable to put an end to the Test and Corporation acts, not only to rescue our fellow-subjects from the obloquy cast upon them, but as a warning against future legislation in the same spirit. Although he did ample justice to the motives of those who proposed the various changes in the Declaration, he begged to remind them, that if they thus went on, step by step, altering its nature, they would undo with one hand what they had done with the other. It was a most memorable circumstance attending this
<image src="S2V0018P0I0811"/>
<col>1607</col>
bill, that, in that House of Parliament in which the Dissenters possessed a considerable influence, it was not passed until after a division, and by no very large majority; but that in their lordships' House, in which not only no such influence existed, but in which the presence of the heads of the Church, and many other circumstances concurred to strengthen its interests, the bill was received with great cordiality. He hoped the Declaration and every part of the bill would be so modified, as to give relief to the Dissenters and confer benefit on the Church.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01469"><member>Lord Redesdale</member><membercontribution> said, he would ask their lordships, what was the simple law on this subject as it now stood? Why, it merely supposed that those persons who took offices were members of the Established Church; and, therefore, instead of interrogating them individually&#x2014;"Are you a member of the Church of England?" it said, "Do you conform to the ceremonies of that Church? because if you do, I will not inquire more particularly." This was the simple law as it now stood; and the Declaration would only introduce doubt and difficulty where none existed now. If they would simply repeal the present law, matters would stand precisely as they did before the passing of that law. The Church of England stood before the passing of the Test and Corporation acts, and it stood now. To introduce a clause like this would lead to endless disputes. Many men would declare what they would not swear to; and some did not think an oath binding, if it was not proposed in their own way. He could see no end of the difficulties to which this clause would lead, If they would say, that it was no longer necessary that persons taking office should show that they were members of the Established Church by adhering to its ceremonies, let them repeal the law altogether, and not add complicated difficulties by such an alteration as that now proposed. And, after all, what did it do? It allowed a man to exercise every other influence in the world but that which he derived from his office. It admitted to office any person, whatever his religious opinions might be, if he would promise not to make his office the means of subverting the church. The first Church in this country was the Church of Rome; but at one time they had a king upon the throne who had the House of Lords at. his command. He, was a sort of absolute king, who by
<col>1608</col>
the influence of his political power threw off the supremacy of the Pope, and so they went on until the Church of England was Established. Political influence, therefore, their lordships would see, created what was called the Established Church.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01470"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member><membercontribution> observed, that he had introduced his amendment with a hope that it might tend to the production of unanimity. Having, however, become aware that the words of it were objectionable, as they might have the effect which he never intended, of excluding Roman Catholics from being officers of the army and navy, he should propose a more comprehensive form of expression.<lb/>
A desultory conversation here took place, with respect to the form of putting the amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01471"><member>Earl Grey</member><membercontribution> said, that as to the words which it was the intention of the noble duke to insert, he did not wish them to form a part of the bill. For his own part, he should have been more content with a simple repeal of the existing laws, without any Declaration at all. He should prefer that the Church of England should stand, as assuredly it would stand, upon that rock which was formed by the purity of its doctrines and the superior character of its professors. These would form security enough, without the aid of Test and Corporation acts. On these the Church of Ireland had rested in safety, without any such assistance as these acts were supposed to afford; or if it was exposed to any danger it was owing to those severe and intolerant laws which made the majority of the people of Ireland the enemies of the church establishment. If, then, he should have preferred the simple repeal of the existing laws, so also he should prefer the simple Declaration as it originally stood, to the amendments which had been proposed in it. To the first words introduced by the noble duke he had no objection; but he was afraid that by their endeavours to conciliate, they frequently got into difficulties. The ground which the noble duke had taken on this question entitled him to the thanks of the country, and increased the confidence which he had in the noble duke's administration. If some further proof of the candidate for office being a Christian were necessary, it would be better, perhaps, to add, as a reverend prelate had proposed, the words ",on the true faith of a Christian," or words to that effect. As far, however, as unanimity was

So long as we had an Established Church, so long ought every thing to be done to give effect and dignity to it.

<title>CORPORATION OF LUDLOW.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01479"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, he had a petition to present from Ludlow, complaining that the Corporation of that borough had devoted the funds, which ought to have been appropriated to the improvement of the town, to the payment of the expenses which the corporation had incurred in legal proceedings. No doubt this was highly improper conduct, and ought to be inquired into. But the petitioners also prayed, that the House would inquire into certain proceedings in the House of Lords, offering to prove at the bar of the; House that, in a cause in which the petitioners and the corporation had been concerned, and which came before the House of Lords, the earl of Powis, who was the recorder of the borough, had interfered in l an unconstitutional manner; and that lord Redesdale, who decided the case, had been previously consulted upon the proceedings. The petitioners stated, that the burial ground at Ludlow being in so crowded a state, that as often as a corpse was interred, the disgusting spectacle of bodies only partly decomposed presented itself, they applied to the corporation for another; burial-ground, but that the corporate body paid no attention to their application. That, on inquiry, they found that some years ago one Charles Fox had left the corporation, in trust, a chapel and a burial-ground, and that, instead of fulfilling the duties of the trust, they had I pulled the chapel down, and let the burial-

<col>1611</col>
ground for ninety-nine years to one of their own body, at a rent of 1<i>l</i>. 14<i>s</i>. per annum. That in 1813 the petitioners commenced proceedings against the corporation, under sir S. Romilly's act, when the Vice-chancellor decided in favour of the petitioners, and declared the corporation to be no longer trustees. That this decision of the Vice-chancellor had been confirmed by the Master of the Rolls and lord Eldon, but the corporate body having appealed, the decisions of these judges were reversed; and that the unfair means already stated by the petitioners had been used in order to obtain that decree.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01480"><member>Lord Clive</member><membercontribution> said, that his noble relation (lord Powis) would be most anxious that no opposition should be made to the inquiry. He would state shortly the origin of this petition. The corporation of Ludlow had very imprudently accepted this trust of a ruinous chapel, which, after it had been the cause of great expense, they pulled down. The corporation had pulled it down as a matter of security; as it had twenty years before been presented as in a ruinous state. Undoubtedly, the Vice-chancellor and other judges had decided in favour of the petitioners; but sir A. Hart, conceiving that the case did not come under sir S. Romilly's act, advised the appeal to the House of Lords. Upon this advice, the recorder thought it necessary to ask lord Redesdale if it was a proper case to be appealed, and his lordship's advice was similar to that of sir A. Hart. The case was submitted to lord Gifford, to the present lord Chancellor, and Attorney-general, and the opinion of all was, that sir T. Plomer and lord Eldon had misapprehended sir S. Romilly's act. He hoped the subject would be strictly investigated, for he was sure that he should be able to prove that the proceedings of the corporation, to which he had the honour to belong, had been what they ought to be; and that there was not the slightest foundation for the imputation of corruption. From all the circumstances connected with the petition, he could not help suspecting that the signatures had been obtained either by the agent or the gamekeeper of a gentleman who had petitioned against the last return for Ludlow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01481"><member>Sir J. Yorke</member><membercontribution> asked, whether it was true that the burial ground was in this disgraceful state, and that the corporation had let the burial ground attached to the chapel to one of their own body?</membercontribution></p>
<col>1612</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01482"><member>Lord Clive</member><membercontribution> said, he felt some delicacy in answering the question, because he might appear to be saying more in praise of his noble relation than he should wish to say. But the fact was, that the church burial ground being small and inadequate for so large a parish, he had made the parish a present of a piece of ground sufficient for a burial place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01483"><member>The Speaker</member><membercontribution> said, the petitioners stated a grievance, and prayed an inquiry into it, in order that it might be abated. But then they had a further prayer; and it appeared to him clear, that they could not receive a petition which prayed that House to interfere with the manner in which the House of Lords had performed their duty in their appellate jurisdiction. He suggested, that the petition should be withdrawn, in order that this prayer might be omitted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01484"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, he could not help thinking, that if injustice had been committed in the manner described by the petitioners, there ought to be a remedy for it. He would, however, follow the course that had been suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01485"><member>Lord Clive</member><membercontribution> hoped the hon. baronet would persevere in an inquiry, than which nothing could be more satisfactory to himself and his noble relation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01486"><member>Sir F. Burdett</member><membercontribution> said, he would certainly do his best to give satisfaction to both parties. He was not aware when he undertook to present the petition that he should be drawn into a position of so much responsibility.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ANATOMY.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01488"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> said, he had been requested to present some petitions which were of considerable importance. They related to the state of Anatomical Science in this country. The first was from the president and council of the Royal College of Surgeons. The petition was signed by sir W. Blizard, Mr. Abernethy, sir A. Cooper, and many other gentlemen of eminence in the profession. They stated, that they had pursued every means which the law allowed to procure anatomical subjects; that many were obliged to resort to France to learn a science so necessary to medicine; that the structure of the human body could not be learned by models; that the law required a man to possess a certain portion of information in his profession, and that they were liable to legal prosecution for
<image src="S2V0018P0I0814"/>
<col>1613</col>
professional ignorance. He really thought that every one must see the necessity of preserving to the country this branch of science; but he was afraid of a public discussion on the subject, when he recollected the prejudices which were found to prevail, more particularly among the lower orders. An hon. member would to-morrow bring forward a motion for an inquiry into the subject, and he should, therefore, reserve any decisive opinion until he heard the grounds on which that hon. member meant to rest his motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01489"><member>Sir J. Yorke</member><membercontribution> observed upon the number of suicides annually committed in London, and suggested that, in such cases, it would be proper to give up the bodies for dissection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01490"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> said, that the effect of making dissection at any time a penalty could only be to increase the aversion in which if was held by the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01491"><member>Mr. Peel</member><membercontribution> acquiesced in the opinion of the hon. member for Aberdeen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01492"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> said, that the expense of a course of anatomical study in Edinburgh was already twenty times greater than it was in Paris. It was so heavy, indeed, that not one pupil in four could afford fairly to go through it; and the result was, that great numbers were turned out, with very inadequate qualifications, to practise upon the community. He would not, at that moment, state his precise views upon the subject, but he believed it would be possible to provide all the supply that was necessary, without any offence to the feelings of humanity, or violation of the rites of sepulture. The poorer classes were vitally interested in some proper arrangement of the question, since it was to their lot that the danger from all unqualified or half-qualified medical practitioners must necessarily fall: there would always, whatever might, be the charge of education, be a sufficient quantity of skill and knowledge for the rich. With respect to the proposition as to suicides, he might just observe, that, in opposition to the common belief, it was capable of proof, that suicides were less frequent in England than in any country in Europe; and the giving up the bodies of murderers proved a source of supply entirely unworthy notice. For the last seven years the number of murderers had only averaged fourteen in each year, or one upon every eight hundred and fifty thousand on the population. It gave him
<col>1614</col>
pleasure also to observe how much the number of executions generally had decreased of later years. In 1733, the executions in London and Middlesex had been as one to ten thousand upon the population; in the last seven years they had only averaged one in seventy thousand. As for the question of the expediency of continuing the practice of dissection in cases of murder, it did not appear to him that any threat could add practically to the terror of the punishment of death. The true distinction to take between the crime of murder and less heinous offences would be to lighten the character of the punishments inflicted for the latter.

<title>CORN LAWS&#x2014;WAGES.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01493"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> begged to call the attention of the House to a petition in every way deserving it, not only because it was signed by nearly twenty thousand persons engaged in the pursuit which gave employment to the artisan and revenue to the state, but as it involved principles of acknowledged importance, and which were daily pressing on the attention of the statesman, the philosopher, and the economist. He felt, moreover, peculiarly gratified in being the selected medium of communicating to the House the sentiments and feelings of so large and valuable a portion of his fellow-citizens, who might be considered as representing the claims of every class of men, under whatever denomination, who subsisted by their industry, and whose property was their labour. Unconnected with either of those great and conflicting interests whose struggles for ascendancy embarrassed the government and prejudiced the people, he had a steady and straight-forward course to pursue, and from which no inducement should divert him&#x2014;that of standing up at all times, and under all circumstances, as the unflinching advocate, however feeble, of equal rights and equal protection. Personally considered, it was no object to him, whether trade perished or agriculture flourished, for he had no community with commerce, nor with the lords of the soil. Springing from the people, he was of the people, and was proud of being their champion, either in or out of that House. At the present moment this petition was of peculiar interest, as it was intimately in alliance with a subject which absorbed, more than any other, the attention of
<image src="S2V0018P0I0815"/>
<col>1615</col>
parliament&#x2014;the Corn-laws. The present might not be the most suitable period to eater on the investigation of that question; but of one thing he was certain, that the course which the government had selected was the worst, as time, not very distant, would fatally demonstrate. Disguise the matter as they would, the policy of the ministers was prohibition in corn, at the same time they had not the courage to say so. That a high protecting duty would, for a period, be advantageous to landlords, he did not deny&#x2014; and it was equally so to those who were fettered with covenants, stipulating for high rent; but a great and mischievous delusion was practised on the farmer generally, who had been led to believe that a measure which gave to the landlords high, rents would at the same time secure to them high prices. A greater fallacy was never palmed on credulity, and so the farmers would discover; for while they were excited to be of good cheer, and to live in expectation of improving times, instead of finding light hearts they would have light pockets, until the sequel would make every tenant a pauper, and every pauper a criminal. Still such was the policy of the government, who had been compelled to yield to a power they had apt the courage to resist nor the virtue to abandon; and he now called on those of his majesty's ministers, whom he saw in their places, especially those of them who had. been hallowed as the apostles of free trade, and also pretended to have got ". guarantees" for their accomplishment, to tell to the petitioners&#x2014;and through them to the industrious millions of our agricultural labourers, our ingenious artisans, our mechanics, what plan they had in store by which protection was to be given to their labour, which was not only their sole property, but the source of all that wealth of which the few had so much, and from which the many were unhappily estranged. Are we to be told that the people, having no, parliamentary influence, were of no importance? that interest and not industry was the exclusive object of their concern? Such deadly doctrines will not be tolerated for ever. Let the ministers speak out, that the people, may at least know their doom. Do they mean to assert that opulence is to be maintained by oppression? and that the rents of landlords are to be kept up by a system which, while it makes bread dear,
<col>1616</col>
renders labour worthless; which compels a man to work hard and long, and then closes the markets against the sale of his productions? [hear, hear.] The petitioners are too candid, too intelligent, and too ingenuous, to advocate a system of exclusion; they ask for themselves and for the country an unrestricted exercise of their manual and mental labour, in whatever way and by whatever means it can be usefully directed. But they proceed to state, if government deem it expedient to pursue an opposite course, and while they admit the desirableness of free trade deny its practicability, then they claim to be brought within the same circle of protection which they so readily grant to the landed interest. Equal rights for unequal conditions is their motto; and the denial of their claim would be an act of the foulest injustice. He might be told, that labour must be left to find its own level; that no plan can be devised by which protection can be extended to the working classes. But he would ask, if. it cannot be accomplished, why erect the fortunes of the privileged few on the overthrow of the industrious many? A system of government which gives an artificial dignity to the idle, by degenerating the people, is a bad system, and cannot be tolerated. But though it was not his place to suggest plans and remedies, it was the duty of government to provide them; and if his majesty's ministers would apply the same means to secure a remuneration price to the labourers as they did to obtain high rents for landlords, they would find its accomplishment less difficult and more meritorious. The hon. member said, he would only further remark, that at no distant day this important subject must receive the earnest consideration of parliament&#x2014;things could not remain as they were. There seemed a desire in some to get rid of the poor, in tearing them up by the roots, and transplanting them from the land of their fathers to some inhospitable region, they cared not where; while others seemed even inclined to annihilate the Poor-laws, a system of maintenance which, though greatly abused, he did not hesitate to declare as the best practical demonstration of the benevolence of the Christian religion [hear, hear]. For one, he was equally opposed to the inhumanity of compulsory emigration, and to all interference with the provision for the poor. There was no mystery in the request
<image src="S2V0018P0I0816"/>
<col>1617</col>
of the petitioners&#x2014;it was manly, honest, and just&#x2014;and he would conclude by reading the last sentence of their petition, in which he cordially concurred:&#x2014;"Your petitioners are therefore desirous of calling the attention of your honourable House to the necessity, either of adopting some legislative regulatory measure tending to insure a liberal and fair remuneration rate of money wages throughout the United Kingdom, or immediately to abolish all existing monopolies, admit an unrestrained importation of Corn, and all other articles of subsistence and comfort; and to reduce the salaries and pay of all placemen and pensioners, and fixed money obligations, as shall cause a reduction of taxation equivalent to the reduction in the rate of wages."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01494"><member>Mr. Fyler</member><membercontribution> said, that reference had been made, on this subject, to the principle of political economy, that labour should be allowed to find its level like every other commodity. That might be very true in a new state, where the demand for labour was equal to the supply; but it would not do in a country like this, where the disproportion between labour and the demand for it was so great. He concurred with the hon. member, that the petitioners were entitled to protection in the price of labour, which was their only commodity, as much as other classes who had been protected by legislative enactments. The principle on which the petitioners went was not a new one. It was admitted in the Spitalfields act, which was in force some few years ago. There were no doubt many objections to that act, but they would not apply to a general act of that description&#x2014;an act by which a committee of the masters and journeymen might meet at. stated periods, and fix a scale of prices by which the majority might bind the minority. The petitioners did not call for a fixed scale of prices, but that committees of the employers and employed should have the power of meeting and regulating the prices according to circumstances. He did not say that this would have an immediate effect in raising the price, but there could be no doubt that it would quiet the minds of the workmen, prevent those fluctuations of prices to which they were now liable, and enable them to make such calculations as would meet their wants from day to clay. He hoped that government would turn its attention to this important subject.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1618</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01495"><member>Mr. C. Grant</member><membercontribution> said, he was ready to do justice to the character of the petitioners, and to the eloquent manner in which their case was introduced; but without now going into the general question, he would observe, that that which the hon. member who introduced the petition had only indirectly glanced at was broadly stated by the hon. gentleman who last addressed the House. The principle which that hon. member advocated was, that a general act should be passed regulating the rate of wages in the several manufacturing districts; that was, that the principle of the Spitalfields' act, which had been very properly repealed, should be revised, and made applicable to all the manufacturing districts. If this were not conceded to them, they asked that there should be an abolition of all monopolies, a free trade in corn and other necessary articles, a reduction of taxes and pensions, and other matters which would embrace a very wide field of inquiry. Now, he could see no necessary connexion between the two prayers of the petition. It did not follow that because there was not a free trade in corn and other articles, and a reduction of taxation, that there should be an act for regulating wages. For the sake of the petitioners themselves, he should deprecate any such measure; for he was sure it would be found to injure them to a very considerable extent, and he was surprised &#x0021; that the experience of the Spitalfields measure did not show them the evil consequences of establishing a fixed rate of wages. One effect of that law in Spitalfields was to drive a great part of the trade from that district to other parts of the country. He was surprised it was not thought of, that the proposed general measure would have the same effect on the kingdom, with reference to other countries, which the Spitalfields act had on that district, as compared with other manufacturing places. But the fact was, that the silk trade, at present, was not in such a state of depression as to require legislative interference. Four or five years ago, a man might earn from 25<i>s</i>. to 30<i>s</i>. a week, at particular kinds of silk; but now, by changes in the fashion, the same silk was not in request, and the greater part of the trade was in silk of an inferior kind, at which a man could earn about 17<i>s</i>. or 18<i>s</i>. a week. He could wish it were more; but still he must say, that the trade was not so depressed as to
<image src="S2V0018P0I0817"/>
<col>1619</col>
call for any legislative measure, and that if ever there was a case in which the principles of free trade were completely triumphant, it was that of the silk trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01496"><member>Mr. Hume</member><membercontribution> concurred with the right hon. gentleman in his remarks as to free trade. On that point he thought the petitioners in error, and also in their opinion as to the regulation of wages; but he concurred with them in their call on the legislature for the same measure of protection that was given to the richer classes of the community. This might be considered the petition of all the working classes; to they all concurred in the principle, that, if they could not obtain the protection for their trade, they should at least have the advantage of a general extension of the principle of free trade, so as to do away with all monopolies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01497"><member>Mr. A. Dawson</member><membercontribution> denied that the petitioners asked parliament to regulate the rate of wages. AH that they wished was that a committee, composed of the employed and the employers, might be enabled from time to time to make such arrangements, as circumstances might require. If such a plan were practicable, it might prove very beneficial; and it would at least remove a cause of discontent from the minds of thousands of human beings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01498"><member>Mr. P. Thompson</member><membercontribution> expressed his firm conviction, that if any act were passed to regulate the rate of wages, not a twelvemonth would elapse before petitioners would crowd to the House to implore its repeal. If ever there had been a triumphant illustration of the principles of free trade, it existed in the present state of the silk trade; which had increased within the last eighteen months more than it had done for the preceding forty or fifty years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01499"><member>Mr. Alderman Waithman</member><membercontribution> very much doubted whether the silk trade had improved generally, although in some descriptions of articles it might have done so. The very statement of the right hon. gentleman, that the workmen who, four or five years ago, could make 30<i>s</i>. a week, make now only 16<i>s</i>. or 17<i>s</i>., was a proof of this. The proof of the prosperity of that, or of any other trade, was to be found in the importation of the raw material, and the exportation of the manufactured article. Now, with respect to silk, we exported a great deal of raw material, and imported a large quantity of manufactured goods. For his part, be was quite at a
<col>1620</col>
loss to know what kind of reciprocity had been established between this country and France on this subject. It was undoubted, that there had been a great reduction of the profits of weavers, and of all persons concerned in the silk-trade. The petitioners threw the House into the dilemma of answering their question&#x2014;why they protected other trades if they did not protect theirs. The petitioners said, if the House could not throw off all restrictions from trade, they should do the best they could with reference to corn and other, things.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01500"><member>Mr. D. W. Harvey</member><membercontribution> expressed his regret that the government appeared disposed to sacrifice the manufacturing interest in order to advantage those who benefitted by the monopoly of the com trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01501"><member>Mr. F. Lewis</member><membercontribution> said, that the silk manufacturers at present enjoyed a protection amounting to thirty per cent on manufactured goods. Under these circumstances it was not right to accuse government of sacrificing the manufacturing interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01502"><member>Mr. Alderman Thompson</member><membercontribution> admitted that the silk manufacturers were protected to the extent of thirty per cent, but then the corn growers were protected to the amount of seventy-five per cent. Thus the manufacturers were prejudiced to the extent of forty-five per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01503"><member>Sir G. Philips</member><membercontribution> expressed his surprise that the right hon. gentleman should maintain that the manufacturers were placed on an equal footing with the growers of corn. For his part, he believed that protecting duties had none but a bad influence on manufacturers. If every protecting duty on foreign manufactures were removed, he believed the manufacturers would be improved thereby.</membercontribution></p>

<title>FEES ON TURNPIKE BILLS.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01505"><member>Mr. Littleton</member> moved the order of the day for resuming the adjourned debate, on the resolution, "That after the present session, all Bills which, among other matters, shall contain provisions for the renewal, or repeal and renewal of any act or acts of Parliament, previously in force, for maintaining any Turnpike Road or Roads, be exempt from the payment of all Fees now chargeable, according to the table of fees of this House."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01506"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> rose to oppose the resolution. The object of it was to declare, that henceforth no fees should be paid on the renewal of turnpike
<image src="S2V0018P0I0818"/>
<col>1621</col>
bills. The fees now derived from that source, were paid into the treasury, and if those fees were taken away, the public must be burthened to the same amount. The fees were, it appeared, not greater at present on this class of bills than they were a hundred and thirty years ago; and if the hon. member's motion was acceded to, the alteration this must produce in the funds applicable to the payment of certain officers in that House would cost the public at least 10,000<i>l</i>. yearly. These considerations must prevent his acquiescence in that motion; but he was disposed to meet in part the wishes of the hon. member, and to propose an amendment, which would have the effect of modifying the proposition now made, whilst it acquiesced in its spirit, as far as he considered that acquiescence was safe and judicious. Where such bills were merely a renewal of preceding bills, he would admit that they ought not to be subject to the fees usual upon the original turnpike bills; in other words, where the trustees, by their application to parliament, did not attempt to obtain an advantage to the trust at the expense of the public, or did not require that the property of private individuals in the line of road should be sacrificed or disturbed, to carry their object into execution, then bills of this nature should be exempt from fees. The right hon. gentleman then moved as an amendment, "that in all cases of bills intended to continue turnpike bills, about to expire during the then session of parliament, the fees incidental to such bills payable to officers of that House shall be disbursed by the public, provided that no such bill shall compel any alteration or surrender of private property, nor propose to take or collect any new toll, or increase the toll taken under the existing acts of Parliament."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01507"><member>Mr. Littleton</member><membercontribution> said, he could not accede to the amendment, because it could never produce the effect contemplated by the original proposition. There was scarcely an instance of a bill being introduced to renew another, without possessing a clause which suggested or provided for the improvement of the line of road; and yet, if the House adopted the amendment, any such provisions would render the bill liable to the payment, of fees, although every one must admit that these were improvements in which the public at large were as much interested as the trustees of the road,</membercontribution></p>
<col>1622</col>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01508"><member>Mr. Davies Gilbert</member><membercontribution> admitted that it would be extremely improper to check the progress of improvement by rendering bills of this nature liable to the payment of fees.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01509"><member>Mr. Cripps</member><membercontribution> said, there existed a necessity for a denned table of fees, payable on bills introduced to renew turnpike acts, in order to prevent the recurrence of instances of enormous expense.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01510"><member>Sir J. Mackintosh</member><membercontribution> agreed, that bills for the renewal or the regulation of Turnpike bills, if they effected no material alteration in the nature of their enactment, ought not to be liable to the payment of fees. Turnpike bills were a great public benefit, and distinguishable in their nature from private property. It was therefore no violent proposal that they should be included in those regulations which the House was in the habit of extending to public measures. The resolution of his hon. friend would be a great improvement, and could be attended with no inconvenience.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01511"><member>Mr. R. Gordon</member><membercontribution> thought it would be a great advantage if turnpike road bills were considered as public bills. The roads were not for the accommodation of those through whose estates they were made, but for that of the public in general. He thought the process of engrossing might be dispensed with, in cases of simple renewal; which would be a saying of 20<i>l</i>. upon each application.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01512"><member>Mr. Secretary Peel</member><membercontribution> was willing to admit, that if, upon investigation, it should appear that the amount of fees taken on turnpike bills was unreasonable, a reduction should take place. But the House should pause when they came to consider whether the expense should be defrayed as a local burthen or transferred to the public. For his own part, he was disposed to think, that it would be better to continue them on the present plan; for, if transferred to the public, there was reason to apprehend that there would be less vigilance exercised in watching their progress, and scrutinizing their necessity, than if conducted upon the principle of local charges. Nothing could be more a public benefit than the prosecution of offenders, and yet the expenses incurred under this head fell upon the local districts in which they took place. Far these reasons he would vote against the resolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01513"><member>Mr. Wynn</member><membercontribution> considered turnpike bilk not as private but as public benefits, and consequently unfit subjects for taxation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S2V0018P0-01514"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> concurred in the opinion, that the fees on the renewal of such trusts should be considerably reduced; but the great expense of such bills did not arise in that House, but consisted in the charges of solicitors and agents. He was willing that the fees should be regulated, but not that the charge should be transferred to the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01515"><member>Sir T. Acland</member><membercontribution> said, that the real question was not whether these bills should be exempted from the same charges as other bills, but whether they should not be put on an equality with other private bills. In other bills the tax was paid once, and for all; but Turnpike bills were obliged to be renewed every twenty-one years, when the same charges must be paid as on their first introduction.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LIFE ANNUITIES ACTS REPEAL BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01517"><member>The Duke of Wellington</member> moved the order of the day for the second reading of the bill entitled "an act to Repeal so much of several acts as empowers the commissioners for the reduction of the national debt to grant Life Annuities."</p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01518"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> thought that no person, except the father or the dry-nurse of them, could object to the smothering of bills by which the public had lost so many millions of money. He had, therefore, no wish to object to the present bill, which seemed intended to correct the blunders of former political quacks. "Quam parv&#x00E2;, sapientia regitur mundus&#x0021;" was a well-known maxim, but the framers of those bills could not have been gifted even with that little wisdom; for more foolish bills had never passed through parliament. It seemed scarcely credible that any person belonging to the Treasury should have put into operation two bills which actually counteracted each other. At the end of the last war there remained a permanent debt, and a large burthen of life annuities to the army and navy. A change was effected in that disposition of the debt by a good many nostrums of quacks. By the dead bill, one project was to relieve ourselves from paying the present-life annuities, by distributing it over a larger surface and making smaller annual payments. Another pro-
<col>1624</col>
ject was also put in execution. We had a large permanent sum to pay; and, in order to relieve ourselves we created life annuities, doing the very reverse in this instance of what had been done by the other bill; for we got rid of life annuities by converting them into a permanent debt; and we converted a permanent debt into life annuities. Two more absurd and counteracting schemes he had never known. What private gentleman, supposing him to have granted mortgages and life annuities on his property, would grant more life annuities to relieve himself from the mortgages, and grant mortgages to relieve himself from the life annuities? In all the mismanagements and blunders of politicians, there had never been any thing equal to that; nor had that absurd system been persevered in without the parties being made aware of it: for he found in a letter from Mr. Finlayson to J. C. Herries, Esq., the following passage:&#x2014;"It is now a period of eight years, since I had the honour of pointing out to lord Bexley, the then chancellor of the Exchequer, the loss, as now demonstrated, which would be incurred by the public." Notwithstanding that letter, nothing had been done. Why was not a bill brought in upon the very day when the loss was pointed out? At the time when these bills were enacted, there existed the Law Insurance Company, and it was proposed to them to grant life annuities. The company said, however, that they could not do so without being ruined. They stated that, if they offered annuities on worse terms than the government, they would get no custom; and if they offered them on as good terms as the government, they must be ruined. Mr. Finlayson had made another remark. Alluding to the manner in which accounts were drawn up to be presented to parliament, he stated that, from some cause or other, three columns had been interpolated, by which a balance was presented, which was altogether fallacious. Whatever might be said of Mr. Finlayson's accounts as a whole, one part of them was very clear. It appeared that upon the annuities granted in the first year of the operation of the act, the public had been losers to the amount of 10,750<i>l</i>. We were now he hoped, relieved from all political quacks and mountebanks, and had got into a clearer and more intelligible line of politics. The public had undergone copious evacuations. First of all Van Butchell had been
<image src="S2V0018P0I0820"/>
<col>1625</col>
called in, who prescribed strong purgations; and then Dr. Eady was sent for, who perfectly agreed with what Van Butchell had clone, and said that, if he had been called first, he would have done the same thing. Five acts were then enacted. First there was the 48th of George 3rd. "Purgare," says the doctor. Then came the 49th of George 3rd. "Iterum purgare." Then the 52nd of George 3rd, for the purpose of relieving the patient, "Repurgare," writes the doctor. Then the 56th of George 3rd, "Clysterium donare:" and afterwards the 57th of George 3rd, "iterum clysterium donare." It was very fortunate after all this, that out of respect to the retired practitioner, nothing more was said than that it was expedient to repeal those acts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01519"><member>Lord Bexley</member><membercontribution> hoped their lordships would excuse him if he offered a few observations in consequence of what had fallen from the noble baron, who, if he had taken the trouble to look into the accounts, might have spared himself the trouble of making those remarks. Whatever might be the merits or demerits of that system which it was the object of the present bill to abolish, it was not on him that the praise or blame should lie; the only fault that could be imputed to him or to his successors was, that they did not proceed to alter the law. It was in Mr. Perceval's time that the life annuities system had been established; and so far from its being a favorite with him, he had cautioned Mr. Perceval of the probability of its not answering the purpose intended. However, Mr. Perceval was persuaded of the advantages of the plan; and, after consulting the best authorities upon their assurances, he submitted it to parliament. He thought, if the noble baron had read Mr. Finlayson's letter with any attention, he would have spared many of his observations. Mr. Finlayson, so far from imputing blame to him or his successors, stated that they had followed the only course which lay open to them; which was, that when he had pointed out, in 1819, that the public was a loser by the transaction, they directed him to make himself master of the subject, and gave every facility to his investigation. That gentleman, then, was far from attributing any fault to him: indeed, he would have been to blame if he had acted upon opinions not digested or matured five years after he had left office. His successors
<col>1626</col>
would likewise have been to blame if they had acted upon those opinions before any report had been made by Mr. Finlayson respecting the result of his investigation. So late as last January no report had been made on the subject, and he did not know whether at the present time any report had been made. With respect to what Mr. Finlayson stated about a loss of 8,000<i>l</i>. per week, in consequence of these acts, all he could say was, that that gentleman never mentioned any thing of the kind to him. He stated generally, that he believed there was a loss; but anything of that extravagant kind he never stated, and in consequence of his statement, he was directed to proceed in the investigation.&#x2014;His lordship stated, that he thought it desirable that the permanent debt of the country should become less, nor could he see, in the means adopted to effect that object, the inconsistency which the noble baron supposed; namely, by exchanging an actual and permanent debt for one which, in the course of time, would extinguish itself. He intended, on moving for some returns, to take the opportunity of stating the reason for the enactment of those acts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01520"><member>Lord Goderich</member><membercontribution> wished to say a few words on the course pursued by government, with respect to the question of life annuities. It might be possible, he thought, to find quacks in other posts besides that of a minister. The noble baron seemed to think their lordships' House as a repository for his wit. He would not, however, follow his example, but would leave the noble lord to favour their lordships with his critical lectures. With respect to the present question, all that was incumbent on him was, to explain how it happened that no step was taken by him in consequence of the representations of Mr. Finlayson. With respect to the letter to which the noble lord referred, it would be seen by the date, that that letter was addressed to the Treasury at a time when he had no connexion there; namely, on the 30th of April, 1827. He never saw nor heard of that letter, until the commencement of the present year, after parliament had met. Some time after that letter was written, he had become chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. Finlayson called upon him and produced two handsomely bound books, containing some of the most complicated and intricate calculations he had ever been
<image src="S2V0018P0I0821"/>
<col>1627</col>
called upon to investigate. Of course he thought it his duty to examine the subject as far as he could. Mr. Finlayson stated, that the two books were the commencement of a series of inquiries which he was engaged in, by the direction of lord Bexley, for the purpose of bringing to the test the idea which had occurred to him, that the duration of human life, especially of female life, was much longer than had generally been assumed. If Mr. Finlayson's idea should turn out to be true, then undoubtedly the annuities given under Mr. Perceval's act of 1808, involved a loss to the public; because they were founded on the supposition, that the duration of human life was not more than that laid down by Dr. Price. The subject was one of great importance. It certainly was quite new to him to be told that the tables of Dr. Price were so erroneous. Every person differed more or less as to their accuracy; but they were the foundation upon which all annuities were granted. Though it might be true that the investigations of Mr. Malthus tended to throw doubt on the accuracy of those tables, yet, at the time he was speaking of, nothing had appeared to justify any man of common sense in assuming any new basis of calculation. Mr. Finlayson had very extensive schemes in his own mind, not only with respect to the alteration of those acts, but to every possible combination. He therefore thought it his duty to desire him to proceed in his inquiry, and accordingly employed him at the public expense. Knowing the intricacy of the subject, and knowing him to be a diligent and active man, he certainly considered that Mr. Finlayson was proceeding in his inquiry, as fast as the nature of the subject permitted him; He always said, that he would not proceed to submit a new plan to parliament until the whole subject was investigated; for, to come down to parliament, pretending to have made a great discovery, having only piece-meal information, was not a part of his medical practice, whatever quackery he might be in the habit of indulging. Mr. Finlayson's salary was 500<i>l</i>. per annum; and he thought it high time that the matter was brought to a termination.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01521"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution> said, that the
<col>1628</col>
object of the sinking fund was neither more nor less than to save posterity part of the burthens which would otherwise fall upon them; while the object of the dead weight was to serve the present generation. If those were not contradictory propositions, he knew not what contradiction was. He thought the noble lord opposite ought to be very cautious in receiving Mr. Finlayson's calculations. There was a sort of impetuosity and hurry in making this discovery which made him receive his future information with less readiness of conviction than he otherwise should have done. The present bill was founded on the supposition, that the public incurred an annual loss by the Annuities acts. He wished to know whether those who had brought the bill forward had considered what was the price of the funds, and how far that price was advantageous, even admitting their calculations to be correct. If they had made such a consideration, they, perhaps, would not have been so hasty in bringing forward an accusation against their predecessors in office. He thought the tables respecting the duration of life must be taken to be drawn up in favour of the offices which granted annuities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01522">The bill was then read a second time.</p>

<title>PENRYN DISFRANCHISEMENT BILL.]</title>
<p id="S2V0018P0-01523">Their lordships went into a committee on this bill. Counsel were called in, and several witnesses examined. After which a desultory conversation took place as to the day on which the consideration of this question was to be resumed. It was stated, that in consequence of the business fixed for Thursday and Friday, it could not come on before next week. To this it was objected, that so long a delay would occasion an enormous additional expense, as well as great inconvenience. Earl Grey proposed Saturday, but the lord chancellor feared he could not be spared from his judicial duties in the court of Chancery on that day. However, after some further conversation, it was agreed that the examination of the witnesses should be proceeded in on Friday evening, after the Irish question, fixed for that day, should be disposed of, and continued until twelve o'clock, and resumed at ten o'clock on the following morning.</p>
