Baroness Kidron amendment. I welcome it and I think that we have made
some progress. Of course, this issue is broader than just data
protection, so we have to ensure that we get the legislation right.
That Bill can only cover data protection, which is not the whole issue.
Also, it would be a backwards step if the Bill gave the impression that
the generality of measures did not apply to children because we have
specifics that do. I am happy to talk further to the right hon.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Ms Esther
McVey):</Member></B> I am here today to address the concerns that have
been raised about the structure of the Motability scheme. Let me first
say that the scheme provides important support for more than 600,000
disabled people and has improved and extended its offer over the past
few years. For example, in 2013, in my role as Minister for disabled
people, I summoned the chief executive and chair to explain the
excessive pay and bonuses of Motability scheme staff and the sums of
money held in reserves. Despite being told that the charity needed such
money for capital reserves, and the Charity Commission agreeing with
that, I pursued the matter with the Department and ensured that the
funds were used to benefit disabled people. The result was that
£175 million was used for transitional support for
claimants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0001.htm#18020841000240">In<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T10:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>

right hon. Friend the Member  for Portsmouth North (Penny
Mordaunt), Motability extended that transitional support. After
direction from the Department, the charity is now piloting a Motability
scheme to help children under the age of three who are not eligible for
the mobility component of child disability living allowance but who
rely on bulky medical equipment. The scheme has the potential to help
up to 1,800
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0001.htm#18020841000241">I<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T10:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>
must emphasise that Motability is an independent charity that is wholly
responsible for the strategic direction of the Motability scheme. It
has oversight of Motability Operations, the commercial partner that
operates the scheme under contract to the Motability charity. As a
company, Motability Operations is an independent commercial business
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Although the remuneration
of its directors and managers is a matter for Motability Operations to
decide, from the outside one has to question whether it is really
right. That view is endorsed by the Charity Commission, which said
yesterday that the Motability trustees may wish to consider the
reputational issues raised by the salaries being paid to its commercial
partner’s
executives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0001.htm#18020841000242">Motability<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T10:32:58"></hs_TimeCode>
was set up 40 years ago, with cross-party support. It has done much
good in that time, but today, anybody who looked at the size of the
reserves and pay packages would question the direction that Motability
has taken in allowing that to happen. Motability must listen to the
criticisms it has faced, not only in the media this week but over the
course of several years, and be receptive to change. As Secretary of
State, I want to see a clearer commitment from Motability that it will
maximise the use of funds to support disabled people’s mobility
and
independence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0001.htm#18020841000243">As<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T10:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>

point is that there is no risk; this is a no-risk situation. It is a
very good scheme for the disabled, but there is no risk. The reserves
are only half the picture—the banks are also profiting, possibly
to the tune of billions over the years, because they are bearing some
of the risk. Will the Secretary of State commit to reviewing the lack
of competition in the financing arrangements with the banks, which see
the large four banks making huge amounts of profit out of this scheme?
How can the banks be allegedly covering the risk, when Motability has
£2.4 billion in reserves allegedly to cover that risk? It is the
same risk, yet in fact there is no risk at all because the taxpayer is
guaranteeing the scheme.</hs_Para>

under the spotlight. I would like to work with him on that, to bridge
the divide of party politics and do what is right. We need to uncover
what is happening in the Motability scheme and to ensure that the money
held in the company’s reserves goes to the people that it should

for where we go next, an urgent request has gone to the National Audit

Motability package, that is a good use of the benefits that they get,

been a lifeline for many disabled people who have chosen to take part
in the scheme. As I have said, it is helping more than 600,000 people,
and we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater. For those whom
the scheme is helping, it is an essential lifeline, but if it could be

We<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T10:53:20"></hs_TimeCode> are obviously
disappointed about the removal of same-sex marriage in Bermuda. The

yesterday, ensures that Bermudians who have been legally married in

partnerships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0001.htm#18020841000287">Less
than a year ago, same-sex couples had no legal recognition at all under
Bermudian law. While the Act withdraws the entitlement for same-sex
couples to marry, it replaces it with a provision for domestic

Act is to provide domestic partners with the same benefits as married
couples, including provision for pensions, inheritance, healthcare, tax

immigration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0001.htm#18020841000288">After

a backward step for human rights in Bermuda and in the overseas

quite equal to everyone else and that they do not deserve—this

Authority, said the Prime Minister was misusing the statistics on
waiting times by comparing different things. In England, she uses time
from decision to admit to time of admission to another part of the
health service. In Wales, she quotes the entire time patients wait from
arrival, including decision to admit, to actual admission. When will
that be corrected? The Government’s statement said that they
accept the UKSA assessment, but their assessment of this target still
stands. That is bizarre. When will the correction be published, in

They said, “Deeds, not words”—the cry celebrating

is deeds, not words. So, will the Leader of the House explain why
former military wives are losing out on their pension credits because
they reached pension age before the rules changed? Deeds, not words,
on WASPI women. Deeds, not words, on the House of Commons
research that found that 86% of austerity falls on women. Cuts have
cost women £79 billion compared with £13
billion for men. Deeds, not words, on equal pay for equal work. The

more people than ever before feel able to come

this week of celebrating 100 years of women’s suffrage, it is
right that we recognise the bravery of those in the suffrage movement
and praise the great strides we have taken in our politics and our
society over the past 100 years. But we are also all too aware of the
unacceptable level of intimidation and aggression being shown towards
people in public life, often directed particularly at women, BAME and
LGBT+ candidates. Such behaviour clearly deters people from entering
politics and threatens our
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>. When
dealing with this very real issue, our Parliament must lead by
example<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000439">The
working group was set up last November by the Prime Minister, with the
support of all party leaders, in response to the very troubling
allegations of sexual harassment and bullying taking place on the
parliamentary estate. We all recognised the need for robust procedures
to change the culture in Parliament and for this place to set the best
example of a workplace that protects and supports all those working in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:53:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000440" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000440">In
my first statement, I said that urgent interim action would be taken,
and that was the case. The staff helpline was extended to include staff
of peers and others, with face-to-face counselling made available on
the estate; party codes of conduct were updated and published online;
and since Christmas, interim human resources guidance has been made
available to Members’ staff. Nevertheless, it was clear from an
early stage that there was a substantial amount to do if we wanted to
create a sound working environment that properly supports the more than
15,000 people who work for or with
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000441" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000441">I<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:54:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:54:44"></hs_TimeCode>
am hugely grateful to all members of the working group for giving their
time, consideration and indeed patience as we worked towards the
publication of this report. You were clear, Mr Speaker, that for the
House Commission to take up the new scheme, the response had to be
cross-party. Although there have been some challenging discussions, I
am pleased that that is what we have been able to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:54:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000442" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000442">The
group took extensive evidence, both in person and in writing, from a
wide variety of stakeholders, including parliamentary officials, staff
of MPs and peers, unions, academics, authorities on sexual violence and
legal professionals. The group also conducted its own survey, which was
open to a wide range of people and included a number of passholders who
had not previously been asked for their experience of bullying and
harassment<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000443" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000443">Many
people have devoted a considerable amount of time to this matter over
the past three months and, after more than 100 hours of discussion,
consultation and consideration, we have proposed a set of policies that
will fundamentally change the working culture in
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:55:33"></hs_TimeCode>. I
would like to turn now to those proposals.</hs_Para>

Parliament will agree a shared behaviour code, which will apply
to everyone on the estate or engaged in
parliamentary business regardless of location, and will underpin the
new policy. It will be consulted on, and will make clear the
behavioural expectations of everyone in the parliamentary community.
Secondly, the new complaints and grievance procedure will be
independent of political parties.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000445" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000445"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:56:09"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly,
it was acknowledged that sexual harassment and sexual violence are
different from other forms of inappropriate behaviour such as bullying
and intimidation. Therefore, separate procedures will be agreed for
those looking to raise a complaint regarding sexual harassment, and for
those with a complaint of bullying. This is an important distinction
and, although everyone has acknowledged the severity of complaints of
sexual harassment, evidence from staff made it clear that instances of
intimidation and bullying are in fact more prevalent. Fourthly,
MPs’ staff require proper HR advice—something that has
previously been lacking and will go a long way to helping to resolve
workplace
grievances<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:56:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000446" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000446">Importantly,
the new system will be based on the principles of equality; be
confidential and fair to all parties; be in line with the laws of
natural justice; and command the confidence of all those who use it.
The working group took advice at an early stage that, rather than
reinventing the wheel, we should work with, and build on, the many
sound processes and systems already in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:57:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000447" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000447">For
the benefit of Members, I turn briefly to the process for making a
complaint or raising a grievance against a Member of this House. As
colleagues will appreciate, the process for raising complaints against
other members of the parliamentary community— such as peers,
Members’ and peers’ staff, journalists and
contractors—will differ according to their particular role. All
the procedures are designed for the protection of staff and
parliamentarians alike and have fairness at their
heart<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:58:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000448" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000448">It
is intended that the House authorities will procure two independent
services: one to consider allegations of sexual harassment and
violence, and the other to consider workplace bullying and
intimidation. Both avenues will provide support and, where needed, will
investigate the complaint. Where informal resolution is not possible
and the complaint is upheld, it will be referred to the Parliamentary
Commissioner for Standards in the case of a Member of this
House<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:58:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
working group proposes that the commissioner’s role will be
expanded and reformed. She will have access to legal advice, and will
be able to impose a new range of lower-level sanctions that may include
a written apology, mandatory training or future behaviour
agreements<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:58:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000449" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000449">The
commissioner will be able to review any finding by the independent
investigator, and where she does so, she will ensure that her
investigations are also strictly confidential, that both the
complainant and alleged perpetrator have access to all evidence, and,
crucially, that each has the right to representation or to represent
themselves. Those measures will ensure
fairness<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T11:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000450" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000450">In
the most serious of cases, the commissioner will refer her findings to
the Committee on Standards. The Committee will be able to recommend to
the House that an individual is suspended, and the House will vote on
the recommendation. It is through this route that
the  
<?notus-xml column=1670?>existing Recall of MPs Act 2015 could be invoked. The trigger for recall
will remain the same as it is now, and there is no plan for changes to
primary
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000872" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000872">The<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T09:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>
working group fully recognised the fact that those who work in this
place are often in the media spotlight, and that vexatious and
malicious complaints are a risk. The new procedures will therefore
ensure that checks and balances are in place to guard against such
complaints.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000873" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000873">I
will now briefly outline the next steps. A motion will be brought
before the House and a debate will take place in the first two weeks
after recess. Any necessary equivalent steps will be taken in the other
place. It will then be for the House of Commons Commission to instruct
the House authorities to finalise the agreed processes and carry out
their
implementation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000874" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000874">I<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T12:01:00"></hs_TimeCode>

authorities are ready to begin this work via a series of workstreams
that will include, first, developing and consulting on a behaviour code
for Parliament; secondly, procuring the two separate services required
to support and investigate complaints of sexual harassment or bullying;
thirdly, procuring an HR guidance service for Members’ staff;
fourthly, developing a staff handbook for Members’ staff; and

working group will continue as a steering group to monitor the work of
the House authorities. It is our intention for the work to proceed at
pace over the next few months. Finally, six months after the start of
the new scheme, an appropriate body—covering both Houses and
having direct staff representation—will review the operation of
the new
processes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000876" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000876">In<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T12:01:26"></hs_TimeCode>

This ambitious report is a major step towards a safer, more
professional environment. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members

debated at enormous length within the working group. She will
appreciate that much of the evidence that we took demonstrated the

feel that they could come forward with their complaint and not find

key.</hs_Para>

the opposite token, my right hon. Friend is exactly right: we do live
in the media spotlight, so it is very often of great public interest
when a complaint is made even if that complaint is subsequently not
upheld. Part of the process, for the sake of both complainant and
alleged perpetrator, is that the independent investigation will be held
confidentially. It will be very important for natural justice that both
sides can present their side of the story and that the independent
investigator comes to a finding, which the Parliamentary Commissioner
for Standards can then review, should the alleged perpetrator require
her to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000465" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000465"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T10:54:30"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Pete Wishart" ContributionType="Start SupplementaryQuestion" HRSContentId="{7BF2F818-AA40-4CCD-B511-C8792C4A7C07}" PimsId="4656" UID="18020841001215" xid="647" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841001215"><B>Pete

Training was another area on which the working group had lengthy
discussions. I can see my friends on the working group inwardly
groaning—“Not training again.” We discussed the
need for extensive training to be made available. Of course, we were
not just considering issues around complaints about sexual harassment
and bullying. We were also dealing with issues raised by staff members
about how to properly recruit someone, how to properly discipline
someone, how to deal with conflict in the workplace and how to deal
with complications between staff of different teams and people who come
into contact with one another who do not necessarily have an employment
relationship at all. We looked at many different areas.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=1675?>about a culture change in paragraph 82 and training. That underlines the

Leadsom:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend will appreciate that this
has been an incredibly difficult balancing act. All of us on the
working group made it clear that the commitment to protecting the
interests of the complainant would be at the heart of this. That means
very often that the complainant does not want to and will not come
forward with a complaint if they then run the risk of being hounded in
the media and, in effect, having a trial in the full glare of the
public spotlight. That was one of the core areas we sought to address.
That inevitably means that there are compromises and these are matters
for the final discussions about procedures, where the right balance
should be secured between the public interest to know about a
perpetrator and the interests of the complainant to have their privacy
and confidentiality respected. It is a difficult area and we will need
to find that fine balance. I am sure that it will end up being on a
case-by-case basis, with very careful assessment by the independent

the people who work in this place—all pass holders—and
indeed those who work in our constituency offices, with the exception
for the time being of House staff because they are already subject to
the respect policy agreed some time ago, which protects them from

called, there are groans from Members on the other side of the Chamber,
as if to suggest that they are less important than anybody else. We
praise somebody from our own side and all too often the Whips on either

is saying. This procedure seeks to change the culture in this place. We
all have our own personal opinions about different
activities—what is right and what is wrong—but what is
very important is how the complainant feels. By having this independent
procedure, it will be possible for an individual to go and talk to
somebody to receive support and guidance and, where necessary, to have
an investigation if it is felt that something is serious and needs to
be addressed. Once we see the impact that that has on people—not
necessarily Members of this place; it could be anybody who works on the
parliamentary estate—and people start to see that there are
consequences, that will change the culture in this place. My ambition

editors who would argue that publishing the name of someone who has

Leadsom:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is exactly right, and that
goes to the heart of the challenge of ensuring that the
complainant’s desire not to be all over the newspapers and
social media is respected and upheld. The two services—one
dealing with sexual harassment and the other with bullying and
intimidation—will be independent and procured by the House
authorities on behalf of the House, and they will have strict
procedures for confidentiality. As would be expected, should those
procedures be breached—for whatever reason—there would be
severe consequences. Confidentiality will be a key part of that.
Similarly, the working group proposes that the processes of the
commissioner for standards should also be strictly confidential, and
having met her, I am absolutely sure that she will uphold that need for
confidentiality. My expectation is that all those involved in the
investigatory process will uphold the need for complainant

the<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T12:32:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Belfast South (Emma Little Pengelly) for her contribution. She had
a different perspective on this working group and she has been
incredibly constructive all the way through. The hon. Gentleman
mentions staff in this place. One key piece of evidence that we took is
that staff feel a strong need for proper HR guidance to be made
available to them. A number of issues were raised about members of
staff who resign simply because they feel that they are not happy or
not being treated well, and they do not know where to go. They
recognise the risks of talking to the press or to their MP, and rather
than cause a fuss they just leave. They are then left feeling
dissatisfied and unhappy, and that can affect their job prospects
elsewhere because they want to get a good reference and so on. It is
important, right across the board, that staff are able to learn about
their contractual rights through proper HR guidance, and that training
is made available for all those who manage or supervise staff. Many MPs
have a chief of staff or someone who manages an intern or an
apprentice, and we must make training easily available—online as
well as face to face—so that we support the desire among people
in this place to professionalise our working
environment.</hs_Para>

Mr Speaker correctly identified, I wish to pay tribute to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T12:35:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper). The people of Merseyside know only
too well the cost of attempting to silence the victims and campaigners
for those seeking justice. As the report makes clear, her personal
commitment to get to the truth on behalf of the victims of Liverpool
Community Health NHS Trust, her personal courage in asking difficult
questions of those in senior positions within the NHS, and the
persistence and precision of her search for accountability, are all
vindicated today. We in this House, and across the wider health and
social care services, owe her a debt. I also thank Dr Kirkup and his
team for this excellent report. As with his report on Morecambe Bay NHS
Foundation Trust, it is a clear, forensic, and at times devastating
account of failures in the care of Liverpool Community Trust by its
management, its board, and its
regulators.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000509">The
report covers the period from the trust’s formation in November
2010 to December 2014, and it describes an organisation that was,
“dysfunctional from the outset”. The consequences of that
for patient care were in some cases appalling, and the report details a
number of incidents of patient harm including pressure sores, falls
leading to fractured hips, and five “never events” in the
dental service—an incredibly high number for one
organisation.</hs_Para>

of the organisation were perhaps most starkly apparent in the services
provided at Liverpool Prison, where the trust failed to properly
risk-assess patients, including for nutrition and hydration, and it did
not effectively manage patients at high risk of suicide. The review
also identified serious failings in medicine management at the prison.
There are many more examples of poor care and its impact on both
patients and staff in the report, but what compounds the shock is the
lack of insight into those failings displayed by the organisation at
the time. This was the very opposite of a culture of learning, with
incidents under-reported or played down, warning signals ignored, and
other priorities allowed to take the place of patient safety and care
for the vulnerable.</hs_Para>

independent report on the Liverpool Community Health Trust lays bare a
catalogue of failure that caused harm to patients across Merseyside
between 2010 and 2014. It is a grim example of a repeat of the
regulatory pressures and board management failures at Mid Staffs. What
is of huge concern is that some of the failures came after the final
publication of the Francis report. As we have heard, incidents
identified in the report include the deaths of inmates at HMP
Liverpool, patients having the wrong tooth extracted by trust dentists,
and patients on intermediate care wards suffering repeated falls and
broken bones or ending up with pressure ulcers. We have to make sure

put on record our thanks from the Labour Benches to Dr Bill Kirkup and
his team for the work they have done in carrying out this investigation
and helping us to understand what has gone wrong. Today’s report
says that patients of community services suffered unnecessary harm
because the senior leadership team was “out of its
depth”. Let us be clear what lies at the heart of this:
unrealistic cost-cutting by the trust without regard to the
consequences that led directly to patients being harmed. The report
exposes serious problems around the scale of cost-cutting being imposed
on NHS trusts. In the case of Liverpool Community Health, the
motivation was the drive to achieve foundation trust status. The trust
disciplined and suspended staff who blew the whistle about poor care
and its controversial plans to slash staff to save money. What
guarantee can the Minister offer that trusts are no longer being
allowed to prioritise financial savings over patient care? What
protections have been put in place for staff who raise concerns about
cost-cutting?</hs_Para>

capacity of board members to challenge the trust. The NHS still faces
huge workforce shortages, so what update can the Minister give us on
how the 10-year workforce strategy has been received? What additional
measures will the strategy include to guarantee safe levels of
staffing  in all areas of the country, in community as well as

private providers to the NHS in another capacity.

Barclay:</Member></B> I thank the shadow Minister for his questions and
the manner in which he put them before the House. His first key
question was to what extent measures are in place to address this sort
of issue, should it arise again. Post Francis, and following
Sir Bruce Keogh’s review of 14 trusts with high
mortality rates, a new regime has been put in place. There is a new
chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Ted Baker, and a
specific regime involving NHS Improvement, which
commissioned this report. NHS Improvement has a new chair, Dido
Harding, a very senior figure from the business community.</hs_Para>

has put 37 hospitals into special measures so far. The methodology that
is used to alert regulators to areas of concern has also been revised.
For example, far more importance is now placed on staff and patient
surveys. However, it remains to be explained why a trust could pay so
many compromise agreements, for example, in response to so many staff
disciplinary issues. I assume that many concerns were raised by trade
unions locally, as no doubt the hon. Gentleman is aware. We must also
consider the extent to which earlier reports, such as the Capsticks
report, raised concerns that should have been addressed. That is why,

Barclay:</Member></B> I am very happy to work with my hon. Friend on
this. As she will be aware from reading the report, it is explicit that
the finances were there for the existing service. That is stated at the
outset of the report. What drove the problems was a wholly unrealistic
attempt to seek foundation trust status, with a cost improvement plan
that was simply undeliverable. There was a massive reduction, without
any attempt to reconcile that with serious issues on staff levels and
vacancies. As the report explicitly sets out, when staff raised those
concerns, they were bullied, harassed and on occasion suspended without
due cause. The culture has changed significantly, and measures have
been put in place for how the regime involving NHS Improvement
would address such issues and look

improvement plans.</hs_Para>

to which the culture was driving the problems, I refer to the remarks I
made in my statement. According to the report, the interim chief
executive went in and found a significant underspend—£3
million—in the district nursing budget, at the same time as
there were significant vacancies and patient harm. That culture was
driving the issue, and that culture is what we need to put an end
to.</hs_Para>

points, but particularly regarding whistleblowers. That was one warning
signal that clearly failed here. The regulations have been changed, as
he will be aware. In the past, there was a culture in which compromise
agreements were applied with gagging clauses attached. That prevented
visibility of the compromise agreements. That is why I asked, on
receipt of the report, why the compromise agreements that were paid
were not escalated to the board, and indeed what sight, if any,
regulators had of those compromise agreements. Clearly financial

number of steps are being taken, but the approach that underpins those
is that although we must create a duty of candour, enabling people to

can escape their responsibility by moving within the system. I have
discussed that with people in the NHS, and I believe there is a wide

Friend will be aware, and indeed has said, how bad the situation was at
Liverpool prison, where the trust had no understanding of what was
required of it in its role as health provider. That put healthcare
staff in a very difficult position. Does he feel that there is a need
for better liaison between health and justice in relation to prison
health facilities? Is the CQC really in a position to inspect them, or

with him that the standards of care for those in prison should be the
same as those in the NHS more widely. As he will know, NHS England took
over commissioning for healthcare services in prisons in 2013; that is
one of the changes that have been made. He will also know that the Dr
Kirkup’s report drew attention to local factors, including a
personal conflict of interests that goes to the heart of the
relationship between the trust and the prison. However, he is
absolutely right to allude to some wider issues from which we need to

gone into special measures, a significant number have not just moved
out of special measures,

discuss mentoring and support, particularly for those in their first
year out of medical college. Trusts have shown leadership on a number

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Guy

age.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000591" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000591">The
decision to equalise the state pension age for men and women dates back
to 1995 and addresses a long-standing inequality between men and
women’s state pension age. This change was part of a wider
social trend towards gender equality, but was also a decision, partly
as a result of European and equality legal cases, relating to
occupational pension
provision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000592" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000592">During
the Blair and Brown years, the then Government decided that a state
pension age fixed at 65 was no longer affordable or sustainable. The
Pensions Act 2007 introduced an increase in state pension age to ages
66, 67 and 68. The coalition Government brought in further changes
under the Pensions Act 2011, which accelerated the equalisation of
women’s state pension age and brought forward the increase in
men and women’s state pension age to 66 by 2020. During the
passage of this Act, Parliament considered a range of alternative
options, resulting in a £1.1 billion concession that capped the
maximum increase any woman would see in her state pension age at 18
months, relative to the Pensions Act 1995 timetable.</hs_Para>

raised the issue of communications in the November debate. Since 1995,
the Government have gone to significant lengths to communicate these
changes. People were notified with leaflets, an advertising campaign
was carried out and later individual letters were posted out. Those
affected by the 1995 Act changes were sent letters informing them of
the change to their state pension age between 2009 and 2011, with
letters sent to 1.2 million women. Those affected by the Pensions Act
2011 changes were sent letters between January 2012 and November 2013,
which involved sending over 5 million letters with an accompanying
leaflet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000594">Life
expectancy and state spending are what have driven these changes.
Society has changed in countless ways since the 1950s and life
expectancy is no exception. A girl born in 1951 was expected to live to
81, and a boy to 77. By 2018, the latest Office for National Statistics
cohort figures show an increase of over 10 years for newly born girls
and over 12 years for boys, to 92 and 89 respectively. Life expectancy
at older ages has also gone up during this period and is projected to
continue to increase in future
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000595">These
welcome increases in life expectancy of course have implications for
the state pension. As people live longer, they invariably also spend
longer in retirement. Had we not equalised the state pension, women
would be expected to spend over 40% of their adult lives in retirement,
a proportion which would only continue to increase. This situation is
not sustainable for any Government and means increasing taxes for the
working population. Going as far as some campaigners have urged and
revoking the 1995 Act would represent a loss of over £70 billion
to the public
purse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000596" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000596">The
state pension must be maintained on an affordable footing for future
generations of pensioners and taxpayers. That necessitated the
Government’s action to equalise and then increase the state
pension age through the Pensions Acts of 1995, 2007, 2011 and
2014.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=1694?><hs_Para UID="18020841000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000597">Any further
transitional arrangement would come at great cost. The Government have
considered many options and all of the proposals would be wrought with
substantial legal problems, as well as financial ones. Any amendment to
the current legislation which creates a new inequality between men and
women would unquestionably be highly dubious as a matter of law.
Causing younger people to bear a greater share of the cost of the
pensions system in this way would be unfair and undermine the principle
of inter-generational fairness that is integral to our state pension
reforms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000598">Let
me turn to some of the proposals from the debate. The Scottish National
party seeks a full compensation package of at the very least the
reverse of the 2011 Act. The SNP costed this at £8 billion, but
that is a vast underestimate: it would actually cost the taxpayer over
£30 billion and potentially even more. There is also no doubt
that the Scotland Act 2016 gives the Scottish Government the powers
they need to address this issue. The Labour Opposition have made
multiple suggestions, with many seeking the full compensation package
of £70 billion. In addition, they have proposed in their
manifesto keeping the state pension age at 66. That would cost over
£250 billion more than the Government’s preferred
timetable by 2045-46. Payments on this scale are simply unaffordable
and cannot be justified.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000599" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000599">The key
choice a Government face when seeking to control state pension spend is
to increase state pension age or pay lower pensions, with an inevitable
impact on pensioner poverty. The only alternative is to ask the working
generation to pay an even larger share of its income to support
pensioners. I believe that successive Governments have made appropriate
but difficult decisions to equalise and increase the state pension age.
A significant concession was made in 2011 so that no woman will see an
increase to her state pension age of more than 18 months,
relative to the 1995 Act timetable. To renege on our decisions and
further increase costs to the public, especially the working
population, would be unfair and
unaffordable.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="18020841000881" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000881">1.24

state pension for women born in the 1950s should be set in the wider
context of the Government’s—uninspiring, I have to
say—track record on pensions. Last July, the Government
announced that they would be bringing forward the increase in the state
pension age to 68 in 2037, justifying this on the increase in life
expectancy. However, in the same week, the renowned expert on life
expectancy, Professor Sir Michael Marmot, described how a century-long

then, statisticians from the ONS have revealed that by 2041 life
expectancy for men and women would be a year less than had been
projected just two years previously. In addition the ONS has revealed
that, although women continue to live longer in good health than men,
their healthy life expectancy has decreased since 2009. Yet more
evidence from Public Health England shows how deep
inequalities in healthy life 
<?notus-xml column=1695?>expectancy remain. On average, people in the UK are now projected to
live shorter lives than previously estimated. Does the Minister
agree?</hs_Para>

context that the Government are failing women born in the 1950s. This
statement does nothing to address the pensions injustice these women
face. The Government have had multiple opportunities to act, so why is
the Minister again refusing to use the opportunity of a motion passed
by this House to do so to take further steps? It is unacceptable that
we are having to make this same argument and raise the same points
again because this Government continue to refuse to help these women,
who are suffering and losing out due to the acceleration of the state
pension age and lack of proper notice. This issue is not going to go
away. Why do the Government continue to act as though it will? This
statement is, sadly but not unsurprisingly, yet another example of the
Government’s failure to give women born in the 1950s the dignity
and respect they deserve. It is a missed opportunity to take real
action.</hs_Para>

heard often heart-breaking stories from many thousands of women
affected by the changes about how the situation they face is one of
desperation and fear of poverty. Christine in my constituency is
62 and is now having to wait until she is 66 to retire, with
both her husband and her father having just died. In her words,
“Not that cleaning jobs are a bad thing, but I have never done a
cleaning job in my life and I am now having to do three cleaning jobs
to make ends meet until such time as I can retire.” That is
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000606">It
is to this Government’s shame that they refuse to recognise the
very real basis for the fears of women such as Christine. What
immediate measures will the Government take to address this appalling
situation? Does the Minister understand how difficult it is for many
women in their 60s to retrain and access decent work? What support will
his Department offer these women—or will he repeat the bizarre
proposal made from the Conservative Benches that they might take up
apprenticeships?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000607" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000607">As
we have repeatedly set out, there are several immediate actions the
Government could and should take, but time and again they have refused.
Can the Minister explain why he refuses to offer women affected by
Government changes to the state pension age the cost-neutral option to
draw their state pension at age 64, as we have proposed? That would
allow women who choose it to retire up to two years earlier.</hs_Para>

age is due to rise to 66 by the end of 2020. We reject the
Government’s proposal to increase the state pension age even
further. We will act by putting in place a new review of the pension
age, specifically tasked with developing a flexible retirement policy
that reflects the contributions people make, the wide variations in
life expectancy and the arduous conditions of some work.</hs_Para>

right to extend pension credit to those who were due to retire before
the increase in the pension age, which would benefit hundreds of
thousands of women. Will the Minister look again at that
proposal?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000610" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0002.htm#18020841000610">In
conclusion, sadly, this statement does nothing to help women born in
the 1950s. Actions are needed, not words, if the Government are to
restore some of the faith and dignity that many people feel they have
lost as a result of the Government’s refusal to act and to 
<?notus-xml column=1696?>introduce proper transitional procedures. These are the women of

Opperman:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. He
seeks an independent review of the state pension age. Well, the
Government did that last year. The Cridland review was independent of
Government and it published its conclusion, just as the Labour party

Labour party used to be financially credible, but sadly those days are
long gone. The Labour party, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, passed
the Pension Act 2007, which raised the state pension age. We now have
the bizarre situation in which the Labour party manifesto states that
the state pension age should not go beyond 66. In other words, it is
going back on its own decision in 2007. Its credibility is sadly
lacking.</hs_Para>

The shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions keeps relying upon
him, and the<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T13:31:45"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Gentleman repeated that today. Michael Marmot made it very clear
that “improvements in life expectancy at birth, which had been
around a one-year increase every five years for women, and every three
and a half years for men, have slowed since 2010 to a one-year increase
every 10 years for women and ever six years for men.” The point
is that the increase is still going ahead; it might have slowed to a
degree, but life expectancy continues to rise.</hs_Para>

party agreed in 2004 that the ONS cohort figures should be accepted and
then followed them thereafter. The ONS produced a report last December
on life expectancy at birth, which found that in 50 years’ time,
by 2066, cohort life expectancy at birth is projected to reach 98 years
for females and 96 for males, a rise of over six years for both
genders. In 2018 life expectancy at birth is projected to be 92 for

briefly on the Fuller Working Lives strategy, which I am sad to say the
Labour party seems no longer to support. There are 1.2 million people
over the age of 65 in employment, which should be celebrated. It is
entirely right that retraining might not be suitable for everyone, but
it is also right that Governments of every hue should provide
opportunities for those who wish to take those things up. For example,
over the most recent nine-month period, the number of apprenticeship
starts for people between the ages of 45 and 59 was 53,000, and for the
over-60s it was 3,400. That means thousands of people taking
opportunities for retraining. With respect, that should be

Five Conservative Back Benchers and six Democratic Unionist party

November, which is the second biggest rebellion in this Parliament.

Creagh</B> (Wakefield) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful to you, Mr
Speaker, and to the Backbench Business Committee for giving me the
opportunity to make this statement on behalf of the Environmental Audit
Committee about our third report of this Session, “The Ministry
of Justice: Environmental Sustainability”, which I am delighted
to share with the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000642">The
Committee’s remit includes carrying out regular sustainability
audits of Departments and agencies. Working closely with the National
Audit Office, we look at whether Departments are doing enough to reduce
their impact on the environment and meet their greening government
commitments. In the previous Parliament, we published sustainability
audits of the Treasury and the Department for Transport, and this is
our first audit of this
Session.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000643">The
Government are the largest purchaser of goods and services in the
country, and I pay tribute to the civil servants working across
Government to reduce their carbon footprint. The Government should be
leading from the front on sustainability. They have signed up to the
UN’s global goals, to the greening government commitments, which
commit Departments to reducing their impacts on the environment, and to
Government buying standards on procurement. All three are aimed at
improving sustainable
practices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000644" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000644">Why
did the Committee choose the Ministry of Justice? With 1,600 sites, the
Ministry of Justice has the second largest estate in Government. It
accounts for 20% of the Government’s greenhouse gas, waste and
water emissions. It is the second largest buyer of goods and services,
spending £4.6 billion through external suppliers in 2015-16,
which is 10% of total Government
spend<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T13:49:32"></hs_TimeCode> on
procurement. The Committee recognises the financial pressures that the
courts and prison services are under, but being green brings financial
benefits. UK businesses, for example, could save £23 billion a
year by improving how they use energy and water and by reducing
waste.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000645" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000645">The
Ministry has committed to put sustainable development at the heart of
everything it does, so with the assistance of the NAO, the Committee
examined whether that was happening. First, we were disappointed that
the sustainable development goals were not mentioned in the
Ministry’s single departmental plan, despite the Government
promising us that they would appear in every single departmental plan.
That is a worrying trend across Government. Secondly, our audit
uncovered significant weaknesses relating to how
the Ministry 
<?notus-xml column=1701?>manages its sites, buildings and refurbishment projects, carbon
emissions and vehicle fleet and in its approach to
policy
making.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000646" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000646">The
Ministry’s estate is one of the most ecologically diverse in
Government. Its prisons and immigration removal centres contain 10
sites of special scientific interest, only two of which are in a
favourable condition. We also found gaps in the Ministry’s
governance and oversight. Senior management are often not informed of
sustainability incidents. For example, we heard about one contractor
that destroyed a nationally important protected orchid meadow but was
not penalised or held to account through the
contract.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000647" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000647">The
Ministry wants all its new buildings to achieve an
“excellent” rating under the Building Research
Establishment environmental assessment method—BREEAM—and
it wants refurbishment projects to achieve a “very good”
rating. However, we found that the Ministry had not assessed the
environmental performance of nearly two thirds of its new-build and
refurbishment projects. Of the 54 that did get the certificate, 14
failed to meet the required standard. Not knowing the rating of a
building could not only lead to costs from retrofitting and poor energy
efficiency but risk inmates’ health through overheating. When a
cost-benefit analysis is put forward, it is predicated on good or
excellent standards being achieved, meaning that the building will cost
more to run and manage than expected and will not meet the case set out
for the
project.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000648" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000648">We
also examined Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service and its
courts closure programme. Since 2010, 103 magistrates and 54 county
courts have closed, and the Ministry is consulting on plans to close
nine more
courts.<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T13:49:53"></hs_TimeCode> There
were gaps in the guidance to staff on how to sell off court and
tribunal buildings, and the oversight on contractors also showed gaps.
For example, people tasked with selling the buildings were unaware of
their statutory duty to tell Historic England if the buildings were
listed or of particular local architectural significance, and they
failed to minimise the risk of new owners letting the buildings fall
into disrepair. In my constituency, Wakefield Crown court, sold off 20
years ago, has been left to fall into ruins, leaving my local authority
and local council tax payers to foot the
bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000649" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000649">The
Ministry of Justice did not meet its targets for domestic flights and
carbon reduction in 2014-15. In fact, its use of domestic flights is
increasing. We found that in one year there were 108 flights between
London and Anglesey and 98 flights between London and Cardiff, as well
as flights between Southampton and Manchester, even though perfectly
good train services are available. The Ministry did not provide any
explanation for the
increase.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000650" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000650">In
the autumn Budget, the Chancellor committed that 25% of all cars in
central Government Departments should be electric, yet only two of the
Ministry of Justice’s 1,500 vehicles are ultra-low emission
vehicles. We also found that the Ministry does not systematically
undertake environmental impact assessments of new policies. For
example, in February 2017 the Government tried to remove the fixed cap
on court costs in environmental cases, but they failed to consider the
environmental impact of that decision, despite environmental groups
saying it would have a “chilling effect” on access to
environmental justice.</hs_Para>

of Justice acknowledged many of its shortcomings during our hearing,
and it has been working to improve its oversight, systems and
performance. That is welcome, but we urge it to improve in three key
areas. We urge it to embed sustainability in all it does; to follow its
own guidance when making policy—it is ironic that the Department
tasked with upholding the law is failing to meet its own legal
requirements in certain areas—and providing guidance
to staff and contractors; and to improve oversight and governance of
sustainability, including in the governance of its contractors, such as
on buying standards for prison
food.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000652" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000652">We
recommend that the Ministry of Justice sets more ambitious
environmental targets for 2019-20, as we found it was setting its
targets too low so that it could say, “We have met the targets a
year or two early.” That is no good. The targets have to be
stretching, and they have to be on just the right side of impossible.
The Ministry also needs to develop its sustainability policies,
reflecting global goals, and it needs to set out how it will meet its
existing targets. It needs to improve its estate management and
systematically collect environmental rating certificates for all
refurbishment and new-build
projects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000653" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000653">The
Ministry of Justice should provide better support to staff, especially
prison governors and the people involved in selling courts and tribunal
buildings, and it should provide guidance and oversight to contractors
on how to manage the estate sustainably, including its sites of special
scientific interest, which are protected by law. That is particularly
important in the wake of the collapse of Carillion, which was a
contractor on several of the prisons we looked at. The Ministry must
improve its oversight of sustainability issues, and it must 
show leadership to the rest of central Government on
sustainability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000654" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000654">If
the UK is to be at the forefront of sustainability, the Government must
lead by example. All Departments must do their bit, and the Ministry of
Justice is failing to meet that challenge. Sustainability and the
environment have been bolted on as a bit of an afterthought. In the
Ministry’s response to our report, I expect to see a clear plan
that addresses our concerns and incorporates the global goals into
everything it
does.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000655" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000655">I

securing the debate. My first bank was the Midland bank when I was 11,
so I therefore discovered I had been a member of that bank for 24
years, much to my shock. On the question of shrinking bank services and
millions of people being affected, following NatWest’s decision
to close the banks in Maesteg and Pencoed there will be only one bank
left in my whole constituency. That is 58,000 people within a
geographical area with only one bank. Does my hon. Friend agree that
that is a shocking failure of the banking system and that the banks are
not following through on the community banking schemes that they are
meant to be doing to serve

Smeeth:</Member></B> I completely agree with my hon. Friend, although I
think many others will be astonished that he has had a bank account for
that long. There is a genuine issue about the responsibility of
community banking. When I got my first paying-in book, there were
20,585 branches across the country, but by 2012 that figure
had dropped to just 8,837. In the past three years alone, we have seen
a further 1,500 branches close, and that does not include the
announcement of further closures made in the past three
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000680">The
hole that these closures leave behind goes far beyond an empty shop
front. For the elderly or disabled, a 3 mile journey to the nearest
branch is more than inconvenience. In my constituency, Burslem,
Kidsgrove and Tunstall are all facing the loss of well-used local bank
branches and the impact on local residents and local businesses will be
severe. In Burslem, we are currently facing the prospect of losing our
very last bank branch, a local Lloyds. Burslem is the mother town of
the Potteries, as I am sure the whole House is aware. It is home to
Burslem School of Art and the Wedgwood Institute, to Port Vale football
club and the outstanding Titanic brewery. Yet if these plans go ahead,
there will no longer be a single solitary bank. What message does that
send to a community that is doing everything it can to support local
businesses and improve our town centre? When did community banking
become a phase devoid of
meaning?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000681" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000681">In
Kidsgrove and Tunstall, Co-op customers are faced with the prospect of
losing their local branches—the last remaining Co-op banks in my
constituency. As a Tunstall resident and a customer myself, I know how
popular the branches are and the impact that their disappearance will
have. Walk into any one of these branches at virtually any time of day
and people are queueing. They are used by hundreds of residents as well
as local
businesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000682" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000682">Petitions
against the closure have already attracted thousands of signatures, and
residents have contacted me about what the closures will mean for them.
I must thank Councillor Kyle Robinson for leading the campaign in
Kidsgrove, collecting more than 1,200 signatures so far, as well as Tom
Simpson, Lucy Kelly and local traders in Tunstall and Tunstall market
for their incredible efforts, as well as the wonderful June Cartwright

closures will have an immediate effect and impact on people’s
lives. I have heard from elderly constituents who use the Tunstall
Co-op branch and will be forced instead to travel 3 miles via
unreliable public transport to a city centre with no public
conveniences. For people in their 70s and 80s, or those with a
disability, this is more than an inconvenience—it is a genuine
struggle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000684" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000684">That
was brought home to me by a story from a constituent whose parents have
used the branch for many years. They are not technologically
savvy— a weakness I, and I am sure others across the House,
share—and they find it difficult to use an ATM or to pay for
things in shops using their debit cards. If the House will humour me
for just a moment, I want to quote what my constituent had to say about
this
matter:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="18020841000858" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000858">“My
parents are 81 and 83 years old and have used the Co-op bank in
Tunstall for many years. The staff know my parents very well. They are
exceptionally helpful, supportive, patient and ensure that they
understand everything that they need to. Knowing 
<?notus-xml column=1707?>that my parents have this level of support when I’m unable to be
there every day, provides me with a great deal of
reassurance, and I’m extremely grateful for
this.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="18020841000685" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000685">I
am sure that we all know people who benefit from this level of personal
service and for whom the faceless and bewildering world of online
banking simply will not work. In fact, in my great city too many of my
constituents do not even have access to the internet. In the past three
months, the Office for National Statistics suggests, up to 51,000
people, or one in four, aged over 16 in Stoke on Trent have not
accessed the internet. One in four. For the record, that is more than
double the national average, which makes talk of internet banking as
the panacea for this crisis nonsense for too many
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000686" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000686">For
businesses too, the closures present a challenge. For those who trade
primarily in cash it is neither safe nor practical to expect staff to
travel halfway across the city to deposit the day’s takings. And
for small businesses with a limited number of employees, the time that
this will take out of their day is a real hindrance. One of the
defences often given in advance of such closures is that nearby ATMs
will continue to be available, yet hundreds of them are at risk of
being closed down thanks to the proposed overhaul of the LINK
network.<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:17:27"></hs_TimeCode> What is

that is merely a snapshot of the human impact that the decline in
community bank branches is having on communities like mine. I am deeply
concerned about what will happen to our towns should these branches
disappear. I had hoped that the banks would share, or at least
understand, that concern. Instead, when I met representatives from the
Co-operative bank, which is no longer associated with the Co-operative
Group, my concerns were dismissed and ignored. When I pointed out that
the bank’s impact assessments were riddled with obvious
inaccuracies, its representatives merely shrugged and said that it
would make no difference to their decision. They treated me, and by

Growth in lending to small and medium-sized enterprises is dampened by
an average of 63% in postcodes that lose a bank branch, and that figure

does all that mean for towns such as Burslem, where local people are
coming together to lift their community up and push back against years
of decline? There was a time when the local bank was thought of as the
heart of the community—perhaps it still is—so what
happens to a community when it loses its heart? What happens when the
monetary circulation of a town is cut off mid-beat? What happens when
the last financial lifeline disappears and leaves the elderly and
vulnerable without support? The world we live in is not the same as it
was 10 years ago, let alone 40 or 50 years ago. Times change,
technologies change, and we must change with them. But we must also do
more to ensure that as the world moves, we do not leave behind those
who find it hardest to keep up. We must recognise that there remains a
place for community banking, local lending and face-to-face advice.
That means we need the banks to take some ownership and responsibility

directly, in their local communities. They could fund more extensively
community-based financial education to assist people with online
banking. They could even fund access to broadband in some of the harder

number of Members present is testament to how important this debate is.
Given the extent of bank branch closures, it is likely that we all have
an interest in this issue because of what is happening in our own
constituencies. In the past 25 years, the UK has seen the closure of
nearly 10,000 bank branches, which is over half of all of them. The
rate has accelerated, with more than 600 branch closures in the past
year. It is right that we should embrace technological change, but the
rise of new approaches, including online banking, means that we are
faced with the decline of traditional
banking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000705" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000705">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:19:04"></hs_TimeCode>
customers have a preference for in-branch banking. They prefer
face-to-face service and the chance to talk to people, to get financial
advice, to access their 
<?notus-xml column=1710?>money physically, and to have the security of seeing their bank
transaction take place and of receiving a paper record to prove it. In
recent times, against a backdrop of scandals, one of banking’s
redeeming features has been the personal relationships that banks still
offer to customers. Members of the community often struggle when a bank
closes, and closures are particularly important for elderly or
vulnerable people who may not use online
banking<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:19:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000706" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000706">In
recent years, my constituency has suffered from the closure of several
local banks. Like other Members, I am sure, my constituency postbag and
inbox have swelled as a result. In May 2016, Lloyds bank earmarked its
branch in Woodley precinct for closure as part of a cost-saving
measure. At the time, I presented a 583-signature petition to the House
on behalf of local residents, calling on Lloyds to reconsider its
decision. Despite that large demonstration of popular feeling, the bank
went ahead with the closure regardless. That decision made it harder
for hundreds of customers to access their money and to get financial
advice and that face-to-face service.</hs_Para>

NatWest has also recently closed branches in two local towns, namely,
in Romiley and in Marple. The last case was particularly galling as the
justification given by NatWest at the time of its closure of the
Romiley branch during the statutory consultation process was the
proximity of the Marple branch as an alternative. However, just a few
months after shutting the first branch, the bank announced its
intention to close the Marple branch, too. Customers who had taken
early assurance about a back-up branch in good faith felt that they had
been treated as fools and that the behaviour of the bank in this
instance made a mockery of the process of consulting on closures. Of
course, if customers feel sufficiently overlooked, banks may well find
that they start voting with their debit cards and switch
accounts<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000708" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000708">Although
I accept that decisions on bank closures are ultimately a commercial
decision, I urge all banks to show a lot more consideration of the
needs of customers and how they can best be met. They must think
carefully before making any decisions on a branch closure, particularly
in rural or semi-rural areas, which have been hard hit by these
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000709" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000709">Although
it may not be a matter for the Government to intervene directly in a
decision on an individual basis, the Government do have a role in
promoting general access to banking services. Therefore, I ask the
Economic Secretary to the Treasury to consider placing a duty on the
Financial Conduct Authority to promote financial inclusion as one of
its core objectives, as recommended by the Financial Inclusion
Commission. That duty could include a mandate to require financial
service providers to meet certain standards relating to access and
customer service. Such a duty should require the design of products and
services to be more inclusive and to maintain access to essential
services for people who may not be online.</hs_Para>

my research for this debate, I was pleased to learn that a lot of the
services offered by banks can now be done over the post office counter.
Post offices continue to offer basic banking services to many bank
customers. Indeed, around 99% of a bank’s personal customers and
95% of its business customers are now able to withdraw cash, deposit
cash and cheques and make balance enquiries at a post office counter.
All post offices can take cash deposits of up to
£2,000. However, that 
<?notus-xml column=1711?>begs two important questions on which I would like the Minister’s
thoughts when he winds up. First, what is being done to ensure that
local people are aware of the options available following the closure
of a local branch? Secondly, and perhaps most crucially, although this
is good news for customers, why is it deemed acceptable for privately
owned banks, and indeed publicly owned banks in some circumstances, to
close their own branches and rely on the state-owned Post Office to
process their transactions for them? Are they making a profit while the
overhead costs are met by the Post
Office?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000711" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000711">I

friends who work for the Royal Bank of Scotland, at all levels of the

bank; they are aimed at the system in general. In my constituency, we
face the closure of three RBS branches. One, in Tongue in north-west
Sutherland, may be on hold—there has been a stay of execution.
However, in the old royal boroughs of Tain and Wick, the intention is
to close the branches. I have never seen an issue that has caused so
much deep unhappiness among my constituents.</hs_Para>

social structure of these communities as the doctor, the minister and
the school teacher. I think particularly of what happens when someone
has, for example, a seed corn business—from little acorns mighty
oaks grow. The point is that, in the past and even in recent times,
someone with a business idea could go to the branch of their bank and
say to the manager, “I have this idea. This is my business plan.
Will you take a punt and lend me the money?” I have seen, in my
home town, some seriously big businesses grow in my lifetime from
absolutely nothing—there was a brave bet by the bank manager. We

account, with the Royal Bank of Scotland, was opened by my father when
I became a student. He put in £16—I did not see many
£16s after that. In due course, I spent all the money because I
was a young first-year student who did not know what he was doing. When
my grant cheque came in, I opened another bank account in the Bank of
Scotland and then I spent all that, too. The trouble came when the two
bank managers talked to each other and said, “Do you realise
that young Jamie Stone has two bank accounts and he is spending money
like water?” Then they went and told my dad. There was
absolutely no end of trouble over that. In a way, for those Members who
are experts on Adrian Mole, that conversation, perhaps not completely
correct today, headed off a potential multiple debt situation. I was
pulled up and stopped—well, I had to be—which was
probably to my great benefit in my life.</hs_Para>

someone in the branch of a bank who says, “Don’t worry.
What’s happened here is that the payment will not clear for
three days.” That can be the difference between peace of mind
and mental torture. It takes someone just to say, “Wait a
minute, I will go online and take a look. Oh, here’s the
problem. This is what’s happening.” You cannot take that
away. We talk about online banking. Well, let me tell Members: if I hit
the icon on my phone, it says that I have been logged out and, no
matter how hard I try, I cannot get back in again. I do not have a
clue, just like when I was 18, I do not know what my bank account is
doing. Therefore, online banking is not for everyone.</hs_Para>

underused building was not actually the best way for the police to
maintain a footprint in their community, and that there were more
innovative ways to maintain a presence in their local communities,
including the use of shared facilities, setting up pop-up shops in

must remember that local high streets are already under great stress.
High streets in rural areas have really been suffering from the impact
of globalisation and competition from online retail services. It is
very difficult for small businesses to keep their heads above water as
it is, so banking services are very important for them. If the
Government’s objective is to maintain the vibrancy of these high
streets—and I think it is—we need some active measures to
ensure that post offices are promoting the best banking services and
that these services are well publicised. We need banks to step up to
the plate and contribute to ensure that the banking services can be
universal and just as good as the services that were provided before.
All those things can be
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000734" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000734">I<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:37:08"></hs_TimeCode>

We must look forward to what can be created using the existing post
office network and ensure that services are provided properly. It does
not help to look backwards and think that we can somehow set a retail
banking model in aspic, when it is actually failing because it does not
provide the services necessary for the wider community and only
supplies a very small number of customers. We need banking services in

the need to think creatively about the sort of sustainable

not necessary in our cities, where we can walk down the street and pass

alternative banking, but no—I repeat, no—mechanism to
stop a branch closing. So the process for closure has been determined,
but a mechanism to halt a closure is non-existent. Communities have no
more chance of stopping the closure than they did in 2015. The
Government have done, and are doing, nothing to change this. “It
is a private matter; it is a commercial matter”, we have been
told on several occasions during Prime Minister’s questions in
recent times. The Government decline to 
<?notus-xml column=1716?>collect statistics on closures or on how many communities are now

banks would have us believe that this is a story of enlightened
pensioners managing their ISAs and direct debits on their smartphones.
The truth is somewhat harder to get to. This House, I believe, is not
nostalgic, nor opposed to telephone or smartphone banking. We are not
against people managing payment on their PCs. But the selective figures
provided by RBS-NatWest to justify closure give a completely distorted
impression of their NatWest branch to each of the towns in Don Valley.
For<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:42:22"></hs_TimeCode> example, RBS
was keen to tell me that 88% of Bawtry customers and 86% of
Thorne customers now bank in other ways, and that only 48 customers in
Bawtry and 69 in Thorne attend the branch on a weekly
basis—although the time period for this estimate was not
provided to me. Yet when a member of my staff went to the Bawtry
NatWest midweek in mid-January—a quiet post-Christmas
week—they saw a queue outside the bank before it opened at 10
am, and at 10.45 am they found a queue more than 10 deep in the bank,
with several counters in use. But when I asked RBS how many
transactions took place at the Thorne and Bawtry branches in the first
hour of each day since the new year, the bank refused to disclose this
information. It was “commercially sensitive”, I was told.
Nor would RBS furnish me with information on what proportion of the
customers are pensioners, how many transactions took place at each
branch in the past year, or why neither branch opened on a weekend. On
a Saturday morning, footfall could be more frequent.</hs_Para>

RBS’s chief executive, and to Les Matheson, NatWest’s

me with offers to meet a “senior representative” when you
refuse to provide any information that may demonstrate that small
businesses, pensioners or the community generally may need the services
provided in the Thorne and Bawtry branches more than you care to admit.
In response to a question about the possibility of branches sharing
premises to make them more viable, I was told by Mr Matheson that
NatWest’s arrangement with the post office means that the post
office is now “the shared premises”. On that basis, why
have any branches at all? The post office is the NatWest!</hs_Para>

Flint:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes such an important point. There
are so many assumptions about the way that people live their lives
today that bear no relation to our own experience, let alone that of
our constituents. In my constituency, people are 10 to 20 or more miles
away from their nearest branch. We do not hear about the 10% to 20% of
people across the UK who are in that situation. Customers in Thorne and
Bawtry will each travel 10 miles if their NatWest branch closes. As my
hon. Friend said, many of those people do not have access to a car. For
many of my constituents, getting into Doncaster town centre takes at
least two buses, and they are not necessarily running every five
minutes—unlike the service that many of my friends benefit from
in London and the big cities. The problem is simply not
recognised.</hs_Para>

all acknowledge that banking habits are changing and that branches are
less well used than they used to be. However, what banks are failing to

impact of bank closures is particularly acute in rural areas, for a
number of reasons. First, alternative services are already stretched.
The post office in Hawick, for example, is very busy and will struggle
to take on extra banking services. Secondly, connectivity in rural
areas remains a big challenge. East Berwickshire has some of the worst
internet speeds in the whole of the United Kingdom, with more than a
third of people unable to receive a decent connection. How can those
people be expected to rely on internet banking as an
alternative?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000757" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000757">High

now announce that it is going to leave. Another
issue with one of the branch closures in the borders is disabled

people with little experience of living outside the metropolitan areas
of the United Kingdom. Someone has looked at a map without any

the bank made it clear that the changes to the plans it had previously

will speak briefly about moral hazard. The reforms, in my view, have
been far too timid. We needed to break up the big banks, move away from
the universal model and introduce Glass-Steagall provisions whereby
retail and investment banking would be completely separated. 
<?notus-xml column=1721?>That is the only way to ensure that the public are protected from the
irresponsible behaviour of city speculators. Splitting retail and
investment banking activity would also help to drive forward a more
plural retail banking environment, instead of a few major banks

a more plural banking system is a key element of any strategy to
rebalance the economy of the British state on a geographical basis. The
banks, having been bailed out by the people—let us remember that
we are talking about nearly £1.3 trillion in loans, grants and
guarantees from the public—have now abandoned our communities.
More than 200 bank branches have been closed in Wales alone in the past
six years, and the closure rate in Wales is three times that of London
and the south-east of England. I am sure the same can be said of the
more rural areas in England, and indeed of Scotland and Northern
Ireland. In my constituency, all the major towns—Ammanford,
Llandeilo, Llandovery and Newcastle Emlyn—have faced bank
closures, and some have been left without any banking provision at all.

well as meaning that towns lose their status as commercial centres,
bank closures create four major problems for the communities we serve.
First, job losses in our market towns are directly associated with the
banks in question. Secondly, the loss of vital banking services can be
a huge problem in rural areas, where poor digital infrastructure often
renders internet banking redundant. In such areas bank closures
particularly affect people who continue to rely on cash and cheques for
financial transactions. Thirdly, the loss of banking services often
leads to the loss of free ATMs in our towns—a number of Members
have already referred to the problems that can create, especially for
the night-time economy. Finally, the loss of banks undermines the
financial underpinning of our local communities, despite the
far-reaching consequences of the centralisation of business services
over recent
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000776" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000776">Research
indicates that bank closures dampen lending by small and medium-sized
enterprises in their respective areas by 63%. That has a huge impact on
economic performance, with businesses deprived of access to the lending
that is so important to help them develop and maintain sustainability.
That, of course, furthers geographical wealth inequalities and creates
substantial productivity challenges in communities. As was said
earlier, we are seeing a huge market failure with dire economic and
social consequences, and policy makers must address the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000777" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000777">We
can look across the world for numerous examples of what can be done to
deal with the situation we face. In the Republic of Ireland the credit
union movement 
<?notus-xml column=1722?>has been mainstreamed to ensure that it provides vital banking services
to the citizens of that country. In the US, credit unions also provide
mainstream functions, including, critically, lending to businesses in
the communities they serve. A strong network of community banks
underpins the local economy. In Germany, strong economic performance is
underpinned by the Sparkassen and Landesbanken network, which
essentially are publicly sponsored community banks.</hs_Para>

require action on three fronts. First, we need a US-style communities
reinvestment Act to ensure that the big commercial banks have to invest
their vast resources geographically and equitably, to ensure that
businesses can obtain finance and wealth is shared evenly. Otherwise,
banks will continue to concentrate on the City of London, and on
socially useless investments that deepen sectoral and geographical
wealth inequalities in the British economy. Secondly, we need the
protection and enhancement of Post Office financial services, so that
post offices can operate as all-inclusive providers and community
banking hubs. For that to bear fruit, we must ensure that the obsession
of successive British Governments with rationalising the network is
resisted.

given that the British Government own 73% of RBS—which,
in turn, owns NatWest—surely one option would be to change the
business model and use that ready-made network. It appears, however,
that the UK Treasury’s priority is to support bank closures and
to prepare RBS for sale to City investors, but that would be an
enormous missed opportunity given that we, the public, own a large
share of that bank. Another option, put forward by my constituency
colleague, Adam Price, in the Welsh National Assembly, would be for the
Welsh Government to step into the breach by developing a network under
a Welsh public bank brand.</hs_Para>

constituency is formed of four market towns and a lot of villages, so
it will be no surprise to Members that we have seen a number of bank
closures in the past few years. In fact, there are no branches left at
all in Bradford on Avon and Corsham. Locally, a key part of the problem
has been insufficient transport infrastructure to get people into those
towns, particularly from surrounding villages such as Neston, and an
above-average ageing population.</hs_Para>

the banking industry estimates that branch visits have fallen by
roughly a third since 2011. I understand and recognise that banks are
businesses and that branch closures happen for commercial reasons.
Fundamentally, advances in technology—online and mobile
banking—have significantly reduced demand. Cheques are still the
main reason customers go into a branch, but cheque usage has declined
severely—by 13% between 2014 and 
<?notus-xml column=1723?>2015 alone. Things have changed: I remember back in the day my Mum
paying in the supermarket with a cheque and cheque guarantee card. Now
she uses Apple Pay on her iPhone!</hs_Para>

explain the decrease in demand, we must consider the purpose of banks.
For some people, as Members have suggested, banks are more than a
normal service. They are a part of the community, offering people a
personal relationship and an opportunity to chat. They can prevent
loneliness. That is why, for some, closures are not just an
inconvenience or a sting: they can actually hurt. I know that that has
been the sentiment in my constituency.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000785" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000785"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:06:22"></hs_TimeCode>That
view of banks, however, is decreasing, especially among younger
generations, hence the need to specifically help and consider the
elderly when banks close. I must note at this point, as other Members
have, that provisions are already available to reduce the impact of
bank closures. The industry’s access to banking standard,
launched in 2017, makes a commitment to provide information about
branch closures, along with options locally to continue to access
banking services. It also includes specialist assistance to customers
who need specific help. Importantly, it commits to providing a minimum
of three months’ notice of branch closures. However, I do not
think that three months is long enough for people to change their
habits or prepare themselves. I ask the Minister to call on the banks
to operate a six-month policy, which would be fairer and more adequate.
It is vital that when banks make decisions on closures they review the
transport network and infrastructure, and ensure that provision is
available so that banks are accessible in the area.</hs_Para>

banking is a perfect example of a halfway house, costing only 19% of a
physical branch. RBS group and Lloyds have built a large network of
mobile banks across the country, and HSBC has just started to do the
same. They help in areas where there is no accessible alternative

with me that the case for such a trial is just as valid in Bradford on
Avon. I am sure the Minister, as a local Wiltshire MP, also
agrees.</hs_Para>

to the impact of bank branch closures, each case is different in every
circumstance. When severe, it can suggest, alongside closure, a lack of
investment in training and support for older and vulnerable people.
That is why I reiterate that a three-month notice period is not long
enough. It takes time to build some people’s 
<?notus-xml column=1724?>confidence in the security of digital banking. Alongside Lloyds bank and
Barclays, I have run three fraud workshops, which were heavily
attended, particularly by the elderly community. Support to vulnerable
residents and the elderly is crucial. It is important to remember that
about 4 million people—mainly the elderly—are not online
at all. However, we must not write off older people as incapable of
using the internet. We must support and manage them, and give them the
tools and skills to make progress. More than 600,000 people aged over
80 already have online banking. They put me to shame, as I joined only
last year.</hs_Para>

stumbling block to digital banking can be deprivation, which can render
people unable to own a computer or a smartphone. Mobile blackspots and
patchy internet services are both common in the villages in my
constituency. Banks should ensure that an alternative option is
accessible, such as mobile banking or sufficient public transparent to
the nearest branch, and I again make the point that Bradford on Avon
really needs mobile banking.</hs_Para>

are not the answer, but they are part of the solution and can play an
essential role. Our post offices have been struggling for years, but
incorporating banking into their services is proving to increase their
footfall and helping to engage people in their services again. The Post
Office currently offers basic banking services to many bank customers
and is expanding that to business customers. As has been noted,
awareness is the key problem, but it is also about changing
consumers’ habits. I was pleased that at the autumn Budget of
2017, the Treasury wrote to the Post Office and UK Finance to stress
the importance of raising public awareness. I would like to hear the
result of that from the Minister.</hs_Para>

conclusion, it is important that we do not resist technology, but that
we accept and embrace change to enable progress, grow our economy and
compete on the international stage. However, I want to be realistic. I
believe that it is inevitable that all branches will eventually close.
The supply of them has reduced by 60% in my lifetime, so I think that
we should encourage a sustainable hub model to emerge—a one-stop
shop—where post office and banking facilities can be offered, as
well as debt advice and potentially even a citizens advice bureau. That
will help to safeguard our high streets. The transition period is so
important, along with the support available. Banks need to lead the way
in training and supporting people who are currently unable to support
themselves through their digital skills. We must also encourage the
roll-out of mobile banking.</hs_Para>

for Hazel Grove (Mr Wragg) on securing the debate. I would like to
speak about Ramsbottom, which is frequently in the top-10 lists of best
places to live and visit. Of the two market towns that I am proud to

banks, and banks generally, bring tradespeople to the town. They
increase footfall and help to determine a town’s future
prospects. Paying in, cashing up, small impulse buys, floats, cash-only

part of business life and life and living in
Ramsbottom.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000797" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000797">However,
first Barclays then NatWest closed, and now Royal Bank of Scotland is
reducing its opening hours, with visitors to Rammy, and customers
reducing with them. A bank nearby is likely to determine the opening
hours of any retail operation or business, as the proprietor will need
to factor in the bank’s closing time with that of their business
and the leaving time of their staff. It will be one of the things that
a business proprietor considers in determining where to set up in the
first place, and if a local authority is struggling to attract new
shops, it will understandably opt for another eatery for the night-time
economy or reach for a high-street name, thus risking diluting the
independent offer of a town like ours, which is, in its first instance,
the fundamental nature of the place and why visitors come at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000798" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000798">It
is all tied in to this proud community—one that has pulled
together at a time of mourning recently, or a time of great
testing—the Boxing day floods two years ago. There is always
something fun to do and to see, whether at the chocolate festival,
black pudding throwing competition—<I>[Interruption.]</I> It is

the problems cannot all be laid at the door of the banks, but they are
a considerable part of the cumulative issues facing this community,
including business rates, public transport links drying up, and less
disposable income after making ends meet. It is the independent nature
of Ramsbottom that gives it its zeal. These are our entrepreneurs, who
are not denying the march of progress with broadband, with cash
alternatives and online shopping; they are, as I am, rightly defending
their modern but traditional offer. The butcher, the baker, the
dressmaker, the art gallery, the coffee lounge, craft shops, pet shops,
micro-breweries, chocolate factory and specialist food stores,
family-run restaurants as well as charity shops, have all spoken to me
of the impact on them of the drying up of available banking and a local
bank.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000800" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000800">The

closing, here are some possible solutions. The Government should
sponsor more challenger banks that operate at break even or not for
profit. We should consider extending the role and mandate of credit
unions. Labour’s proposed regional investment banks would ensure
that community banking has a primary role in the service offer, and the
Government should adopt that principle immediately. There should be
rewards in the form of tax incentives for community banking operations
when the “profit and loss” or “balance

even.</hs_Para>

matter is of specific interest to me. Early in December, Lloyds bank
announced the closure of three branches in the Waveney Valley area of
north Suffolk: in Bungay, in my constituency, and in Halesworth and
Southwold in the constituency of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:21:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey). I should declare an
interest at this point, because I am both a personal and a business
customer of the Halesworth branch.
<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>Shortly after
the Lloyds announcement, NatWest announced the closure of its branch in
Beccles, which is also in my constituency.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000818" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000818"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:21:40"></hs_TimeCode>My
main concern is that, if Lloyds proceeds with the closure of its Bungay
branch, there will be no bank left in the town, and I believe that we
need policies to prevent that from happening. Some may say that I am a
Luddite and that we cannot hold back the inevitable march of the
internet and modernisation, but what concerns me is that some banks are
closing branches in an indiscriminate, non-strategic way that will have
an adverse impact on the elderly, the disabled, those without their own
transport, small businesses, and the economies of the towns and
hinterlands that will be left with no bank standing.
<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>In the last two
years, Barclays and Norwich and Peterborough building society have
closed their branches in Bungay. If Lloyds proceeds with its branch
closure in May, there will be no bank left in the town. That has upset
many people who transferred their accounts to Lloyds following the
previous closures, and it will have a particularly negative impact on
the elderly and disabled and on small businesses.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000819" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000819"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:22:50"></hs_TimeCode>I
have three specific concerns. First, if Lloyds proceeds with its
closure, there will be no cashpoint machine with 24/7 access in the
town centre. Bungay has three street fairs a year, which bring a
significant amount of business into the town. Last Christmas an
estimated 1,200 to 1,500 people came along, and there were long queues
at the Lloyds cashpoint. Many of the traders who go to the street fairs
only handle cash, and there is a real worry that, if it is not
available locally, the fairs—which add so much to the vibrancy
of the town—will suffer.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000820" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000820"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:23:32"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
it is important to emphasise that many businesses, both in the towns
and in the countryside, still use cash and cheques. The lack of
immediate access to cash and deposit points will, at least in the short
term, cause considerable inconvenience and added expense. On the basis
of my experience as a partner in a local family farm, I know that for
several farmers the easiest way to handle payments from the grain
merchant is still via cheques, and that quite often the rents paid by
small businesses for farm buildings and workshops are still paid in
cash. It should also be borne in mind that the change to internet
banking in rural areas will require considerable improvement in
broadband connectivity, an issue about which we have heard
throughout the debate.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=1728?><hs_Para UID="18020841000821" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000821"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:24:26"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly,
the lack of a bank in Bungay will affect the town’s ability to
draw in customers from the surrounding area. Lloyds is redirecting its
customers to its Beccles branch. That may mean that people who came
into Bungay once a week to go to the bank, to do their shopping and to
have a coffee or a meal may now do all that in Beccles. I met Lloyds
representatives on 4 December, when I put those points to them. I asked
them to reconsider their decision to close the Bungay branch. It is
disappointing that I have not yet had a response from them, although I
hope that that means they are giving the matter serious
consideration.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000822" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000822">With regard
to NatWest’s closure in Beccles, I had a meeting with the
bank’s representatives last month. I am disappointed with their
decision, but they took me in some detail through why they reached the
decision to close the branch and how they are now engaging with their
customers. They are prepared to work with the local community. As well
as a mobile bank and closer working with the post office, they have
plans for a community banker who will have a base in the town at set
days during the week, possibly in the library and the town
hall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000823" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000823">I
have mentioned that the closure of Lloyds in Bungay would result in
there being no ATM accessible 24/7. With this in mind it is necessary
to ensure that there remains a good network of cashpoints across rural
Britain, where consumers and small businesses use cash to a greater
extent than in urban areas. I thus urge the Government to support the
Which? and Federation of Small Businesses campaign to get the Payment
Systems Regulator to ensure suitable measures are in place to guarantee
that consumers can easily access their money without charge.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000824" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000824">It is
important that measures are introduced that can help to avoid a
situation where towns are left without a single bank. That could be
done in a variety of ways, in particular by building on the post office
network, which generally has a better rural reach than that of high
street banks. The policies put in place, first by the coalition
Government and then the current Government, have been successful in
making the post office network more resilient.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020841000825" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000825">In Bungay,
the post office is in the newsagent and there is a drawback of lack of
space. In towns at risk of having no bank, consideration should be
given to providing additional funding to put in place a more
substantial post office branch. Ultimately, I would look for this to be
funded by the banks. Alternative options that could be considered are
mutual societies or pop-up banks, where the high street banks join
together to sustain a presence in the
town.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020841000826" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000826">Bungay
was a pioneer of provincial banking, with Gurney’s, a precursor
of Barclays, opening one of its first branches in the town in 1808.

happen.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="18020841000894" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020841000894"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:27:55"></hs_TimeCode>3.27

in the debate reference was made to post offices. Having worked with
local businesses and post offices in my constituency, I welcome any
improvements where they have been made. I also welcome the work that
the Treasury has done on standardisation, because we are no longer in
the daft position where some things work for some banks, and other
things work for other banks. There are post office branches where that
works absolutely magnificently, but in others it simply does not work.
If someone comes into a post office to buy a packet of crisps, and then
someone else buys a bar of chocolate, but the person working there has
to deal with a banking transaction in the middle of that, that is not a
sustainable solution.</hs_Para>

looking to develop post offices in that way, that might be one exciting
option to consider around the country. I know for a fact that post

Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) spoke about some
commercially sensitive information that she was not allowed to have. I,
too, have asked for commercially sensitive information, such as how
many people had accounts at the branch, and clearly the bank was unable
to tell me. Better still, I asked how many people on a typical week
went in with queries. I was told something earth-shattering: that
queries might not really be queries. I asked what that meant. I was
told that, if someone goes into a bank, stands at the counter and asks
a question, that might not be a query. I made the point that, for the
customer asking the question, it very much was a query. I was told
that, if there was no formal transaction, it was not a query. It is a

we do about cashpoints and ATMs is of utmost seriousness. There are
currently some 70,000 in the country, the bulk of which are free to

concern. His point was that, if the ATM companies were not going to
deal with the problem, this House needed to look at it, because people
in rural communities and those on low incomes would be affected the
most. As far as I can see, one problem with cashpoints is that the 38
or so banks and the like that are part of the ATM network are having a
little scrap with each other. As they knock metaphorical spots off each
other, each deciding that they are all paying too much, it is the

the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr Wragg) on securing this debate.
Technology has been used to modernise the banking sector for decades
and, as an industry, banking has seized the opportunity to use
technology mostly to improve the customer experience wherever possible.
In the ’90s, I worked as a technology procurement manager for a
bank when we were upgrading branch infrastructure. Thinking back, the
introduction of the ATM network was one of the first steps away from
personalised, face-to-face banking, but what would we do without them?
We cannot do without them, and I could not agree more with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:39:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Clwyd South about how important it is, as we face changes in the
banking industry, that the ATM network and free access to it is
preserved throughout the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000003">The
revolution in FinTech has forced another change in the banking model,
and our banks no longer collect the income of merchants and disburse
the cash to individuals. Our behavioural patterns have changed with
technology. In 1988 we had more than 20,000 bank branches in the UK,
and 25% of adults were paid in cash. In many respects, cash has had its
heyday. Now accounting for less than 50% of transactions, we saw an 11%
decline between 2015 and 2016 alone. Cash may still be king, but its
crown is
slipping.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000004">That
trend is set to continue. Already 6% of the population rarely use cash.
Young people, in particular, prefer digital payment methods such as
card, online and mobile banking. The model of branch banking as a
conduit for cash movements therefore needs to change to ensure that
banks remain commercially
viable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000005">The
speed of change has surprised many communities, with the uptake of
digital banking being relatively recent, and it is important
that adequate notice is given when changes are made to local banking
services. In 2012 at least one of our major banks had no mobile users
at all, but today there are more logins a day on mobile banking than
via the web. Meanwhile, the average branch bank customer goes to the
bank every two or three
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000006">Branch
closures throughout the nation are predominantly a response to
declining demand. In my constituency, Barclays closed its branch in
East Wittering citing a 
<?notus-xml column=1732?>10% fall in transactions at the branch in a single
year. However, Barclays has identified 80 customers who exclusively
used the branch for their banking needs. Those people need alternative
provision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000007">When
a branch closes, it is important that the it gets in touch to advise
customers of all the services that are available online, via telephone

services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000008">Like
everybody else in this discussion,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:41:47"></hs_TimeCode> am concerned
that there is an increased risk of financial exclusion due to either a
lack of digital know-how or a lack of access to the technology.
Personal banking is something that many people, especially older
members of our society, greatly value, and in many cases the
alternatives are not
suitable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000009">We<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:42:34"></hs_TimeCode>
need to ensure those customers know that the Post Office offers branch
banking services for all major high street banks and can facilitate all
the things that people do in a bank, including traditional cash and
cheque services. That is a good alternative, as more than 98% of the
population live within three miles of one of our 11,600 post offices
nationwide, which makes it Europe’s biggest retail
network.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000010">The
structure of community services is changing, with our traditional high
street names consolidating into shared services. Becoming a community
hub is important. The Post Office has managed that well in Chichester
and is collaborating with retailers such as corner shops and book
shops. That is a win-win for sustainability. Many Members will have
been involved in debates about post office closures. We need to make
sure that the network of face-to-face branch services is secured in
some way, and post offices are a good
alternative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000011">It
is important that such services are well designed, as other Members
have mentioned. I recently visited the new Chichester post office,
which is co-located with Sussex Stationers and British Bookshops. There
are seats available for those who cannot stand in a queue for long, and
staff are on hand to assist people who are using self-service kiosks or
who are waiting for the cashier. Needed privacy is provided. The
service is similar to that provided by the old bank branches That is
the right model, but these new post offices need to be well designed,
and perhaps more could be done to promote best practice in
design.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000012">The
Government have made significant strides in improving both mobile and
broadband coverage, with 95% of households now able to get superfast
broadband. Alas, in rural areas such as my constituency, many people
still suffer from areas of poor connectivity, with some areas of my
constituency ranking in the worst 10% in the country. As we
increasingly rely on digital banking services, blanket connectivity is
becoming increasingly important. We must continue our investment in
digital connectivity to mitigate the impact of branch closures and to
allow people to utilise the technology of today. It is clear though
that for some of the older generation, the digital era will already
have passed them by. Expecting them to bank digitally is simply not
realistic and in cases such as these, the post office must be
advertised as the new place for local face-to-face banking. 
<?notus-xml column=1733?>I am concerned that banks might be reticent to
advertise post office banking as they may compete in some other
areas.</hs_Para>

businesses must adapt to stay ahead of the game and the major banks are
under increasing pressure to modernise their services, with new
entrants disrupting banking models for businesses and individuals.
FinTech firms are creating new and efficient financial platforms,
offering lower prices to consumers for financial transactions. To keep
up, our major banks have to move to a more customer-centric and digital
model of working.</hs_Para>

the banking sector have revolutionised how we do business
and how we handle personal finances and, overall, I believe that that
has been to the benefit of society. The advent of the microchip, the
internet and mobile services have fundamentally altered many of our
industries, and banking is no different. Banking practices have had to
change to remain commercially viable and banks have had to invest in
digital banking platforms, which has made life easier for most of us,
but of course we must take care of those who are not willing or able
use the services. These individuals must be informed of the other
service providers, such as the post offices, and banks that are closing
branches have a moral obligation to do

is to close, and Barclays is to close its branch in Sedgefield village.
This recent round of closures will deprive every community in my
constituency of a bank branch except Newton Aycliffe, which will still
have a Halifax, a Barclays and a TSB. It is the biggest town in the
constituency, with about 30,000 people living there. The local post
office still operates in these communities and offers banking
facilities, but it is hardly the place to discuss banking issues such
as mortgages or loans. Sedgefield is a rural constituency, with up to
40 towns, villages and hamlets over 150 square miles. The bus network

banking is now done online, on a mobile app, or on the
telephone, but there are still those in our communities who need to be
able to walk into their local bank branch because they are not online
or do not have access to a telephone or mobile, especially the elderly.
I know that the banks that are closing branches in my constituency say
that they recognise those concerns. NatWest, for example, has a network
of community bankers—I believe the number is 1,000—around
the country who will be deployed to reach out to and support vulnerable
customers when a branch is closed.</hs_Para>

have pointed out to me that how people do their banking has changed
radically over the past few years. NatWest told me that the number of
people using its branch network has fallen by 40% since 2014. 
<?notus-xml column=1734?>In the same period, mobile transactions have
increased by 73% and, in the first half of 2017, 1.1 billion mobile and
online transactions were carried out by the bank’s customers.
Since 2012, in the two NatWest branches in my constituency, 88% of the
customers in Ferryhill and 89% of the customers in Newton Aycliffe have
banked in other ways. Transactions at the Ferryhill branch have fallen
by 30% and at Newton Aycliffe the figure was 34%. The number of
customers using both branches has fallen to between 60 and 100 a week,
although whenever I speak to customers who use the branches they always
say that there are queues and that they are busy. The reality for
customers seems to be completely different from the statistics revealed
by the branch. It is a similar story with Santander in Newton Aycliffe.
Santander says that 91% of customers use other means of banking besides
walking into the local branch. Some 45% use other Santander branches
and 40% use their mobiles to do online

France than elsewhere—Société
Générale has announced the closure of 20% of its branch
network by 2020. That bank is going to close one in five branches.
However, the French bank branch network is still extensive, with six
branches per 10,000 head of population, which I believe is the highest
proportion in the EU. In
Spain<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:52:55"></hs_TimeCode>, 10,000
branches were closed between 2012 and 2016. Banking is changing, driven
by technology that is obviously convenient to the vast majority of
customers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000025">I
would like the Minister to address two areas of concern. First, what
more can the Government do and what work are they undertaking with the
financial sector to encourage banks to look after their vulnerable
customers so that they are not left behind? There is also a wider
concern. Rural areas, such as County Durham, are seeing the destruction
of rural bus services and there are issues with whether broadband
provision is sufficient to allow customers to access the internet and
therefore access online banking in the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000026">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:53:52"></hs_TimeCode>,
the closure of bank branches highlights a key problem that faces our
town centres. For example, the future of Newton Aycliffe town centre
has been controversial for many years. Although Freshwater, the
shopping centre’s owner, has invested in the centre and won
awards for its efforts, the closure of two bank branches will only add
to the number of already vacant shops. This is not a story reserved for
Newton Aycliffe; it is true of town centres throughout the country.
Town centres need to be more leisure-focused, with bars, restaurants
and coffee shops, as retail moves online, where people are more likely
to shop—with Amazon being a case in point. As a consequence, we
see many retailers quitting jobs and issuing profit warnings. I make
this request to the banking sector: look at how you can change your
offer on the high street; look at how you can make the physical bank
presence more affordable and more accessible; and look at whether there
is a way to merge banking with leisure, such as, for example, placing
bank branches within a café.</hs_Para>

closure of banks does not happen in isolation. It affects vulnerable
people, it affects our town centres and it affects our communities and
their way of life. The banks must remember that, although there is a
trend with new technology towards online banking, other people can be
left behind; and there is a life that is offline as well as online. All
I ask is for the banks to think creatively, because they, too, have a
social obligation to their customers, not just to their bottom
line.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2018-02-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2017_2019/DailyParts/2018_02_08_PT_1/6B9EBB93601155758F5FE1371CBD8038EC9DB6E5" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 February 2018">Thursday

Mackinlay</B> (South Thanet) (Con):</Member> We have had a debate of
extreme unity, between parties, between regions and between countries.
It is fair to say that every MP in the House is concerned about the
rapid closure of the banking network. I particularly wish to salute

feels like we are seeing a rapid change in high street banking, at a
rate that I have never seen before. The reason for that is
probably to do with us—the consumer. We have gone down the route
that the banks have encouraged: taking the contactless route and using
mobile and internet banking. We no longer use cheques for our
transactions, because, first, we cannot find our cheque book, and
secondly, we have to find an envelope and a stamp.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Gillian Keegan) said
very clearly, the volume of cash transactions in society is now below
50%. Even though we have the advance of the cashless society—I

most transactions can be appropriately taxed—it will be a very

are a number of cash businesses; every constituency has them. My fear
is that, when banking facilities move further and further away from
those businesses, the amount of cash that is held in their premises and
the homes of their owners, and perhaps in their safes, will become
bigger and bigger, and with that will come security risks. There are
security risks for the staff who are responsible for taking that cash
to a bank that is increasing in size and further
away.<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:57:45"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

one-day festivals. They generate cash on that day, but, unlike
businesses, which may be able to mitigate some of the problems, they
may have volunteers who never have done anything like it before. That
is a huge issue. Unfortunately, the post office will take cash deposits

Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) said very
clearly that, when charities hold grand county fairs, there may be
temporary traders who do not have contactless facilities and will not

business. There are also clubs and societies that rely on cash and
cheques for the small transactions among
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000034">I
recall, not that long ago—I do not want to single out NatWest
for any particular criticism—an advert that said, “We are
open all the time. We are keeping our branches.” It was
criticising its competitors, saying, “Ah, look, our competitor
banks have made your bank into a new trendy wine bar.” I am
afraid that we are seeing far too many of those across the country. I
recall very clearly that my first bank account was at Lloyds
33 years ago. That branch, which had been there for
50 years or more, is now a quite nice Cypriot restaurant.

banking under any circumstances, because it is not uncommon for him to
say to me, “Oh, I’ve had an email from Santander and I
don’t even bank with Santander.” That is exactly the
point. Many of us here, particularly those who are younger than me, are
very internet-savvy and would recognise a scam banking email, but many

“fight”, I mean trying to stop it, not physically
fighting it. We have had meetings with Ulster Bank officials and come
up with some ideas, not on how to stop the closure, because we cannot
do that, but on how to make it easier. This seems to be the latest
banking fad: close the smaller branches, centralise everything, and it
does not matter about the lack of customer services. What matters is
how much profit the banks can get for their shareholders. That should

I met the officials from Ulster Bank for an open and frank discussion

who are making decisions. 
<?notus-xml column=1739?>That was despite the fact that we had outlined the particular need for
the branch to remain, given the needs of the rural community and those
who are already isolated. In Kircubbin village, farmers and fishermen
had banked at Ulster Bank for umpteen years. People from businesses in
the village had strolled down to their bank, because it was within
walking distance. We had an elderly population who looked on the bank
as more than a bank, because they had a relationship with the people in
it as well. Those things were lost. Now we have a credit union that has
started up. I hope that it can fill some of the vacancy, but it cannot

have real concern that these decisions are made by big banks that look
only at the profit of the bank, not profit across the Province, and
that they are not rural-proofing. Rural-proofing has to be part of the
decision making process. Hopefully the Minister will give us some idea
of whether, in his discussions with the bank, he has been able to raise
the issue of rural-proofing and how it affects rural
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000050">I
believe that customers in Kircubbin who pay the same charges as
customers in Belfast should receive a similar service. That is clearly
not the case. It has once again come to pass that living in the country

one of us remembers our introduction to a bank. I remember well the
first loan I took out from the bank. I will not go into detail, but the
bank manager was most accommodating. To be truthful, the way we got our
loan would never happen today. It was done very quickly, with the
knowledge of me, and probably of my parents and their solid banking
over some 30 or 40
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000052">I
put forward the case for Kircubbin, and particularly the needs of the
fishermen and farmers in the area, and asked what
would be offered to help those valued customers. I must say,
I am still disappointed and annoyed. I was somewhat grateful that as
opposed to walking away, as many banks have done with a “Too
bad, so sad” attitude, the bank has committed to a leave-behind
service that will take the form of a one-day-a-week community banker
who will work from an office space or business in the town to help with
one-on-one
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0003.htm#18020845000053">We

bank has also been allowing people to bank in the post office for basic
lodgements, withdrawals and balance checks. In the six-month run-down
to the closure of the bank, there was a dedicated staff member who
helped people to better understand and use the online banking system.
There were also numerous tutorials available to users, and the bank
made its community officer available to groups such as fishermen or

system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000055">I
have watched people go into a bank and have someone explain how the
online service works, but I can tell you that as soon as they walked
out of that bank,

we did not get the outcome I had hoped for, there is at least a clear

seems like too many banks are closing, leaving customers who are not
confident with online banking with no option other than to bank in that
way. The problem I have with online banking is that it does not suit
everyone, and many people need an alternative. I have seen customer
services representatives talking to customers about online banking, and
it is clear to me that they are unhappy and unsure how it
works.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000058">I
personally like the paper trail of banking. I well remember when my
mother took me down at the age of 16 to open my bank account with the
Danske Bank. She gave me £20 to start it, which was a fortune in
those days. Along with the £26 that I had saved for
five or six years, I had £46. I was able to buy a Mini car for
£45. That gives an idea of how far back it was. We thought we
were rich, and we were, because I got my first car. I have been with
that bank ever

do not bank online. Indeed, I could not bank online with my limited
computer skills. I do not believe that the bank should force this on
those who are not internet-savvy and who leave themselves open to being
victims of fraud, as they do not know how to protect themselves. That
is another thing we must remember. As others have said, there are so
many scams today, with people phoning up and saying, “I’m
from the bank. Give me your details.” The elderly feel
vulnerable, and we need to protect them. I have a particular concern
about that, especially in my constituency. We do not let children
internet-bank because we attempt to protect their interests, and yet
they are more computer-savvy than a 65-year-old retired fisherman who
we try to force this new way

speak with a degree of nostalgia and affection for community banking,
given that I grew up around community banks. My mum has worked in
retail banking for her whole career, and I remember vividly as a kid
being taken down into the vaults of the Bank of Scotland in Charing
Cross, where my mum worked. I also remember opening my Squirrel saver
account at the Bank of Scotland, and my little plastic Bank of Scotland

speak with great affection about community banks, but I also know how
important they are, particularly for elderly customers and vulnerable
people in the community. They develop a very close and affectionate
relationship with the staff, who know them very well, understand their
needs and are able to accommodate them. It is a form of personal
interaction that builds affectionate relationships and a long-term
engagement with banks, and those relationships are hugely valuable for
the banks. I would have hoped that more banks recognised how important
such personal interaction is for communities —it is
vital—and how it contributes to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000068">It<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T16:17:49"></hs_TimeCode>
is a shame to think that that bank in Charing Cross is now a Starbucks.
That shows that this is a long-term process of withdrawal from
communities, and we must challenge it because our communities are
approaching a real cliff edge. My worry is that the programme of bank
closures that we have observed, particularly in recent years, appears
to target the poorest communities in our society disproportionately.
Well over 1,000 branches have closed in the past two years
alone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000069">In<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T16:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>
my constituency of Glasgow North East, where unemployment is twice the
national average—I would add that it has had the lowest turnout

level of disengagement of many people—we have had the closure of
the RBS branches in Possilpark, one of the poorest

branch on Springburn Way, next to the shopping centre, I saw a branch
of BrightHouse doing good business—it was doing a roaring trade.
BrightHouse is a rapacious organisation that fleeces the poorest
communities in our society by, I would argue, mis-selling consumer
goods at outrageous rates of interest. That is also something we should

challenged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000071"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T16:15:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Ged Killen" ContributionType="Start Intervention" HRSContentId="{10AFD3EB-633A-463B-9B89-B4C5216549F9}" PimsId="6235" UID="18020845000202" xid="1487" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000202">Ged

Although the recent stay of execution for 10 branches in rural areas of
Scotland is welcome, these are some of the wealthiest communities in

Sweeney:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is correct, and that is one thing
we do not see—I have tried to piece together the evidence, but
it is not nationally recorded. What is the
density of banking operations in the poorest communities in our
society? Data is not gathered on that issue. Possilpark and Springburn
fall into the most deprived decile on the Scottish index of multiple
deprivation, including for employment, health, education and housing.
That seems to be the case for a lot of areas with branch closures,
certainly in the Glasgow area, and it would be interesting if the
Government could oblige banks to provide the data as a matter of
national standards. By contrast, in the wealthiest parts of the
city—I took the example of Byres Road, which is arguably the
wealthiest postcode in Glasgow—every major bank is represented.
Banks seem to be withdrawing from the poorest communities while
maintaining their services in the richest parts of the city, and if
that is extrapolated across the UK, it paints a dismal
picture.</hs_Para>

argued that bank closures are a reality of technological change because
more people are using online banking services. In reality, however, 2
million Scots do not use online banking, and they are
disproportionately older people who are not familiar with the change in
technology. We must be realistic about the rate of change and how
practical it is, so as to reduce the harm caused to society and prevent
the generational dislocation that is evidently occurring. More than one
third of people who use the services of Citizens Advice Scotland have
no or limited internet access. How will they access finance and banking
if the major commercial banks disinvest in their local communities?

for me is the ATM. In 2016, the Scot James Goodfellow was inducted into
the Scottish

first ATM in 1966. He did that in response to the desire by the major
commercial clearing banks to close on Saturday mornings. People were
trying to find a technological way to accommodate that desire, and that
is how the ATM came into being and why it is so ubiquitous on our high
streets today. We must harness technological change for the public
good, not simply use it as a cop-out or an excuse to ridiculously
disinvest from our communities at an inappropriate rate. We in the

good; we cannot leave the banks to be judge and jury about the way that
such change should occur.</hs_Para>

that closures are not just driven by technological change, and we must
consider the banking sector in the UK. Five of the major commercial

centralised systems in the world. As Adam Smith recognised,
profit-seeking behaviour runs contrary to the common good and the
creation of national wealth—we should always remember that

400 local savings banks, known as Sparkassen, 1,000
co-operative run banks, and 300 private commercial banks, and that

Goodfellow made his speech while being inducted into the Engineering
Hall of Fame, he said that the greatest regret of his career was that
ATMs were patented and invented in this country, yet they are not built

industrial innovation, and our industrial strategy is symptomatic of
our banking sector. We do not finance industrial growth because we are
seeking high-risk, high-return profit in the City; we are not investing

Germany have the largest manufacturing sector in Europe, and one of the

previously. The key innovation of the Act, introduced under the Carter
Administration, was to combat discrimination and provide access to
credit for low and moderate income communities. If we reflect on the
nature of bank closures in the UK, it is highly likely that they
disproportionately affect the poorest communities. In the United
States, that was known as “redlining”: banks
essentially blacklisted communities they thought not worthy of

sector is worth billions of dollars and it competes on an equal footing
with commercial banks. Santander’s operations in the United
States contrast with its operations in the UK: a £11 billion
five-year commitment to support community benefits. An increase of 50%

We are all very concerned. We have had the announcement of yet more
bank closures by RBS, with a further 62 branches closing in
Scotland. Ten have been reprieved for the moment, following
negotiations with the Scottish National party leadership. I agree that

that the closures have given rise to. Its public image lies in tatters,
but it has opened the door an inch to reprieve some branches. I and SNP
activists, who have been out every weekend, on Saturdays and Sundays,
since after Christmas collecting parliamentary petition signatures to
save our banks—having already collected thousands of
signatures—now propose to run at the door that has been slightly
opened and kick it open wide to save our branches. We will not give up

financial services, so they do indeed have the authority to call a

banks, stakeholders and the UK and Scottish Governments consider how

clear: the bank closures mean that the affected communities no longer
have access to day-to-day essential banking services. They mean that my
constituents in Kilbirnie must undertake a round trip of 18.8 miles to
access their new so-called “local” bank, with most
relying on public transport to do so. They mean that RBS customers in
Saltcoats are being directed to the next RBS, which is a round trip of
12.8 miles, and Kilwinning customers are being asked to undertake a
round trip of 6.8 miles to visit their new “local”
branch.</hs_Para>

about the impact on accessibility was well made. Members spoke about
the impact on individuals and communities. As the Social Market
Foundation points out, 11% of the population rely completely on high
street bank branches, and that is typically the older and poorer parts
of our communities. This is an example of financial exclusion it is a
real problem throughout the country. Only 30% of the over-65 population
use online banking. That is of particular importance in constituencies
such as mine, which is in the top 20 of constituencies for people aged
over 65. That is a real cause for concern, to which I shall return
later, with examples from my

Banking Association survey found that 58% of people surveyed stated
that access to a branch—using a branch—was important to
them, and 57% believed that face-to-face relationships with their bank
were important. Those figures go up for businesses: for SMEs, the
figures are that 68% believe that a branch is important and that 66%
find that face-to-face banking is important. Therefore, the impact of
branch closures is felt by individuals in their personal banking and
for business banking, with particular impacts on our high
streets—our communities. The Federation of Small Businesses

to do the banking that they

the time come to put public good ahead of short-term profit? The
challenger banks—such as Metro, which is open seven days a week,
and the Bank of Dave, which results from the entrepreneurial approach
taken by Dave Fishwick in Burnley—have demonstrated that 
<?notus-xml column=1749?>it is possible to make a success of a bank branch.
Is it time for banks and financial services to be seen as a
utility, an essential public service that delivers for
customers—for high streets, communities and small businesses? We
regulate the financial services sector now, and I can tell the Minister
that if the Government will not add to that regulation by addressing
this issue, a Labour Government certainly will. We will ensure that no

must intervene so that the banks work for us. As a number of right hon.
and hon. Members have pointed out, the banking access protocol has not
delivered. There is an impact on communities, travel, public transport,
the environment, economies and businesses from lowering footfall, and
there is lower lending in places without bank branches. Some 10% of
households do not have the internet, and only 9% of small firms
approached their banks in 2016 for finance. All of these things are
examples of why the banking system is not delivering.</hs_Para>

about what is needed today. Face-to-face banking for business and

we can be successful. The voluntary approach has not worked, and the

many Members in our debate. Change, which in this case is driven by the
unrivalled speed of innovation in the financial services sector, is not
easy to remedy. How many of us in this House regularly use our local
branch, and how many of us, like me and others, manage our finances

the Member for Chippenham to extend that period. They have a
responsibility as soon as operationally ready, and I note that RBS gave
six months’ notice. Secondly, banks will work with customers
after the announcement has been made to ensure that they 
<?notus-xml column=1751?>know how and where they can continue to bank.
Thirdly—this is vital—banks are required to identify
vulnerable customers and ensure that they receive all the help they
need. That could mean helping customers get online for the first time,
or it could mean showing them the facilities at the local post office,
or ensuring that they have access to a mobile branch, a telephone
banking service or a local, free-to-use ATM. Obviously, every bank will
take a different approach, but the principle of the standard is that
the outcome for customers will be the same.</hs_Para>

have made great strides in bolstering the over-the-counter banking
services available at post offices, and an extra £370 million to
support that work was announced in December. UK banks and
building societies reached a new commercial agreement with the Post
Office that has set the standard for the banking services available in
post offices, ensuring a uniform level across the 11,600 branches.
Those services can include the ability to check a balance, to withdraw
and deposit cash using a debit card, to use chip and pin or pre-printed
paying-in slips, and to deposit cheques. There is an ad hoc cash

wherever they live, can access the banking services they need. This
Government have taken measures to maintain access to vital banking
services and to ensure that banks support communities across the UK
when their local branches close. Banks will need to continue

this debate to enlist the Minister’s help in getting North East
Hertfordshire up to speed with superfast broadband. My constituency

broadband speeds, but there are also many small rural hamlets that do
not yet have superfast
broadband.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000150">North
East Hertfordshire is, geographically, by far the largest constituency
in Hertfordshire, yet we have a far lower level of superfast broadband
coverage than other parts of the county. I ask the Minister to help me
push coverage in my constituency up to the Hertfordshire average of 95%
this year, and then to complete the job of reaching the target of close
to 99% in
2019.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000151">I
have been pressing hard on this, and in the last year, according to the
House of Commons Library, coverage in my constituency has gone up from
67% to 77%, but that is far from good enough. We need sustained efforts
from Ministers, Openreach and Hertfordshire County Council’s
delivery organisation, Connected Counties, to push the figure higher
and
quicker.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000152">In

the<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T17:01:24"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport; the managing director of
Openreach, Mr Steve Haines; and the previous and present leaders of

ago it was agreed by the Government and this House that the Government
would have to fund the roll-out of superfast broadband in
non-commercially viable areas such as my local hamlets. Indeed, I was

involved. I remember lobbying Secretaries of State, including my right

my part in securing that funding, it has been disappointing and
frustrating to watch the lack of progress in connecting up my rural
areas. Although successive Ministers have assured me that the county as
a whole has achieved first 92% and then 95% coverage, it has only
recently been acknowledged that the coverage in my area has edged up at
a snail’s pace to the current 84%. It is galling for my
constituents to learn that ultrafast broadband is being piloted in
Bishop’s Stortford when they are languishing with no coverage or
with a few crumbs, such as 0.8 megabits per second. To give an example,
61% of the village of Little Hadham, which is three miles from
Bishop’s Stortford, is receiving under 10 megabits per
second.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000155">It
should not be forgotten that this is not a remote area. Some of the
places with the worst coverage, such as those in the Hertford Rural
South ward, are less than 20 miles from London. Many people now work
from home for some of the week, which is encouraged for 
<?notus-xml column=1755?>London workers to take the strain off the transport system. My
constituents, particularly those with caring responsibilities, would
like the opportunity to work from home, but they cannot do it without
broadband.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000156">There
is also a high number of small businesses in those areas, many
encouraged by the offer of office space in former farm buildings.
Diversification on farms is encouraged by our local councils and by the
Government. To give another example, the villages of Weston and Sandon
lie close to Stevenage. Stevenage has download speeds of close to 70
megabits per second, whereas 83% of Weston and Sandon is
unable even to receive 10 megabits per
second.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000157">I
am grateful to the Which? organisation for pointing out to me that
recent data from Ofcom showed that the average download speed in North
East Hertfordshire is 47.8 megabits per second, whereas
neighbouring constituencies are at the 60 megabits per second mark.
However, Which? analysis of speed tests found that the median download
speed in North East Hertfordshire is only 13.9 megabits per second and
a quarter of speeds recorded were less than 6.8
Mbps.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000158">I
would like to offer the Minister my analysis of the problems in the
roll-out process. Connected Counties has operated with Openreach to
identify areas that might not be commercially viable, with Connected
Counties then offering Openreach subsidy to do the works. When take-up
turns out after all to be commercially viable, Openreach returns the
subsidy to Connected Counties and it can be used for less commercially
viable areas. I am told this return of subsidy has happened in about
50% of cases. It seems to me that it clearly demonstrates that the
subsidy has been used for many areas that are in fact commercially
viable, meaning that less viable areas have had their roll-out delayed.
This overcautious assessment of commercial risk has meant that those
like me who pressed for subsidy for areas that are not commercially
viable, such as the North East Hertfordshire hamlets, have seen it
delayed and been disappointed.</hs_Para>

Ministers met the chief executive of Openreach, Clive Selley, and the
chief finance officer Matt Davies to discuss this and tighten up
assessment procedures? Since my latest push on speeding up broadband
roll-out, further progress has been made, and it has continued since
the last House of Commons Library information became available. The
leader of the county council has told me this week that the latest
assessment puts coverage in my constituency at 84%, but it is all by
fibre to the cabinet, rather than the fibre to the premises that is
needed in many small
hamlets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000160">I
was staying with friends this weekend in a very rural location in
deepest Suffolk and was surprised to learn that they have fibre to the
premises with high speeds, when my constituents 20 miles from London
have none. I have already taken up with Ministers, Openreach and
Hertfordshire County Council the particular case of Wellpond Green and
Westland Green, near Standon, whose residents petitioned the House
about their situation. In early 2016, many residents signed up with
Gigaclear, a competitor of Openreach, for superfast broadband to be
installed by March 2017. In about June 2016, Connected Counties, along
with Openreach, announced that it was to install superfast broadband in
those hamlets by March 2017. The effect was that many residents
withdrew from Gigaclear, which decided not to go ahead.</hs_Para>

in January 2017, to the anger and dismay of residents, Openreach
announced that the roll-out had to be re-mapped, and in June
2017 a timetable of 2018-19 was given for superfast broadband. That
caused understandable outrage, as the residents had only decided not to
proceed with Gigaclear because Openreach had offered the same timetable
of March
2017.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000162">I
have discussed that unacceptable situation with all those involved and
was pleased that Steve Haines of Openreach agreed to bring forward the
start of works in the hamlets to June 2018, but the Minister should be
aware of the great unhappiness locally with what has happened. Anything
she can do to encourage Openreach to bring forward the works even
further would be very helpful.</hs_Para>

that the national roll-out is an enormous undertaking with a limited
number of providers in the field. Nationally, a great deal has been
achieved. However, the subsidy for which I campaigned was designed
to ensure that areas that were not commercially viable were
connected up. In the past year we have seen coverage in my constituency
driven up from 67% to the current 84%, up 17%, but I want to see us hit
the county average before the end of 2018 and the national target as
soon after that as possible. In this day and age, people living in
rural locations near London expect superfast broadband, and it is in
the Government’s interest to achieve it. I hope the Minister
will ask Openreach, Connected Counties and Hertfordshire County Council
to do all they can to ensure that North East Hertfordshire comes up to
speed this year and that the unfairness for Wellpond and Westland
Greens is addressed
now.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2018-02-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2017_2019/DailyParts/2018_02_08_PT_1/8B863979FA3EA8B4BCB6B75C347DE93273269E25" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 February 2018">Thursday

connectivity is crucial, even more so in rural communities throughout
the UK than in our urban centres. The Government and local partners are
investing £1.7 billion in the superfast broadband programme. The
programme has provided superfast coverage with speeds of more than 24
megabits per second for more than 4.75 million premises in areas that
otherwise would not have been covered by a commercially funded
roll-out. Some 95% of homes and businesses in the UK can now access
superfast broadband, up from 45% in 2010. As a result of efficiency
savings in the initial roll-out, at least £210 million of
funding will be available to support further investment. Because of the
high levels of take-up, we will also have gainshare funding from the
additional profits from the network, projected to reach at least
£527 million. That means that a total of £737 million
will be available to support further

some figures. Since the beginning

access to more than 71,000 premises that otherwise would have been left

the scope of the Connected Counties project, Hertfordshire County

recognise that the communities that have not yet got coverage—my
right hon. and learned Friend referred to some of
them—will feel left out. In the case of Hertfordshire, the local
authority has managed the current delivery contract with BT to maximise
coverage to as many premises as possible, as quickly as possible. That
can sometimes leave gaps on the ground where some areas are covered and
adjacent areas are not, as my right hon. and learned Friend outlined in
his speech. However, the alternative would have been to prioritise some
communities over others during the roll-out, which would have been less
efficient and would have involved the local authority in making
invidious choices to determine which communities should get covered
first. In that context, the approach taken by Hertfordshire County
Council seems
reasonable<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T17:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>.

recognise the need to ensure that new housing has superfast coverage.
Openreach has committed that all new build developments with at least
30 properties will have fibre to the premises. That will ensure that
almost all new housing has full fibre access. We are also continuing to
focus very much on the remaining 5% of premises that do not yet have
superfast access. Across the UK as a whole, we are confident that at
least half the remaining premises will get that superfast coverage
through the continued
roll-out<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T17:14:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000170">However,
even with this further delivery, some premises will remain without the
superfast broadband that they need. We are therefore working hard on
our commitment to ensure universal high-speed broadband of at least
10 Mbps by 2020. We will shortly set out the design for a
legal right to high-speed broadband in secondary legislation, alongside
our detailed response to the consultation. Ofcom’s
implementation is expected to take two years from when we lay secondary
legislation, meeting the Government’s commitment of giving
everyone access to high-speed broadband by
2020<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T17:15:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020845000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/debtext/180208-0004.htm#18020845000171">In
the meantime, the Better Broadband Scheme is available for any home or
business with speeds below 2 Mbps. This provides a subsidy
of up to £350 for any eligible premises for satellite broadband
or, where available, other solutions including fixed 4G, fixed
wireless, or community fibre projects. This scheme has now supported
more than 13,000 homes and

that currently do not have superfast broadband can also consider the
option of undertaking their own community project. Community projects
can either be completely self-managed and delivered, or can involve
communities co-funding with providers such as BT, via the community
fibre partnerships scheme. Our focus until now has been on extending
superfast broadband coverage, but we also need to move to ensure a
transformation in the UK’s digital infrastructure, so that it is
based on fibre, or full fibre, to the premises. Currently, only 3% of
premises have a fibre optic connection. We accept that that is not good
enough. We have a target of at least 10 million premises having a full
fibre connection by 2022. Recent industry announcements show that that
is achievable.</hs_Para>

children’s centres across the country—there is an estate

offered support chiefly only for families with children up to the age
of five. Why not extend this to the wider family? Why not have family
hubs in local communities right across the country giving relationship
support and education at all life stages? That could support couples in
their own relationship, as parents or as grandparents. I know from the
Minister’s question to the Prime Minister last November that
that is a particular concern for him. Family hubs could also support
couples in marriage preparation, strengthen father involvement, and
support

or pressure point in a relationship. We are all aware of the importance
of early intervention in a child’s early years and how that can
be so effective for a child. Let us support early intervention in
couples’ relationships when they have challenges. Many cannot,

Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, will they consider
placing a statutory duty on local government authorities to make
fathers’ names compulsory on birth registrations wherever
practicable and possible? That would provide an opportunity to signpost
new parents to support services. Through structured, relaxed
conversations at family hubs, families could be identified who might
need support or where there are early warning signs of relationship
distress. We also need family hubs because we need places in every
community where people can go with relationship problems and not be
seen in a judgmental way. Over the years, every family will have its
challenges. Nobody judges if someone goes to the citizens advice bureau
or the doctor. Let us normalise getting help to strengthen family life,

towards the family hubs model, and at best practice where that exists?
Our group is doing research on best practice, which I would be happy to

for couples who take part in an accredited marriage preparation course.
If some of them take part in that course and decide that they have
different views on finance, bringing up children or who will work or
not work if a family comes along, and they decide not to marry, that is
a positive outcome. At least people will go into that relationship with

<?notus-xml column=641?>we are going through with the sham of our divorce laws. They say that we
should have a simple legal system—“I divorce you, I
divorce you, I divorce you”—and that is that. However, I
think that making life cheaper and easier for such couples would also
send a profound, wrong message and would make it easier for hundreds
and thousands of other families to break down. It would proclaim from
this House that marriage is just a legal device, like buying a home or
selling a company, and that we therefore want to get rid of any kind of
explanation for why people want to get divorced. Producing that reform
would be saying to the nation that encouraging couples to stay together
in marriage is not our first
priority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000081">Again,
repeated studies have shown that 90% of couples who manage to stay
together until their child is 15 will stay married. We know from all
those studies that family breakdown is a key driver for poverty among
women in particular, with half of all single parents living in poverty.
Those are the factors for which datasets are increasingly allowing
us—I hope—to understand the situation. We do understand
the situation: we understand that marriage works and that the breakdown
of marriage, or indeed marriage not taking place at all, drives many
people into a poorer outcome for life.</hs_Para>

Friend is leading the campaign, and we are encouraging her. We all want
better educational treatment for our children and a decline in juvenile
criminality; we want families to stay together. She is right to say
that, despite the appalling complexity and strength of the problems,
Government can at least attempt to be a facilitator of families and
married people staying together, rather than an enabler of
breakdown.</hs_Para>

Friend is right to highlight the steps that some authorities are
taking, such as family hubs. Benjamin Adlard Primary School is in
Gainsborough south-west ward, which is one of the 30 poorest wards in
the entire country. The headmaster, Sam Coy, runs the school, and I
have visited it. So many of the problems that his children exhibit are
due to family breakdown. I am delighted that he is leading the campaign
to have a family hub in Gainsborough. Of course, having a family hub
that gives help will not solve the problem—local authorities
taking an interest will not prevent societal trends that have been so
apparent for decades—but it is an attempt to do something. Brave
young headteachers such as the headteacher of Benjamin Adlard Primary
School should be given our
encouragement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000084">My
hon. Friend has mentioned the marriage allowance. A lot of people sneer
at the marriage allowance and say, “It’s just ridiculous.
Families don’t come together or split apart because of some
change in the benefit rules,” but most developed countries and
OECD members recognise family responsibility through family and
marriage allowances.</hs_Para>

the cost of family breakdown is £47 billion, as my
hon. Friend has explained, I do not believe that it is too much for the
Treasury to recognise marriage in the tax system through a marriage
allowance, for which I have campaigned for years. We are not trying to
use the tax or benefit system to try to get people together or to stay
together. All we are saying is that if one parent in a two-parent,
married family wants to stay at home to look after the children full
time, that should not be discouraged in the benefit system—that
is a profound injustice.</hs_Para>

had to drag the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer kicking and
screaming to bring in the allowance. He brought it in at a very low
level and it has never been pushed properly. There are still many
people inside Government and the civil service who do not like it and
would like it to fade away, but all it is trying to do is right an
injustice. If one person in a married couple wants to stay at home to
look after the children full time, they should not be financially
disadvantaged by the tax and benefit
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000087">Marriage
rates among the better-off are still very high, but at the less
well-off end of the spectrum they are much worse. Journalist Ed West
noted that research for <I>The Spectator</I> showed that, in 2000,
someone in the top socioeconomic class was 22% more likely to be
married than someone in the lowest socioeconomic class. By 2017, that
division had risen to 48%, and the crisis is growing. More needs to be
done.</hs_Para>

many ways society is infinitely more prosperous than when I

sympathise with the Minister. His civil servants will have done their

debate this subject, not just to talk in simple terms about a new
Cabinet Minister or something of that sort, although that is a good
step, but to say that there is something profoundly wrong in society
and that one of the reasons why society is an unhappier place now is
the massive breakdown and decline in religion, which did and does allow

we will be seen as putting ourselves on a soapbox and proclaiming that

contribution, I will tackle a specific aspect, which was touched on by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:27:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Congleton. An overlooked part of ensuring that families
are strong is the support given to families involved in the criminal
justice system. The excellent Lord Farmer review looked in detail at
the impact that good family work in our prisons can have on prisoners,
their families and society at large through a reduction in reoffending
rates.</hs_Para>

of two statistics that I will give during my speech: for a prisoner who
receives a visit from a partner or family member, the chances of
reoffending are 39% lower than for a prisoner who does not have a
similar visit. Support needs to be given for the benefit of the
prisoner and their family. If prison is truly to be a place of reform,
we cannot ignore the reality that there must be a supportive
relationship to help to achieve rehabilitation. The estimated cost of
reoffending is in the region of £15 billion a year,
so it is essential to find new ways of rehabilitation and of supporting
and cutting down those high rates of
reoffending.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000099">This

prisoner’s application for release on temporary licence, family
ties and supportive relationships should be a consideration. It should
be a priority to ensure that an offender can improve family
relationships ahead of release when it is safe to do so. A linked issue

struggle to find any advantages for families, to be perfectly
honest—it was a very difficult time in our lives. However, it is
important that the manifesto recognises the additional pressures and
challenges imposed not just by separation but by the difficulties of
living away from home. I hope that the Armed Forces (Flexible Working)
Act 2018, which has just been passed, will allow service personnel to
consider flexible working in some roles, which may improve the
experience for families in service

was also pleased to see the importance that the manifesto places on
fathers. It is crucial that the positive involvement of fathers is
recognised and supported in society. Fathers should be able to
participate fully in their children’s lives from day one.
Earlier this year, the Scottish Government published a review of
maternity and neonatal services in Scotland, which sets out a future
vision of maternity services in which fathers, partners and other
family members are encouraged and supported to become part of all
aspects of newborn care. It is important that we acknowledge fathers,
who often feel excluded from the experience, even if they are present

Government support policies that encourage flexible working and free
flexible childcare, to help to tackle the stigma affecting fathers who
take on caring roles and to encourage a work-life balance for parents.
Embracing flexible and family-friendly ways of working is not just the
right thing to do, but the smart thing to do, because it allows
employers to retain talented, productive staff. A 2014 study by the
Centre for Economics and Business Research revealed that a “work

to the

However, she said that family breakdown was the root cause of poverty,
whereas actually—statistically—poverty is the root cause
of family breakdown, and we must recognise that. While the Government
remain wedded to austerity, they can do little to alleviate the real
problems that households across the UK face. Of course a low-income
household can be a very happy one, but the reality is that anxiety
about money can place enormous strain on
relationships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000117">I<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:38:15"></hs_TimeCode>
must also mention the two-child limit on child tax credits, which
according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies will result
in 600,000 three-child families 
<?notus-xml column=646?>getting £2,500 less a year, and 300,000
families with four or more children getting £7,000 less. That
really will push people over the edge and into poverty. We need to
consider what we are doing. The Scottish National party strongly
opposes the cap, just as we oppose the removal of the family element of
universal credit, which is causing households to fall into
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:39:05"></hs_TimeCode>. The
policy has a particular financial impact on members of faith
communities who are more likely to have more than two children and
therefore more likely to struggle financially. Is the
Government’s intention really to punish people of faith?
I<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:39:30"></hs_TimeCode> believe that
all children should be treated equally and that families should be
financially supported to raise our future citizens. That can take place

also threatens families. Every week at my surgeries, I deal with issues
related to immigration and family reunion. I will mention two
particular cases. One involves a gentleman in my constituency who met
his wife while she was working in Glasgow on a short-term work visa.
They married, she went back to the States and found she was pregnant.
She had the child in the States, but because my constituent is
self-employed he has not reached the salary threshold for bringing her
here, his wife and their child are still in the States, and they cannot
all live as a family.

constituents is a gentleman who met his wife when he was working in
Saudi Arabia. She is from the Philippines. They lived for a number of
years in the Philippines very happily, but then his father became
unwell and so he travelled back to Scotland to look after his father.
He described being a “Skype family” for two years, until
his son came and joined him. Unfortunately, and again because he is
self-employed, he has not reached the salary threshold and cannot bring
his wife over. So they are still a “Skype family”,
although the child is in a different

I will hold a surgery, and the 10 or so people who attend will have a
range of problems. Some of them will come and tell me about their debt,
with the perhaps unrealistic expectation that there is something I can
do about it. Equally, there may be a problem with 
<?notus-xml column=647?>housing—perhaps the completely inadequate
nature of someone’s housing, which may be too small, or too
damp, or bed and breakfast accommodation, or indeed appalling neighbour
problems. It might be to do with schooling—not being able to get
their child into the school of choice, the school not being near
enough, problems with getting the child to the school, problems with
the child’s performance at school or their behaviour at school.

my part of the country, the problem might be lack of access to mental
health provision. It might be some other aspect of poverty, such as

of the cases that came through the door, the cause will have been
family breakdown. It is the surest way to poverty and it is for that

the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) warned him not to. I
mean that habit of quoting civil servants, or whatever. The
Under-Secretary responded to the debate by saying, “Well, of
course, of course, families come in many shapes and sizes.” I

it comes to this education consultation that is going on at the moment

to say that, whatever the continuing education requirement is,
relationships education must include family life. Actually, it is the

about marriage. Of course, we want relationship education—the
strength of relationship education—to be about marriage and
other relationships, not relationships including marriage.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:46:15"></hs_TimeCode> emphasis is
the other way round, which brings me neatly to the Bill that passed
last Friday promoted by
<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>our hon. Friend

Bill seeks<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:46:56"></hs_TimeCode> to
make civil partnerships available to mixed-sex couples. Civil
partnerships were introduced in 2002 only for single-sex
couples—same-sex couples—because marriage was not
available to them. His intention is that civil partnerships should be
extended; there should be equality and they should be extended to
mixed-sex couples.

understand that the Government’s intention is that the Bill will
be amended in the Bill Committee so that there is a review of whether
there should be such an extension. I have an open mind. I was accused

Sex Couples) Act 2013;
my<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:47:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

seems to me that there is a possibility that extending what is a

advantage.
Equally<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T14:47:59"></hs_TimeCode>, it may
be that, by introducing some form of “marriage-lite”, we
actually undermine marriage, by persuading people who do not feel that
they could go for the full-fat version that they can enter a civil
partnership, on the basis that it is not quite the real deal. In fact,
it is: the legal obligations and protection that provide for civil
partnerships are identical to marriage in almost absolutely every
respect, and I think it would be a mistake to persuade people that
somehow they were entering into a relationship that was less committed

provide training courses that will help with family breakdown. There

within a military environment there is scope for making such courses
available to both partners—not just the serving
partner—in a way that would not be available in civilian life.
After all, those of us who have served did our MATTs every year. I have
long ago forgotten what that stands for, but as well as the ordinary
battlefield drills, skill at arms, and nuclear, biological, chemical

want to concentrate on mental health, which is increasingly spoken
about in Parliament, which I welcome. The subject is sensitive to most
in the House, given the prevalence of mental health problems in many
families. According to the charity YoungMinds, one in 10 children has a
diagnosable mental health disorder—that equates to three
children in every classroom—and that statistic increases to one
in five for young adults. That is a profound hardship for individuals
and their loved ones. Due to its significant adverse effects on income,
wages, employment and social mobility, poor child mental health has
been calculated as having a lifetime cost in lost income of as much as
£388,000, and that is just the monetary cost—we also have
the more significant social and personal costs.</hs_Para>

determining a child’s mental health. Children of separated
parents or in challenged families have been shown to be 50% more likely
to fail at school, have low esteem, struggle with peer relationships
and have behavioural difficulties, anxiety or depression.
That is supported by a review of 18 international studies that was
published this year by the University of Sussex. It found that family
breakdown is consistently linked to higher risks of depression in
children. I draw attention to the fact that those are international

I say, the situation needs to change, and the Department for Work and
Pensions has begun to recognise that. The “Improving

programme to help workless parents to resolve conflict through

because the need is not just among workless parents. A far-reaching,
holistic, family-based approach to tackling children’s health is
needed, as the example in Middlewich shows.</hs_Para>

mental health teams would not be syphoning funds from where they are
most needed, but redirecting them to where they will be most effective.
Training would be required to enable professionals and frontline
workers to be confident in identifying and treating the needs of the
couple, alongside an efficient system of referral. The roll-out of
family hubs would facilitate a collaborative and consistent provision
of couples’ support in addressing children’s mental
health. Alongside providing for those affected by mental health
problems, that would also help to prevent the mental health problems
from arising by providing relationship support and encouraging the
involvement of fathers in the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:02:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) talked about
the reluctance of referring to faith and religious belief. I entirely
support what he said, but also, in our western, perhaps
individual-focused society, we do not recognise enough the support that
the wider family, indeed the community, can give to families. When I
was living with my family in Tanzania, we often came across a proverb
that was originally in Igbo, a Nigerian language, but in Swahili is,
“Inachukua kijiji kizima kumlea mtoto”, which means: it
takes a whole village to raise a child. If we view a village as our
community, we should not shy away from recognising that families cannot
do everything, as I know from my own experience. They come under great
pressure at various times. Parents are otherwise engaged, perhaps going
through crises themselves. It takes a community.</hs_Para>

constituency, and many others, we have an organisation called
Home-Start, which works with troubled families. The problem is that
Home-Start relies on volunteers who give their time. It takes
professional 
<?notus-xml column=652?>co-ordination, but we find that the funding for
that, which is frankly peanuts when one considers what else we spend
money on, is often the first to be cut, as I found in my constituency.
Local authorities who were very generous have been put under pressure
and, because it is not a statutory requirement, will remove the
funding. As a result, the whole service is put under pressure, and may
even disappear. These are people working on a voluntary basis with
families that are under pressure, and saving the state huge amounts of
money, because those families might otherwise fall into needing
extremely expensive services. In addition to the issue of mental
health, which I have spoken about at some length, I ask the Minister to
look at the possibility of making relatively small amounts of funding
available to schemes such as Home-Start. We are talking about a few
thousand pounds, or tens of thousands, in a whole local authority area.
The total cost for the country would be pretty minor, and the savings
substantial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000153">Finally,
colleagues may disagree, but I have found the value of family time at
meal times very important, as well as the value of not having
television. I have never had television, either as a child or an adult,
but if people do have a television, there is value in saying,
“Well, it has its place, but it shouldn’t be the centre
of family life, because it takes up so much time and stops people
talking to one another.” I think we can extend that to social
media. I was very encouraged to read in <I>The Evening Standard
</I>last week of a school, I think in London, which has ten
commandments about the use of social media. That school is really
improving the lives of the children, not by forbidding access to social
media, but by saying, “Let’s put less emphasis on social
media, and spend more time interacting with one another personally,

Manifesto to Strengthen Families” was published by a
group of Conservative MPs and peers in September 2017. I
agree with some of the recommendations of course—who would argue
against the Government focusing on promoting healthy relationships as
one way to tackle the country’s mental health crisis? Of course
that is important, as is the proposal to create family hubs to
co-locate superb early years health services and services that offer
help for parents with children across various age ranges.
That is exactly what the highly successful Sure Start programme,
introduced by the previous Labour Government, does. Why, then, have
more than 1,200 Sure Start centres been closed since 2010? That is a
severe reduction in essential support for many parents. Do the
Government recognise that the closure of Sure Starts was a mistake?

cuts to their budgets, and the cuts are having a detrimental effect on
family life. Children’s services will face a £2 billion
funding gap by 2020, yet in the recent draft local government finance
settlement, no extra money was committed for children’s
services, despite a 124% rise over the past 10 years in the number of

Labour Government took hundreds of thousands of children out of
poverty, but research published late last year by the Institute for
Fiscal Studies shows that the number of people living in poverty will
soar to a record 5.2 million over the next five years because the
Government’s social security cuts are biting deepest on
households with young families. As the IFS said, the benefit freeze,
the introduction of universal credit, and cuts to tax credits will mean
a surge in child poverty, and the steepest increases will be in the
most deprived parts of the country. That will have an impact on family
cohesion and relationships.</hs_Para>

credit was introduced to smooth the transition into work and lift
people out of poverty, but since 2010 work allowances and the taper
rate have been cut. Today the Work and Pensions Committee report on
universal credit has highlighted the Government’s inability to
provide evidence that universal credit will enable more people to find
work. I am talking about the full range of people: not just single
unemployed people, but disabled people, single parents, carers and the
self-employed, who are now claiming universal credit as the full
service is rolled out. Ministers continually refer to statistics that
cover only single unemployed claimants with no children; that is a
strange focus if the Government are committed to supporting
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000195">It
is important to consider the impact of the cuts to work allowances,
because so many people on low incomes are in insecure work. Low pay and
zero-hours contracts have an impact on the family life of hundreds of
thousands of people. They make life extremely difficult for parents who
have to pick up children from school or childcare, or arrange childcare
in the first place. It is difficult to do that if someone is on a
zero-hours contract. It is easy to highlight the importance of active
fatherhood in a child’s life, as the manifesto does, but
research by the TUC, published last summer, showed clearly that some
employers seek to prevent fathers and mothers from taking time off for
family emergencies.</hs_Para>

the eulogy centres on the family. People want to be remembered for the
family—for their contribution to family life and the stable
family life that they built. Families are at the centre of all our
individual lives. They provide us with a sense of stability, security
and purpose, sustaining us through times of emotional, health and
financial difficulty, and providing us with a sense of place and
fulfilment. We all experience families in different ways throughout our
lives, as children to our parents, as parents or indeed grandparents as
we grow older, as partners or through our extended relationships. To
answer a point made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:26:37"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for New Forest West (Sir Desmond Swayne), of course

the table to eat with the family has profound consequences. When
children eat with the family they learn many soft skills such as
conversational

the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) said, it is also a cross-cutting
issue where responsibilities lie with a number of different
Departments. As a Minister in the Cabinet Office, which has
responsibility for co-ordinating cross-Government work and policy, I am
responding to this wide-ranging debate on behalf of the Government.
Within the Cabinet Office, we are continually looking at ways to

matter of education. There are now 1.9 million children in good or
outstanding schools, which is a record number.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:35:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford raised some important points about mental
health. As was recognised, we are investing £1.4 billion in
mental health services for children and young people, and we have set
up a scheme in schools to raise awareness and help them to know how to
deal with individuals in schools suffering from mental health issues.
We have published a Green Paper to set out our plans to transform
mental health services in schools. My hon. Friend made an important
point about the need for a holistic, family approach to
mental health, and hopefully the Green Paper will be a
starting
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000219">As
I said, a route into meaningful work is very important for improving
children’s life chances. We now know that nearly three quarters
of children from workless households moved out of poverty when their
parents entered full-time work. That means 608,000 fewer children are
living in workless households.</hs_Para>

moving on to the contents of the manifesto, I would like to try to
address some of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Congleton. The importance of champions for the family in Government was
raised by several Members. As a starting point, I know that the Prime
Minister is personally committed to this—she is the principal
champion of families. We have already discussed the other Ministers
with family responsibilities, but I have certainly heard the point
about a specific, designated family Cabinet Minister loud and clear,
and I will relay that to my colleagues in Government.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020846000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000221"><hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:37:19"></hs_TimeCode>My
hon. Friend the Member for Congleton raised the DAD scheme. I
understand from my officials that the Department for Education has
funded a range of family advice and support services since 2008,
including Family Matters, which runs the website called DAD. The
service is well used and is valued by its users. Ministers at DFE are
considering the future requirements for the next financial year, so it
is under active consideration. I am sure the representations made by my
hon. Friend will have been heard loud and clear.
<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:37:54"></hs_TimeCode>On
children’s centres, an important point was raised
about family hubs. Clearly, local authorities have responsibility for
children’s centres and they are free to pioneer family hubs. As
my hon. Friend said, a great number are already doing so. She
highlighted Westminster and the Isle of Wight. I would urge other
councils to consider doing so.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend made an excellent representation on a transformation fund.
Sadly, it is entirely beyond my remit to make public spending
commitments, but I am sure the Chancellor will take note, particularly
regarding the £90 million in dormant bank accounts. On the
statutory duty to have the father’s name on birth certificates,
it is worth noting that 94% of birth certificates already have the
father’s name there, so we are making progress.</hs_Para>

relationships education, which came up in a number of contributions,
the call for evidence is out at the moment. Some passionate
pleas were made. I would urge hon. Members to respond to that call for
evidence—I believe it closes on Monday. That is the route for
formulating policy in that area. Again, I think a valuable point was
made about the need for an annual statement on strengthening families
and that is again something I will relay to my right hon. Friends in
Government.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Stafford talked about Home-Start,

to the substance of the debate: this excellent manifesto. The
Government introduced the family test in 2014 to bring a family
perspective into policy making. It helps to ensure that the impact on
family relationships and functioning, both positive and negative, is
recognised in the process of policy development, and it informs policy
decisions made by Ministers. We introduced the test to ensure that,
across Government, we think carefully about the potential for new
policies to support or undermine family relationships. The
Implementation Unit has a role in ensuring that the family test is
implemented. The test means that families are considered at the start
of any new policy
development<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000226"><B><Member ContinuationText="Margaret Greenwood" ContributionType="Start Intervention" HRSContentId="{B0CE9448-B5AE-4875-9A2D-F2E87DCD9DD3}" PimsId="6074" UID="18020846000337" xid="1317" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000337">Margaret

people on benefits should be subject to the same restraints as people
who go out to work. Anyone who goes out to work has to think carefully
about whether they can afford to have more children, and many people
choose not to have a third or fourth child. All the policy does is to
replicate that in the benefits system by ensuring a cap at two
children. It is a perfectly sensible policy with which many members of

the point about spending on childcare, I have already talked about the
role of parents in children’s development. Children from less
advantaged backgrounds are already behind in their learning by the time
they start school, and high-quality early learning from the age of two
can help us to close that gap. Parents have a vital role to play in
their child’s development. Evidence suggests that, aside from
maternal education, the home-learning environment is the single biggest
influence on a child’s vocabulary at the age of three. That is
why we have committed £5 million to trial evidence-based
home-learning environment support programmes in the north of
England—my<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:42:51"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Congleton referred to them. They will focus
on early language learning and literacy. We are currently running a
procurement exercise to identify an external organisation to work with
us in delivering that trial.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020846000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000231">The primary
purpose of providing free early learning places for two-year-olds is to
improve outcomes for children. We want to make it as easy as possible
for children to benefit from early education. One of the interesting
initiatives in that area is community-based nurseries, at which parents
volunteer in return for lower childcare fees. Disadvantaged families
are helped through the lower cost of childcare, and they learn parental

<?notus-xml column=663?>skills by working in the nurseries. A number of those trials have
already happened with voluntary organisations, and they have had very
positive outcomes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="18020846000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000232">The
“Manifesto to Strengthen Families” also recommended that
relationship education should be extended online, with a dedicated
campaign and virtual platform. The Government want to help all schools
to deliver high-quality relationships education and
relationships and sex education to ensure that pupils are taught about
healthy and respectful relationships, and that they stay safe and are
equipped with the knowledge they need to prepare for adult life. I
completely agree that it needs to cover concepts such as commitment,
respect and safety. Of course, marriage is a perfect example of all
those things. I urge hon. Members to make sure their views are heard as
part of that consultation process, because that evidence will shape
draft statutory guidance and regulations, which will be subject to
further consultation later this year. There will be many opportunities
for hon. Members to have an input into that process.</hs_Para>

the Government published our social mobility action plan, which set out
our ambition to close the word gap in early years. It is a clear
direction for all those that have a part to play, including
children’s centres. Our focus is on delivering that ambition. We
welcome the development of family hubs as one way to meet local needs.
We believe that local councils are best placed to understand local
needs, so if they believe there should be a family hub, they should be
free to set one
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000234">This
excellent manifesto also focused on health. The Government are already
working to reduce health inequalities by addressing the social causes
of ill-health, promoting healthier lifestyles and tackling differences
in outcomes of NHS services. We are doing that in a number of ways. We
are investing more than £16 billion over the current spending
period to support local public health services. That action is being
led locally to ensure that the solutions reflect the needs of
individual communities. Local authorities can also commission a range
of children’s public health programmes that support women in
pregnancy through childbirth and support children from early years
through to adolescence. Clinical commissioning groups and local
authorities are responsible for commissioning services to meet the
needs of their local populations. As part of that, we also need to look
at mental health. The Government are committed to parity between mental
and physical health, which has been one of the challenges in our health
service for successive Governments.</hs_Para>

contains <hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:46:35"></hs_TimeCode>an
excellent recommendation about maternity services and maximising the
involvement of fathers. Perhaps I can call myself a new dad—I
was certainly there at the birth of my two children. There
really are some excellent maternity services now. I was at a
midwife-led unit at Watford General Hospital, just outside my
constituency, and I saw how helpful it is to have a dedicated room in
which the birth takes place with en suite facilities. That helps the
father to be involved. That is why the Government have provided more
than £37 million of capital funding since 2013 to
support maternity services and to create safe, family-friendly
environments. That includes increased provision of facilities in labour
and post natal units, such as double beds, reclining 
<?notus-xml column=664?>chairs—which can be converted to beds for partners to rest in,
especially overnight, and remain with their partner and new-born
children—en suite toilets, new birthing pools, and dedicated

manifesto also raised the important issue of couples therapy. When
children arrive it is a time of great happiness, but it can put a
tremendous amount of strain on relationships, so it is
important that we focus resources at that stage. The NHS already offers
couple-based therapy as part of its Improving Access to Psychological
Therapies programme.</hs_Para>

addiction, many hon. Members eloquently made the point that families
play an absolutely central part in helping people through that very
challenging time in their lives. At a national level, we have extended
the troubled families programme to help local areas to ensure that

now specifically supports families with younger children and those with
a broader range of problems, including substance misuse, mental health
problems and domestic abuse.</hs_Para>

about police and crime commissioners working with schools in which
domestic abuse issues are prevalent, the Government are fully committed

to recognise the lifelong damage that domestic abuse does to children.

hon. Friend the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Michael
Tomlinson) made a passionate speech about the prison system and the
role of families. I was particularly struck by his statistic that
reoffending rates are 35% lower if partners and families are allowed to
visit. That is also borne out by other studies. The impact of
imprisonment on a family is likely to be long term, especially if the
main breadwinner of a family goes to prison—the problems back
home build up, with rent or mortgage arrears going up, and social
stigma and loneliness for the family left
behind.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="18020846000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201719/cmhansrd/cm180208/halltext/180208h0001.htm#18020846000240">While<hs_TimeCode time="2018-02-08T15:50:23"></hs_TimeCode>
offenders are in custody, therefore, we have an opportunity to support
them in changing their values and perspectives on their roles and
responsibilities. As a Government, we believe that prisoners who are in
touch with their family are likely to be more settled while in jail.
Multiply that improved mood among prisoners, and we see a
transformation in prison conditions. As we have heard, on 10 August
last year the Government published a review by Lord Farmer that made
several recommendations to strengthen family or significant other ties.

quiet reflection, and a place for families to visit and sit. I am
pleased with the way that the artist, Alison Wilding, and maker and

recognise that the regulation of all healthcare professionals needs to
be faster, simpler, better and less costly and are reviewing the
