abstract = {Alerting users about controversial search results can encour- age critical literacy, promote healthy civic discourse and counteract the “filter bubble” effect. Additionally, present- ing information to the user about the different stances or sides of the debate can help her navigate the landscape of search results. Our existing work made strides in the emerg- ing niche of controversy detection and analysis; we propose further work on automatic stance detection.},
