@article{Liu2010,
abstract = {Textual information in the world can be broadly categorized into two main types: facts and opinions. Facts are objective expressions about entities, events and their properties. Opinions are usually subjective expressions that describe peoples sentiments, appraisals or feelings toward entities, events and their properties. The concept of opinion is very broad. In this chapter, we only focus on opinion expressions that convey peoples positive or negative sentiments. Much of the existing research on textual information processing has been focused on mining and retrieval of factual information, e.g., information retrieval, Web search, text classification, text clustering and many other text mining and natural language processing tasks. Little work had been done on the processing of opinions until only recently. Yet, opinions are so important that whenever we need to make a decision we want to hear others opinions. This is not only true for individuals but also true for organizations.},

@article{Augenstein2016,
abstract = {Stance detection is the task of classifying the attitude expressed in a text towards a target such as Hillary Clinton to be "positive", negative" or "neutral". Previous work has assumed that either the target is mentioned in the text or that training data for every target is given. This paper considers the more challenging version of this task, where targets are not always mentioned and no training data is available for the test targets. We experiment with conditional LSTM encoding, which builds a representation of the tweet that is dependent on the target, and demonstrate that it outperforms encoding the tweet and the target independently. Performance is improved further when the conditional model is augmented with bidirectional encoding. We evaluate our approach on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus achieving performance second best only to a system trained on semi-automatically labelled tweets for the test target. When such weak supervision is added, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.},

@inproceedings{Onyimadu2014,
abstract = {This paper reports on our ongoing work on the analysis of sentiments, i.e., individual and collective stances, in Hansard (Hansard is a publicly available transcript of UK Parliamentary debates). Significant work has been carried out in the area of sentiment analysis particularly on reviews and social media but less so on political transcripts and debates. Parliamentary transcripts and debates are significantly different from blogs and reviews, e.g., the presence of sarcasm, interjections, irony and digression from the topic are commonplace increasing the complexity and difficulty in applying standard sentiment analysis techniques. In this paper we present our sentiment analysis methodology for parliamentary debate using known lexical and syntactic rules, word associations for the creation of a heuristic classifier capable of identifying sentiment carrying sentences and MP stance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

@article{Ferreira2016,
abstract = {We present Emergent, a novel data-set derived from a digital journalism project for ru-mour debunking. The data-set contains 300 rumoured claims and 2,595 associated news articles, collected and labelled by journalists with an estimation of their veracity (true, false or unverified). Each associated article is sum-marized into a headline and labelled to indi-cate whether its stance is for, against, or ob-serving the claim, where observing indicates that the article merely repeats the claim. Thus, Emergent provides a real-world data source for a variety of natural language processing tasks in the context of fact-checking. Fur-ther to presenting the dataset, we address the task of determining the article headline stance with respect to the claim. For this purpose we use a logistic regression classifier and de-velop features that examine the headline and its agreement with the claim. The accuracy achieved was 73{\%} which is 26{\%} higher than the one achieved by the Excitement Open Plat-form (Magnini et al., 2014).},

@book{Bird2009,
abstract = {This book offers a highly accessible introduction to natural language processing, the field that supports a variety of language technologies, from predictive text and email filtering to automatic summarization and translation. With it, you'll learn how to write Python programs that work with large collections of unstructured text. You'll access richly annotated datasets using a comprehensive range of linguistic data structures, and you'll understand the main algorithms for analyzing the content and structure of written communication. Packed with examples and exercises, Natural Language Processing with Python will help you:Extract information from unstructured text, either to guess the topic or identify "named entities" Analyze linguistic structure in text, including parsing and semantic analysis Access popular linguistic databases, including WordNet and treebanks Integrate techniques drawn from fields as diverse as linguistics and artificial intelligence This book will help you gain practical skills in natural language processing using the Python programming language and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) open source library. If you're interested in developing web applications, analyzing multilingual news sources, or documenting endangered languages - or if you're simply curious to have a programmer's perspective on how human language works - you'll find Natural Language Processing with Python both fascinating and immensely useful.},
