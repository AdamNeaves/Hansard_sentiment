I would like to express my thanks to Amanda Clare, my supervisor on this project, without whose guidance I would've gotten lost in the details.

I would also like to thank Tom Doyle, my friend, roommate, and fellow Comp Sci student for being a good listener when I needed to talk through a problem. He was the best rubber duck a programmer could ask for.

I'm grateful to my mother and sister for their support during my career as a student. Without their pushing I could never have achieved as much as I have.

Finally, I'd like to thank my partner, River. Without their patience I would not have known how to deal with the stress, and whose support was invaluable despite often not knowing what I was talking about.
